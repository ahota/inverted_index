9 79 
9 80 Enter RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, solus
9 81 
9 82   GLOUCESTER. Now is the winter of our discontent
9 83     Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
9 84     And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
9 85     In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
9 86     Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
9 87     Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
9 88     Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,
9 89     Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
9 90     Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,
9 91     And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
9 92     To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
9 93     He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
9 94     To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
9 95     But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
9 96     Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-
9 97     I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
9 98     To strut before a wanton ambling nymph-
9 99     I-that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
9 100     Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
9 101     Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
9 102     Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
9 103     And that so lamely and unfashionable
9 104     That dogs bark at me as I halt by them-
9 105     Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
9 106     Have no delight to pass away the time,
9 107     Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
9 108     And descant on mine own deformity.
9 109     And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
9 110     To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
9 111     I am determined to prove a villain
9 112     And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
9 113     Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
9 114     By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
9 115     To set my brother Clarence and the King
9 116     In deadly hate the one against the other;
9 117     And if King Edward be as true and just
9 118     As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
9 119     This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up-
9 120     About a prophecy which says that G
9 121     Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
9 122     Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.
9 123 
9 124              Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY
9 125 
9 126     Brother, good day. What means this armed guard
9 127     That waits upon your Grace?
9 128   CLARENCE. His Majesty,
9 129     Tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed
9 130     This conduct to convey me to th' Tower.
9 131   GLOUCESTER. Upon what cause?
9 132   CLARENCE. Because my name is George.
9 133   GLOUCESTER. Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:
9 134     He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
9 135     O, belike his Majesty hath some intent
9 136     That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower.
9 137     But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know?
9 138   CLARENCE. Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
9 139     As yet I do not; but, as I can learn,
9 140     He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
9 141     And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
9 142     And says a wizard told him that by G
9 143     His issue disinherited should be;
9 144     And, for my name of George begins with G,
9 145     It follows in his thought that I am he.
9 146     These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
9 147     Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me now.
9 148   GLOUCESTER. Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:
9 149     'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
9 150     My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
9 151     That tempers him to this extremity.
9 152     Was it not she and that good man of worship,
9 153     Antony Woodville, her brother there,
9 154     That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
9 155     From whence this present day he is delivered?
9 156     We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
9 157   CLARENCE. By heaven, I think there is no man is secure
9 158     But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds
9 159     That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.
9 160     Heard you not what an humble suppliant
9 161     Lord Hastings was, for her delivery?
9 162   GLOUCESTER. Humbly complaining to her deity
9 163     Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
9 164     I'll tell you what-I think it is our way,
9 165     If we will keep in favour with the King,
9 166     To be her men and wear her livery:
9 167     The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself,
9 168     Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
9 169     Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
9 170   BRAKENBURY. I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:
9 171     His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
9 172     That no man shall have private conference,
9 173     Of what degree soever, with your brother.
9 174   GLOUCESTER. Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
9 175     You may partake of any thing we say:
9 176     We speak no treason, man; we say the King
9 177     Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
9 178     Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
9 179     We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
9 180     A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
9 181     And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.
9 182     How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
9 183   BRAKENBURY. With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
9 184   GLOUCESTER. Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,
9 185     fellow,
9 186     He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
9 187     Were best to do it secretly alone.
9 188   BRAKENBURY. What one, my lord?
9 189   GLOUCESTER. Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?
9 190   BRAKENBURY. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and
9 191     withal
9 192     Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.
9 193   CLARENCE. We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will
9 194     obey.
9 195   GLOUCESTER. We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.
9 196     Brother, farewell; I will unto the King;
9 197     And whatsoe'er you will employ me in-
9 198     Were it to call King Edward's widow sister-
9 199     I will perform it to enfranchise you.
9 200     Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
9 201     Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
9 202   CLARENCE. I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
9 203   GLOUCESTER. Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
9 204     I will deliver or else lie for you.
9 205     Meantime, have patience.
9 206   CLARENCE. I must perforce. Farewell.
9 207                           Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and guard
9 208   GLOUCESTER. Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
9 209     Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
9 210     That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
9 211     If heaven will take the present at our hands.
9 212     But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?
9 213 
9 214                        Enter LORD HASTINGS
9 215 
9 216   HASTINGS. Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
9 217   GLOUCESTER. As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!
9 218     Well are you welcome to the open air.
9 219     How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
9 220   HASTINGS. With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;
9 221     But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
9 222     That were the cause of my imprisonment.
9 223   GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
9 224     For they that were your enemies are his,
9 225     And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
9 226   HASTINGS. More pity that the eagles should be mew'd
9 227     Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
9 228   GLOUCESTER. What news abroad?
9 229   HASTINGS. No news so bad abroad as this at home:
9 230     The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
9 231     And his physicians fear him mightily.
9 232   GLOUCESTER. Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.
9 233     O, he hath kept an evil diet long
9 234     And overmuch consum'd his royal person!
9 235     'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
9 236     Where is he? In his bed?
9 237   HASTINGS. He is.
9 238   GLOUCESTER. Go you before, and I will follow you.
9 239                                                    Exit HASTINGS
9 240     He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
9 241     Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.
9 242     I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
9 243     With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
9 244     And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
9 245     Clarence hath not another day to live;
9 246     Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
9 247     And leave the world for me to bustle in!
9 248     For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
9 249     What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
9 250     The readiest way to make the wench amends
9 251     Is to become her husband and her father;
9 252     The which will I-not all so much for love
9 253     As for another secret close intent
9 254     By marrying her which I must reach unto.
9 255     But yet I run before my horse to market.
9 256     Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns;
9 257     When they are gone, then must I count my gains.         Exit
9 258 
9 259 
9 260 
9 261 
9 262 SCENE 2.
9 263 
9 264 London. Another street
9 265 
9 266 Enter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH, with halberds to guard it;
9 267 LADY ANNE being the mourner, attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY
9 268 
9 269   ANNE. Set down, set down your honourable load-
9 270     If honour may be shrouded in a hearse;
9 271     Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
9 272     Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
9 273     Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
9 274     Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
9 275     Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
9 276     Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
9 277     To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
9 278     Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,
9 279     Stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds.
9 280     Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life
9 281     I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
9 282     O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!
9 283     Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!
9 284     Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
9 285     More direful hap betide that hated wretch
9 286     That makes us wretched by the death of thee
9 287     Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
9 288     Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
9 289     If ever he have child, abortive be it,
9 290     Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
9 291     Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
9 292     May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
9 293     And that be heir to his unhappiness!
9 294     If ever he have wife, let her be made
9 295     More miserable by the death of him
9 296     Than I am made by my young lord and thee!
9 297     Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
9 298     Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
9 299     And still as you are weary of this weight
9 300     Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
9 301                                 [The bearers take up the coffin]
9 302 
9 303                       Enter GLOUCESTER
9 304 
9 305   GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
9 306   ANNE. What black magician conjures up this fiend
9 307     To stop devoted charitable deeds?
9 308   GLOUCESTER. Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
9 309     I'll make a corse of him that disobeys!
9 310   FIRST GENTLEMAN. My lord, stand back, and let the coffin
9 311     pass.
9 312   GLOUCESTER. Unmannerd dog! Stand thou, when I command.
9 313     Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
9 314     Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot
9 315     And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
9 316                                [The bearers set down the coffin]
9 317   ANNE. What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
9 318     Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
9 319     And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
9 320     Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
9 321     Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
9 322     His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.
9 323   GLOUCESTER. Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
9 324   ANNE. Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;
9 325     For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
9 326     Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
9 327     If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
9 328     Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
9 329     O, gentlemen, see, see! Dead Henry's wounds
9 330     Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh.
9 331     Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,
9 332     For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
9 333     From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;
9 334     Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
9 335     Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
9 336     O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!
9 337     O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!
9 338     Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead;
9 339     Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
9 340     As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
9 341     Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered.
9 342   GLOUCESTER. Lady, you know no rules of charity,
9 343     Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
9 344   ANNE. Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:
9 345     No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
9 346   GLOUCESTER. But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
9 347   ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
9 348   GLOUCESTER. More wonderful when angels are so angry.
9 349     Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
9 350     Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
9 351     By circumstance but to acquit myself.
9 352   ANNE. Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,
9 353     Of these known evils but to give me leave
9 354     By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.
9 355   GLOUCESTER. Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
9 356     Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
9 357   ANNE. Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
9 358     No excuse current but to hang thyself.
9 359   GLOUCESTER. By such despair I should accuse myself.
9 360   ANNE. And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
9 361     For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
9 362     That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
9 363   GLOUCESTER. Say that I slew them not?
9 364   ANNE. Then say they were not slain.
9 365     But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.
9 366   GLOUCESTER. I did not kill your husband.
9 367   ANNE. Why, then he is alive.
9 368   GLOUCESTER. Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.
9 369   ANNE. In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
9 370     Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood;
9 371     The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
9 372     But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
9 373   GLOUCESTER. I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue
9 374     That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
9 375   ANNE. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
9 376     That never dream'st on aught but butcheries.
9 377     Didst thou not kill this king?
9 378   GLOUCESTER. I grant ye.
9 379   ANNE. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to
9 380     Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
9 381     O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
9 382   GLOUCESTER. The better for the King of Heaven, that hath
9 383     him.
9 384   ANNE. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
9 385   GLOUCESTER. Let him thank me that holp to send him
9 386     thither,
9 387     For he was fitter for that place than earth.
9 388   ANNE. And thou unfit for any place but hell.
9 389   GLOUCESTER. Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
9 390   ANNE. Some dungeon.
9 391   GLOUCESTER. Your bed-chamber.
9 392   ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
9 393   GLOUCESTER. So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
9 394   ANNE. I hope so.
9 395   GLOUCESTER. I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
9 396     To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
9 397     And fall something into a slower method-
9 398     Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
9 399     Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
9 400     As blameful as the executioner?
9 401   ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
9 402   GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect-
9 403     Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
9 404     To undertake the death of all the world
9 405     So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
9 406   ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
9 407     These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
9 408   GLOUCESTER. These eyes could not endure that beauty's
9 409     wreck;
9 410     You should not blemish it if I stood by.
9 411     As all the world is cheered by the sun,
9 412     So I by that; it is my day, my life.
9 413   ANNE. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
9 414   GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
9 415   ANNE. I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
9 416   GLOUCESTER. It is a quarrel most unnatural,
9 417     To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.
9 418   ANNE. It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
9 419     To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.
9 420   GLOUCESTER. He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband
9 421     Did it to help thee to a better husband.
9 422   ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
9 423   GLOUCESTER. He lives that loves thee better than he could.
9 424   ANNE. Name him.
9 425   GLOUCESTER. Plantagenet.
9 426   ANNE. Why, that was he.
9 427   GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of better nature.
9 428   ANNE. Where is he?
9 429   GLOUCESTER. Here.  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit
9 430     at me?
9 431   ANNE. Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
9 432   GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so sweet a place.
9 433   ANNE. Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
9 434     Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.
9 435   GLOUCESTER. Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
9 436   ANNE. Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
9 437   GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once;
9 438     For now they kill me with a living death.
9 439     Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
9 440     Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops-
9 441     These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,
9 442     No, when my father York and Edward wept
9 443     To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
9 444     When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;
9 445     Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
9 446     Told the sad story of my father's death,
9 447     And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
9 448     That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
9 449     Like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time
9 450     My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
9 451     And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
9 452     Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
9 453     I never sued to friend nor enemy;
9 454     My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
9 455     But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,
9 456     My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
9 457                                    [She looks scornfully at him]
9 458     Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made
9 459     For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
9 460     If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
9 461     Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
9 462     Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
9 463     And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
9 464     I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
9 465     And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
9 466       [He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword]
9 467     Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-
9 468     But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
9 469     Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward-
9 470     But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
9 471                                            [She falls the sword]
9 472     Take up the sword again, or take up me.
9 473   ANNE. Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,
9 474     I will not be thy executioner.
9 475   GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;
9 476   ANNE. I have already.
9 477   GLOUCESTER. That was in thy rage.
9 478     Speak it again, and even with the word
9 479     This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
9 480     Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;
9 481     To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
9 482   ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.
9 483   GLOUCESTER. 'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
9 484   ANNE. I fear me both are false.
9 485   GLOUCESTER. Then never was man true.
9 486   ANNE. well put up your sword.
9 487   GLOUCESTER. Say, then, my peace is made.
9 488   ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.
9 489   GLOUCESTER. But shall I live in hope?
9 490   ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.
9 491   GLOUCESTER. Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
9 492   ANNE. To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]
9 493   GLOUCESTER. Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
9 494     Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
9 495     Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
9 496     And if thy poor devoted servant may
9 497     But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
9 498     Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
9 499   ANNE. What is it?
9 500   GLOUCESTER. That it may please you leave these sad designs
9 501     To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,
9 502     And presently repair to Crosby House;
9 503     Where-after I have solemnly interr'd
9 504     At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king,
9 505     And wet his grave with my repentant tears-
9 506     I will with all expedient duty see you.
9 507     For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,
9 508     Grant me this boon.
9 509   ANNE. With all my heart; and much it joys me too
9 510     To see you are become so penitent.
9 511     Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
9 512   GLOUCESTER. Bid me farewell.
9 513   ANNE. 'Tis more than you deserve;
9 514     But since you teach me how to flatter you,
9 515     Imagine I have said farewell already.
9 516                              Exeunt two GENTLEMEN With LADY ANNE
9 517   GLOUCESTER. Sirs, take up the corse.
9 518   GENTLEMEN. Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
9 519   GLOUCESTER. No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.
9 520                                        Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
9 521     Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
9 522     Was ever woman in this humour won?
9 523     I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
9 524     What! I that kill'd her husband and his father-
9 525     To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
9 526     With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
9 527     The bleeding witness of my hatred by;
9 528     Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
9 529     And I no friends to back my suit at all
9 530     But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
9 531     And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
9 532     Ha!
9 533     Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
9 534     Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
9 535     Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
9 536     A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
9 537     Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,
9 538     Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal-
9 539     The spacious world cannot again afford;
9 540     And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
9 541     That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
9 542     And made her widow to a woeful bed?
9 543     On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
9 544     On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?
9 545     My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
9 546     I do mistake my person all this while.
9 547     Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
9 548     Myself to be a marv'llous proper man.
9 549     I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
9 550     And entertain a score or two of tailors
9 551     To study fashions to adorn my body.
9 552     Since I am crept in favour with myself,
9 553     I will maintain it with some little cost.
9 554     But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
9 555     And then return lamenting to my love.
9 556     Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
9 557     That I may see my shadow as I pass.                     Exit
9 558 
9 559 
9 560 
9 561 
9 562 SCENE 3.
9 563 
9 564 London. The palace
9 565 
9 566 Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, LORD RIVERS, and LORD GREY
9 567 
9 568   RIVERS. Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty
9 569     Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
9 570   GREY. In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
9 571     Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
9 572     And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.
9 573   QUEEN ELIZABETH. If he were dead, what would betide on
9 574     me?
9 575   GREY. No other harm but loss of such a lord.
9 576   QUEEN ELIZABETH. The loss of such a lord includes all
9 577     harms.
9 578   GREY. The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
9 579     To be your comforter when he is gone.
9 580   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, he is young; and his minority
9 581     Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
9 582     A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
9 583   RIVER. Is it concluded he shall be Protector?
9 584   QUEEN ELIZABETH. It is determin'd, not concluded yet;
9 585     But so it must be, if the King miscarry.
9 586 
9 587                      Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY
9 588 
9 589   GREY. Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.
9 590   BUCKINGHAM. Good time of day unto your royal Grace!
9 591   DERBY. God make your Majesty joyful as you have been.
9 592   QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Countess Richmond, good my Lord
9 593     of Derby,
9 594     To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
9 595     Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife
9 596     And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
9 597     I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
9 598   DERBY. I do beseech you, either not believe
9 599     The envious slanders of her false accusers;
9 600     Or, if she be accus'd on true report,
9 601     Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
9 602     From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.
9 603   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of
9 604     Derby?
9 605   DERBY. But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
9 606     Are come from visiting his Majesty.
9 607   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What likelihood of his amendment,
9 608     Lords?
9 609   BUCKINGHAM. Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks
9 610     cheerfully.
9 611   QUEEN ELIZABETH. God grant him health! Did you confer
9 612     with him?
9 613   BUCKINGHAM. Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement
9 614     Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
9 615     And between them and my Lord Chamberlain;
9 616     And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
9 617   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Would all were well! But that will
9 618     never be.
9 619     I fear our happiness is at the height.
9 620 
9 621               Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET
9 622 
9 623   GLOUCESTER. They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.
9 624     Who is it that complains unto the King
9 625     That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
9 626     By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
9 627     That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
9 628     Because I cannot flatter and look fair,
9 629     Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
9 630     Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
9 631     I must be held a rancorous enemy.
9 632     Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
9 633     But thus his simple truth must be abus'd
9 634     With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
9 635   GREY. To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
9 636   GLOUCESTER. To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
9 637     When have I injur'd thee? when done thee wrong,
9 638     Or thee, or thee, or any of your faction?
9 639     A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
9 640     Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-
9 641     Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while
9 642     But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
9 643   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the
9 644     matter.
9 645     The King, on his own royal disposition
9 646     And not provok'd by any suitor else-
9 647     Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred
9 648     That in your outward action shows itself
9 649     Against my children, brothers, and myself-
9 650     Makes him to send that he may learn the ground.
9 651   GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad
9 652     That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
9 653     Since every Jack became a gentleman,
9 654     There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
9 655   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, we know your meaning,
9 656     brother Gloucester:
9 657     You envy my advancement and my friends';
9 658     God grant we never may have need of you!
9 659   GLOUCESTER. Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.
9 660     Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
9 661     Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility
9 662     Held in contempt; while great promotions
9 663     Are daily given to ennoble those
9 664     That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.
9 665   QUEEN ELIZABETH. By Him that rais'd me to this careful
9 666     height
9 667     From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
9 668     I never did incense his Majesty
9 669     Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
9 670     An earnest advocate to plead for him.
9 671     My lord, you do me shameful injury
9 672     Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
9 673   GLOUCESTER. You may deny that you were not the mean
9 674     Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
9 675   RIVERS. She may, my lord; for-
9 676   GLOUCESTER. She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows
9 677     not so?
9 678     She may do more, sir, than denying that:
9 679     She may help you to many fair preferments
9 680     And then deny her aiding hand therein,
9 681     And lay those honours on your high desert.
9 682     What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she-
9 683   RIVERS. What, marry, may she?
9 684   GLOUCESTER. What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,
9 685     A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
9 686     Iwis your grandam had a worser match.
9 687   QUEEN ELIZABETH. My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long
9 688     borne
9 689     Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
9 690     By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty
9 691     Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd.
9 692     I had rather be a country servant-maid
9 693     Than a great queen with this condition-
9 694     To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at.
9 695 
9 696                 Enter old QUEEN MARGARET, behind
9 697 
9 698     Small joy have I in being England's Queen.
9 699   QUEEN MARGARET. And less'ned be that small, God, I
9 700     beseech Him!
9 701     Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me.
9 702   GLOUCESTER. What! Threat you me with telling of the
9 703     King?
9 704     Tell him and spare not. Look what I have said
9 705     I will avouch't in presence of the King.
9 706     I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tow'r.
9 707     'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
9 708   QUEEN MARGARET. Out, devil! I do remember them to
9 709     well:
9 710     Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,
9 711     And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
9 712   GLOUCESTER. Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband
9 713     King,
9 714     I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,
9 715     A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
9 716     A liberal rewarder of his friends;
9 717     To royalize his blood I spent mine own.
9 718   QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, and much better blood than his or
9 719     thine.
9 720   GLOUCESTER. In all which time you and your husband Grey
9 721     Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
9 722     And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
9 723     In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain?
9 724     Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
9 725     What you have been ere this, and what you are;
9 726     Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
9 727   QUEEN MARGARET. A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.
9 728   GLOUCESTER. Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,
9 729     Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!-
9 730   QUEEN MARGARET. Which God revenge!
9 731   GLOUCESTER. To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
9 732     And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
9 733     I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's,
9 734     Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.
9 735     I am too childish-foolish for this world.
9 736   QUEEN MARGARET. Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
9 737     world,
9 738     Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is.
9 739   RIVERS. My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
9 740     Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
9 741     We follow'd then our lord, our sovereign king.
9 742     So should we you, if you should be our king.
9 743   GLOUCESTER. If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar.
9 744     Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!
9 745   QUEEN ELIZABETH. As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
9 746     You should enjoy were you this country's king,
9 747     As little joy you may suppose in me
9 748     That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof.
9 749   QUEEN MARGARET. As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof;
9 750     For I am she, and altogether joyless.
9 751     I can no longer hold me patient.                 [Advancing]
9 752     Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
9 753     In sharing that which you have pill'd from me.
9 754     Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
9 755     If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects,
9 756     Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels?
9 757     Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!
9 758   GLOUCESTER. Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my
9 759     sight?
9 760   QUEEN MARGARET. But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,
9 761     That will I make before I let thee go.
9 762   GLOUCESTER. Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
9 763   QUEEN MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in
9 764     banishment
9 765     Than death can yield me here by my abode.
9 766     A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
9 767     And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.
9 768     This sorrow that I have by right is yours;
9 769     And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
9 770   GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on thee,
9 771     When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
9 772     And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
9 773     And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout
9 774     Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland-
9 775     His curses then from bitterness of soul
9 776     Denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee;
9 777     And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.
9 778   QUEEN ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the innocent.
9 779   HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
9 780     And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
9 781   RIVERS. Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
9 782   DORSET. No man but prophesied revenge for it.
9 783   BUCKINGHAM. Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
9 784   QUEEN MARGARET. What, were you snarling all before I came,
9 785     Ready to catch each other by the throat,
9 786     And turn you all your hatred now on me?
9 787     Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
9 788     That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
9 789     Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,
9 790     Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
9 791     Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
9 792     Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
9 793     Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,
9 794     As ours by murder, to make him a king!
9 795     Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,
9 796     For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,
9 797     Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
9 798     Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
9 799     Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
9 800     Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death,
9 801     And see another, as I see thee now,
9 802     Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
9 803     Long die thy happy days before thy death;
9 804     And, after many length'ned hours of grief,
9 805     Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Queen!
9 806     Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
9 807     And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
9 808     Was stabb'd with bloody daggers. God, I pray him,
9 809     That none of you may live his natural age,
9 810     But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
9 811   GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd
9 812     hag.
9 813   QUEEN MARGARET. And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou
9 814     shalt hear me.
9 815     If heaven have any grievous plague in store
9 816     Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
9 817     O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
9 818     And then hurl down their indignation
9 819     On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
9 820     The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul!
9 821     Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,
9 822     And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
9 823     No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
9 824     Unless it be while some tormenting dream
9 825     Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
9 826     Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog,
9 827     Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
9 828     The slave of nature and the son of hell,
9 829     Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb,
9 830     Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins,
9 831     Thou rag of honour, thou detested-
9 832   GLOUCESTER. Margaret!
9 833   QUEEN MARGARET. Richard!
9 834   GLOUCESTER. Ha?
9 835   QUEEN MARGARET. I call thee not.
9 836   GLOUCESTER. I cry thee mercy then, for I did think
9 837     That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
9 838   QUEEN MARGARET. Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply.
9 839     O, let me make the period to my curse!
9 840   GLOUCESTER. 'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.
9 841   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thus have you breath'd your curse
9 842     against yourself.
9 843   QUEEN MARGARET. Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my
9 844     fortune!
9 845     Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
9 846     Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
9 847     Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
9 848     The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
9 849     To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back'd toad.
9 850   HASTINGS. False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
9 851     Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
9 852   QUEEN MARGARET. Foul shame upon you! you have all
9 853     mov'd mine.
9 854   RIVERS. Were you well serv'd, you would be taught your
9 855       duty.
9 856   QUEEN MARGARET. To serve me well you all should do me
9 857     duty,
9 858     Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects.
9 859     O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
9 860   DORSET. Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
9 861   QUEEN MARGARET. Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert;
9 862     Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
9 863     O, that your young nobility could judge
9 864     What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!
9 865     They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,
9 866     And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.
9 867   GLOUCESTER. Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis.
9 868   DORSET. It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
9 869   GLOUCESTER. Ay, and much more; but I was born so high,
9 870     Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
9 871     And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.
9 872   QUEEN MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!
9 873     Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
9 874     Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
9 875     Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
9 876     Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
9 877     O God that seest it, do not suffer it;
9 878     As it is won with blood, lost be it so!
9 879   BUCKINGHAM. Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!
9 880   QUEEN MARGARET. Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
9 881     Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
9 882     And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd.
9 883     My charity is outrage, life my shame;
9 884     And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!
9 885   BUCKINGHAM. Have done, have done.
9 886   QUEEN MARGARET. O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy
9 887     hand
9 888     In sign of league and amity with thee.
9 889     Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
9 890     Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
9 891     Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
9 892   BUCKINGHAM. Nor no one here; for curses never pass
9 893     The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
9 894   QUEEN MARGARET. I will not think but they ascend the sky
9 895     And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
9 896     O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
9 897     Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
9 898     His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
9 899     Have not to do with him, beware of him;
9 900     Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,
9 901     And all their ministers attend on him.
9 902   GLOUCESTER. What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
9 903   BUCKINGHAM. Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
9 904   QUEEN MARGARET. What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle
9 905     counsel,
9 906     And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
9 907     O, but remember this another day,
9 908     When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
9 909     And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
9 910     Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
9 911     And he to yours, and all of you to God's!               Exit
9 912   BUCKINGHAM. My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
9 913   RIVERS. And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.
9 914   GLOUCESTER. I cannot blame her; by God's holy Mother,
9 915     She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
9 916     My part thereof that I have done to her.
9 917   QUEEN ELIZABETH. I never did her any to my knowledge.
9 918   GLOUCESTER. Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
9 919     I was too hot to do somebody good
9 920     That is too cold in thinking of it now.
9 921     Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;
9 922     He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains;
9 923     God pardon them that are the cause thereof!
9 924   RIVERS. A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
9 925     To pray for them that have done scathe to us!
9 926   GLOUCESTER. So do I ever-  [Aside]  being well advis'd;
9 927     For had I curs'd now, I had curs'd myself.
9 928 
9 929                          Enter CATESBY
9 930 
9 931   CATESBY. Madam, his Majesty doth can for you,
9 932     And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.
9 933   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go
9 934     with me?
9 935   RIVERS. We wait upon your Grace.
9 936                                        Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
9 937   GLOUCESTER. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
9 938     The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
9 939     I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
9 940     Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,
9 941     I do beweep to many simple gulls;
9 942     Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham;
9 943     And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies
9 944     That stir the King against the Duke my brother.
9 945     Now they believe it, and withal whet me
9 946     To be reveng'd on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;
9 947     But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture,
9 948     Tell them that God bids us do good for evil.
9 949     And thus I clothe my naked villainy
9 950     With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ,
9 951     And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
9 952 
9 953                        Enter two MURDERERS
9 954 
9 955     But, soft, here come my executioners.
9 956     How now, my hardy stout resolved mates!
9 957     Are you now going to dispatch this thing?
9 958   FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the
9 959     warrant,
9 960     That we may be admitted where he is.
9 961   GLOUCESTER. Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
9 962                                              [Gives the warrant]
9 963     When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
9 964     But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
9 965     Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
9 966     For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
9 967     May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.
9 968   FIRST MURDERER. Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to
9 969     prate;
9 970     Talkers are no good doers. Be assur'd
9 971     We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
9 972   GLOUCESTER. Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall
9 973     tears.
9 974     I like you, lads; about your business straight;
9 975     Go, go, dispatch.
9 976   FIRST MURDERER. We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt
9 977 
9 978 
9 979 
9 980 
9 981 SCENE 4.
9 982 
9 983 London. The Tower
9 984 
9 985 Enter CLARENCE and KEEPER
9 986 
9 987   KEEPER. Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
9 988   CLARENCE. O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
9 989     So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
9 990     That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
9 991     I would not spend another such a night
9 992     Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days-
9 993     So full of dismal terror was the time!
9 994   KEEPER. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you
9 995     tell me.
9 996   CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
9 997     And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
9 998     And in my company my brother Gloucester,
9 999     Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
9 1000     Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,
9 1001     And cited up a thousand heavy times,
9 1002     During the wars of York and Lancaster,
9 1003     That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along
9 1004     Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
9 1005     Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling
9 1006     Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard
9 1007     Into the tumbling billows of the main.
9 1008     O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,
9 1009     What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,
9 1010     What sights of ugly death within my eyes!
9 1011     Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
9 1012     A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
9 1013     Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
9 1014     Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
9 1015     All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
9 1016     Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes
9 1017     Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,
9 1018     As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
9 1019     That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
9 1020     And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.
9 1021   KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death
9 1022     To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
9 1023   CLARENCE. Methought I had; and often did I strive
9 1024     To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood
9 1025     Stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth
9 1026     To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air;
9 1027     But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
9 1028     Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.
9 1029   KEEPER. Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
9 1030   CLARENCE. No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life.
9 1031     O, then began the tempest to my soul!
9 1032     I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood
9 1033     With that sour ferryman which poets write of,
9 1034     Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
9 1035     The first that there did greet my stranger soul
9 1036     Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
9 1037     Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury
9 1038     Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
9 1039     And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by
9 1040     A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
9 1041     Dabbled in blood, and he shriek'd out aloud
9 1042     'Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,
9 1043     That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury.
9 1044     Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!'
9 1045     With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
9 1046     Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears
9 1047     Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,
9 1048     I trembling wak'd, and for a season after
9 1049     Could not believe but that I was in hell,
9 1050     Such terrible impression made my dream.
9 1051   KEEPER. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
9 1052     I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
9 1053   CLARENCE. Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things
9 1054     That now give evidence against my soul
9 1055     For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me!
9 1056     O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,
9 1057     But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,
9 1058     Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone;
9 1059     O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
9 1060     Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile;
9 1061     My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
9 1062   KEEPER. I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
9 1063                                                [CLARENCE sleeps]
9 1064 
9 1065                   Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant
9 1066 
9 1067   BRAKENBURY. Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
9 1068     Makes the night morning and the noontide night.
9 1069     Princes have but their titles for their glories,
9 1070     An outward honour for an inward toil;
9 1071     And for unfelt imaginations
9 1072     They often feel a world of restless cares,
9 1073     So that between their tides and low name
9 1074     There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
9 1075 
9 1076                       Enter the two MURDERERS
9 1077 
9 1078   FIRST MURDERER. Ho! who's here?
9 1079   BRAKENBURY. What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st
9 1080     thou hither?
9 1081   FIRST MURDERER. I would speak with Clarence, and I came
9 1082     hither on my legs.
9 1083   BRAKENBURY. What, so brief?
9 1084   SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let
9 1085     him see our commission and talk no more.
9 1086                                            [BRAKENBURY reads it]
9 1087   BRAKENBURY. I am, in this, commanded to deliver
9 1088     The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.
9 1089     I will not reason what is meant hereby,
9 1090     Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.
9 1091     There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.
9 1092     I'll to the King and signify to him
9 1093     That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.
9 1094   FIRST MURDERER. You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare
9 1095     you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER
9 1096   SECOND MURDERER. What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
9 1097   FIRST MURDERER. No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when
9 1098     he wakes.
9 1099   SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great
9 1100     judgment-day.
9 1101   FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
9 1102     sleeping.
9 1103   SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath
9 1104     bred a kind of remorse in me.
9 1105   FIRST MURDERER. What, art thou afraid?
9 1106   SECOND MURDERER. Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to
9 1107     be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can
9 1108     defend me.
9 1109   FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst been resolute.
9 1110   SECOND MURDERER. So I am, to let him live.
9 1111   FIRST MURDERER. I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and
9 1112     tell him so.
9 1113   SECOND MURDERER. Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this
9 1114     passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to
9 1115     hold me but while one tells twenty.
9 1116   FIRST MURDERER. How dost thou feel thyself now?
9 1117     SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
9 1118     are yet within me.
9 1119   FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's
9 1120     done.
9 1121   SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.
9 1122   FIRST MURDERER. Where's thy conscience now?
9 1123   SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!
9 1124   FIRST MURDERER. When he opens his purse to give us our
9 1125     reward, thy conscience flies out.
9 1126   SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or
9 1127     none will entertain it.
9 1128   FIRST MURDERER. What if it come to thee again?
9 1129   SECOND MURDERER. I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man
9 1130     coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man
9 1131     cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his
9 1132     neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame-
9 1133     fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man
9 1134     full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
9 1135     that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.
9 1136     It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;
9 1137     and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
9 1138     to himself and live without it.
9 1139   FIRST MURDERER. Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
9 1140     persuading me not to kill the Duke.
9 1141   SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe
9 1142     him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the
9 1143     sigh.
9 1144   FIRST MURDERER. I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with
9 1145     me.
9 1146   SECOND MURDERER. Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
9 1147     reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
9 1148   FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of
9 1149     thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the
9 1150     next room.
9 1151   SECOND MURDERER. O excellent device! and make a sop of
9 1152     him.
9 1153   FIRST MURDERER. Soft! he wakes.
9 1154   SECOND MURDERER. Strike!
9 1155   FIRST MURDERER. No, we'll reason with him.
9 1156   CLARENCE. Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.
9 1157   SECOND MURDERER. You shall have wine enough, my lord,
9 1158     anon.
9 1159   CLARENCE. In God's name, what art thou?
9 1160   FIRST MURDERER. A man, as you are.
9 1161   CLARENCE. But not as I am, royal.
9 1162   SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal.
9 1163   CLARENCE. Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
9 1164   FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my looks
9 1165     mine own.
9 1166   CLARENCE. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
9 1167     Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?
9 1168     Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
9 1169   SECOND MURDERER. To, to, to-
9 1170   CLARENCE. To murder me?
9 1171   BOTH MURDERERS. Ay, ay.
9 1172   CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
9 1173     And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
9 1174     Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
9 1175   FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King.
9 1176   CLARENCE. I shall be reconcil'd to him again.
9 1177   SECOND MURDERER. Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
9 1178   CLARENCE. Are you drawn forth among a world of men
9 1179     To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
9 1180     Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
9 1181     What lawful quest have given their verdict up
9 1182     Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd
9 1183     The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
9 1184     Before I be convict by course of law,
9 1185     To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
9 1186     I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
9 1187     By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
9 1188     That you depart and lay no hands on me.
9 1189     The deed you undertake is damnable.
9 1190   FIRST MURDERER. What we will do, we do upon command.
9 1191   SECOND MURDERER. And he that hath commanded is our
9 1192     King.
9 1193   CLARENCE. Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings
9 1194     Hath in the tables of his law commanded
9 1195     That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then
9 1196     Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
9 1197     Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand
9 1198     To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
9 1199   SECOND MURDERER. And that same vengeance doth he hurl
9 1200     on thee
9 1201     For false forswearing, and for murder too;
9 1202     Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
9 1203     In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
9 1204   FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God
9 1205     Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
9 1206     Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.
9 1207   SECOND MURDERER. Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
9 1208     defend.
9 1209   FIRST MURDERER. How canst thou urge God's dreadful law
9 1210     to us,
9 1211     When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
9 1212   CLARENCE. Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
9 1213     For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
9 1214     He sends you not to murder me for this,
9 1215     For in that sin he is as deep as I.
9 1216     If God will be avenged for the deed,
9 1217     O, know you yet He doth it publicly.
9 1218     Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm;
9 1219     He needs no indirect or lawless course
9 1220     To cut off those that have offended Him.
9 1221   FIRST MURDERER. Who made thee then a bloody minister
9 1222     When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
9 1223     That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
9 1224   CLARENCE. My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
9 1225   FIRST MURDERER. Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy
9 1226     faults,
9 1227     Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
9 1228   CLARENCE. If you do love my brother, hate not me;
9 1229     I am his brother, and I love him well.
9 1230     If you are hir'd for meed, go back again,
9 1231     And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
9 1232     Who shall reward you better for my life
9 1233     Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
9 1234   SECOND MURDERER. You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester
9 1235     hates you.
9 1236   CLARENCE. O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
9 1237     Go you to him from me.
9 1238   FIRST MURDERER. Ay, so we will.
9 1239   CLARENCE. Tell him when that our princely father York
9 1240     Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
9 1241     And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
9 1242     He little thought of this divided friendship.
9 1243     Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
9 1244   FIRST MURDERER. Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
9 1245   CLARENCE. O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
9 1246   FIRST MURDERER. Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you
9 1247     deceive yourself:
9 1248     'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
9 1249     CLARENCE. It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune
9 1250     And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs
9 1251     That he would labour my delivery.
9 1252   FIRST MURDERER. Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
9 1253     From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
9 1254   SECOND MURDERER. Make peace with God, for you must die,
9 1255     my lord.
9 1256   CLARENCE. Have you that holy feeling in your souls
9 1257     To counsel me to make my peace with God,
9 1258     And are you yet to your own souls so blind
9 1259     That you will war with God by murd'ring me?
9 1260     O, sirs, consider: they that set you on
9 1261     To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
9 1262   SECOND MURDERER. What shall we do?
9 1263   CLARENCE. Relent, and save your souls.
9 1264   FIRST MURDERER. Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
9 1265   CLARENCE. Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
9 1266     Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
9 1267     Being pent from liberty as I am now,
9 1268     If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
9 1269     Would not entreat for life?
9 1270     My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks;
9 1271     O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
9 1272     Come thou on my side and entreat for me-
9 1273     As you would beg were you in my distress.
9 1274     A begging prince what beggar pities not?
9 1275   SECOND MURDERER. Look behind you, my lord.
9 1276   FIRST MURDERER.  [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that. If all
9 1277     this will not do,
9 1278     I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
9 1279                                               Exit with the body
9 1280   SECOND MURDERER. A bloody deed, and desperately
9 1281     dispatch'd!
9 1282     How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
9 1283     Of this most grievous murder!
9 1284 
9 1285                        Re-enter FIRST MURDERER
9 1286 
9 1287   FIRST MURDERER-How now, what mean'st thou that thou
9 1288     help'st me not?
9 1289     By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have
9 1290     been!
9 1291   SECOND MURDERER. I would he knew that I had sav'd his
9 1292     brother!
9 1293     Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
9 1294     For I repent me that the Duke is slain.                 Exit
9 1295   FIRST MURDERER. So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
9 1296     Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,
9 1297     Till that the Duke give order for his burial;
9 1298     And when I have my meed, I will away;
9 1299     For this will out, and then I must not stay.            Exit

9 1315 ACT II. SCENE 1.
9 1316 
9 1317 London. The palace
9 1318 
9 1319 Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD sick, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DORSET,
9 1320 RIVERS,
9 1321 HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others
9 1322 
9 1323   KING EDWARD. Why, so. Now have I done a good day's
9 1324     work.
9 1325     You peers, continue this united league.
9 1326     I every day expect an embassage
9 1327     From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
9 1328     And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven,
9 1329     Since I have made my friends at peace on earth.
9 1330     Hastings and Rivers, take each other's hand;
9 1331     Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
9 1332   RIVERS. By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate;
9 1333     And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
9 1334   HASTINGS. So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
9 1335   KING EDWARD. Take heed you dally not before your king;
9 1336     Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
9 1337     Confound your hidden falsehood and award
9 1338     Either of you to be the other's end.
9 1339   HASTINGS. So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
9 1340   RIVERS. And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
9 1341   KING EDWARD. Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;
9 1342     Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you:
9 1343     You have been factious one against the other.
9 1344     Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
9 1345     And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
9 1346   QUEEN ELIZABETH. There, Hastings; I will never more
9 1347     remember
9 1348     Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
9 1349   KING EDWARD. Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord
9 1350     Marquis.
9 1351   DORSET. This interchange of love, I here protest,
9 1352     Upon my part shall be inviolable.
9 1353   HASTINGS. And so swear I.                       [They embrace]
9 1354   KING EDWARD. Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this
9 1355     league
9 1356     With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
9 1357     And make me happy in your unity.
9 1358   BUCKINGHAM.  [To the QUEEN]  Whenever Buckingham
9 1359     doth turn his hate
9 1360     Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
9 1361     Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
9 1362     With hate in those where I expect most love!
9 1363     When I have most need to employ a friend
9 1364     And most assured that he is a friend,
9 1365     Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
9 1366     Be he unto me! This do I beg of God
9 1367     When I am cold in love to you or yours.
9 1368                                                   [They embrace]
9 1369   KING EDWARD. A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
9 1370     Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
9 1371     There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
9 1372     To make the blessed period of this peace.
9 1373   BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time,
9 1374     Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke.
9 1375 
9 1376                       Enter GLOUCESTER, and RATCLIFF
9 1377 
9 1378   GLOUCESTER. Good morrow to my sovereign king and
9 1379     Queen;
9 1380     And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
9 1381   KING EDWARD. Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
9 1382     Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
9 1383     Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
9 1384     Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
9 1385   GLOUCESTER. A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.
9 1386     Among this princely heap, if any here,
9 1387     By false intelligence or wrong surmise,
9 1388     Hold me a foe-
9 1389     If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
9 1390     Have aught committed that is hardly borne
9 1391     To any in this presence, I desire
9 1392     To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
9 1393     'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
9 1394     I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
9 1395     First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
9 1396     Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
9 1397     Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
9 1398     If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;
9 1399     Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,
9 1400     That all without desert have frown'd on me;
9 1401     Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you;
9 1402     Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-indeed, of all.
9 1403     I do not know that Englishman alive
9 1404     With whom my soul is any jot at odds
9 1405     More than the infant that is born to-night.
9 1406     I thank my God for my humility.
9 1407   QUEEN ELIZABETH. A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
9 1408     I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
9 1409     My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness
9 1410     To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
9 1411   GLOUCESTER. Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,
9 1412     To be so flouted in this royal presence?
9 1413     Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead?
9 1414                                                 [They all start]
9 1415     You do him injury to scorn his corse.
9 1416   KING EDWARD. Who knows not he is dead! Who knows
9 1417     he is?
9 1418   QUEEN ELIZABETH. All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!
9 1419   BUCKINGHAM. Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
9 1420   DORSET. Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence
9 1421     But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
9 1422   KING EDWARD. Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd.
9 1423   GLOUCESTER. But he, poor man, by your first order died,
9 1424     And that a winged Mercury did bear;
9 1425     Some tardy cripple bare the countermand
9 1426     That came too lag to see him buried.
9 1427     God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
9 1428     Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood,
9 1429     Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
9 1430     And yet go current from suspicion!
9 1431 
9 1432                            Enter DERBY
9 1433 
9 1434   DERBY. A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
9 1435   KING EDWARD. I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow.
9 1436   DERBY. I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me.
9 1437   KING EDWARD. Then say at once what is it thou requests.
9 1438   DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
9 1439     Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman
9 1440     Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
9 1441   KING EDWARD. Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
9 1442     And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
9 1443     My brother killed no man-his fault was thought,
9 1444     And yet his punishment was bitter death.
9 1445     Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,
9 1446     Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?
9 1447     Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
9 1448     Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
9 1449     The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?
9 1450     Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury
9 1451     When Oxford had me down, he rescued me
9 1452     And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'?
9 1453     Who told me, when we both lay in the field
9 1454     Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
9 1455     Even in his garments, and did give himself,
9 1456     All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
9 1457     All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
9 1458     Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
9 1459     Had so much race to put it in my mind.
9 1460     But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
9 1461     Have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd
9 1462     The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
9 1463     You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
9 1464     And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.        [DERBY rises]
9 1465     But for my brother not a man would speak;
9 1466     Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
9 1467     For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
9 1468     Have been beholding to him in his life;
9 1469     Yet none of you would once beg for his life.
9 1470     O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
9 1471     On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this!
9 1472     Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, poor Clarence!
9 1473                                  Exeunt some with KING and QUEEN
9 1474   GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not
9 1475     How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
9 1476     Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
9 1477     O, they did urge it still unto the King!
9 1478     God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go
9 1479     To comfort Edward with our company?
9 1480   BUCKINGHAM. We wait upon your Grace.                    Exeunt
9 1481 
9 1482 
9 1483 
9 1484 
9 1485 SCENE 2.
9 1486 
9 1487 London. The palace
9 1488 
9 1489 Enter the old DUCHESS OF YORK, with the SON and DAUGHTER of
9 1490 CLARENCE
9 1491 
9 1492   SON. Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
9 1493   DUCHESS. No, boy.
9 1494   DAUGHTER. Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
9 1495     And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'?
9 1496   SON. Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
9 1497     And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
9 1498     If that our noble father were alive?
9 1499   DUCHESS. My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;
9 1500     I do lament the sickness of the King,
9 1501     As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
9 1502     It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
9 1503   SON. Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
9 1504     The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
9 1505     God will revenge it; whom I will importune
9 1506     With earnest prayers all to that effect.
9 1507   DAUGHTER. And so will I.
9 1508   DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you
9 1509     well.
9 1510     Incapable and shallow innocents,
9 1511     You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.
9 1512   SON. Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
9 1513     Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen,
9 1514     Devis'd impeachments to imprison him.
9 1515     And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
9 1516     And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
9 1517     Bade me rely on him as on my father,
9 1518     And he would love me dearly as a child.
9 1519   DUCHESS. Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,
9 1520     And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice!
9 1521     He is my son; ay, and therein my shame;
9 1522     Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
9 1523   SON. Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
9 1524   DUCHESS. Ay, boy.
9 1525   SON. I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
9 1526 
9 1527             Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her
9 1528                 ears; RIVERS and DORSET after her
9 1529 
9 1530   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and
9 1531     weep,
9 1532     To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
9 1533     I'll join with black despair against my soul
9 1534     And to myself become an enemy.
9 1535   DUCHESS. What means this scene of rude impatience?
9 1536   QUEEN ELIZABETH. To make an act of tragic violence.
9 1537   EDWARD, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.
9 1538     Why grow the branches when the root is gone?
9 1539     Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
9 1540     If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
9 1541     That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's,
9 1542     Or like obedient subjects follow him
9 1543     To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
9 1544   DUCHESS. Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
9 1545     As I had title in thy noble husband!
9 1546     I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
9 1547     And liv'd with looking on his images;
9 1548     But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
9 1549     Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
9 1550     And I for comfort have but one false glass,
9 1551     That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
9 1552     Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother
9 1553     And hast the comfort of thy children left;
9 1554     But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
9 1555     And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands-
9 1556     Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I-
9 1557     Thine being but a moiety of my moan-
9 1558     To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries?
9 1559   SON. Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!
9 1560     How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
9 1561   DAUGHTER. Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
9 1562     Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
9 1563   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Give me no help in lamentation;
9 1564     I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
9 1565     All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
9 1566     That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
9 1567     May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
9 1568     Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!
9 1569   CHILDREN. Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!
9 1570   DUCHESS. Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
9 1571   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What stay had I but Edward? and he's
9 1572     gone.
9 1573   CHILDREN. What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
9 1574   DUCHESS. What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
9 1575   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Was never widow had so dear a loss.
9 1576   CHILDREN. Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
9 1577   DUCHESS. Was never mother had so dear a loss.
9 1578     Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
9 1579     Their woes are parcell'd, mine is general.
9 1580     She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:
9 1581     I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she.
9 1582     These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I:
9 1583     I for an Edward weep, so do not they.
9 1584     Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,
9 1585     Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
9 1586     And I will pamper it with lamentation.
9 1587   DORSET. Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas'd
9 1588     That you take with unthankfulness his doing.
9 1589     In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful
9 1590     With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
9 1591     Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
9 1592     Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
9 1593     For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
9 1594   RIVERS. Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
9 1595     Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him;
9 1596     Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives.
9 1597     Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
9 1598     And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
9 1599 
9 1600                Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY,
9 1601                       HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF
9 1602 
9 1603   GLOUCESTER. Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause
9 1604     To wail the dimming of our shining star;
9 1605     But none can help our harms by wailing them.
9 1606     Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
9 1607     I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee
9 1608     I crave your blessing.
9 1609   DUCHESS. God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast,
9 1610     Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
9 1611   GLOUCESTER. Amen!  [Aside]  And make me die a good old
9 1612     man!
9 1613     That is the butt end of a mother's blessing;
9 1614     I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.
9 1615   BUCKINGHAM. You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing
9 1616     peers,
9 1617     That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
9 1618     Now cheer each other in each other's love.
9 1619     Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
9 1620     We are to reap the harvest of his son.
9 1621     The broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts,
9 1622     But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
9 1623     Must gently be preserv'd, cherish'd, and kept.
9 1624     Me seemeth good that, with some little train,
9 1625     Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet
9 1626     Hither to London, to be crown'd our King.
9 1627 
9 1628  RIVERS. Why with some little train, my Lord of
9 1629     Buckingham?
9 1630   BUCKINGHAM. Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude
9 1631     The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
9 1632     Which would be so much the more dangerous
9 1633     By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd;
9 1634     Where every horse bears his commanding rein
9 1635     And may direct his course as please himself,
9 1636     As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,
9 1637     In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
9 1638   GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with all of us;
9 1639     And the compact is firm and true in me.
9 1640   RIVERS. And so in me; and so, I think, in an.
9 1641     Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
9 1642     To no apparent likelihood of breach,
9 1643     Which haply by much company might be urg'd;
9 1644     Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
9 1645     That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.
9 1646   HASTINGS. And so say I.
9 1647   GLOUCESTER. Then be it so; and go we to determine
9 1648     Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
9 1649     Madam, and you, my sister, will you go
9 1650     To give your censures in this business?
9 1651                         Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
9 1652   BUCKINGHAM. My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
9 1653     For God sake, let not us two stay at home;
9 1654     For by the way I'll sort occasion,
9 1655     As index to the story we late talk'd of,
9 1656     To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince.
9 1657   GLOUCESTER. My other self, my counsel's consistory,
9 1658     My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,
9 1659     I, as a child, will go by thy direction.
9 1660     Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.        Exeunt
9 1661 
9 1662 
9 1663 
9 1664 
9 1665 SCENE 3.
9 1666 
9 1667 London. A street
9 1668 
9 1669 Enter one CITIZEN at one door, and another at the other
9 1670 
9 1671   FIRST CITIZEN. Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so
9 1672     fast?
9 1673   SECOND CITIZEN. I promise you, I scarcely know myself.
9 1674     Hear you the news abroad?
9 1675   FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead.
9 1676   SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the
9 1677     better.
9 1678     I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.
9 1679 
9 1680                         Enter another CITIZEN
9 1681 
9 1682   THIRD CITIZEN. Neighbours, God speed!
9 1683   FIRST CITIZEN. Give you good morrow, sir.
9 1684   THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward's
9 1685     death?
9 1686   SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
9 1687   THIRD CITIZEN. Then, masters, look to see a troublous
9 1688     world.
9 1689   FIRST CITIZEN. No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall
9 1690     reign.
9 1691   THIRD CITIZEN. Woe to that land that's govern'd by a child.
9 1692   SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government,
9 1693     Which, in his nonage, council under him,
9 1694     And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
9 1695     No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.
9 1696   FIRST CITIZEN. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
9 1697     Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
9 1698   THIRD CITIZEN. Stood the state so? No, no, good friends,
9 1699     God wot;
9 1700     For then this land was famously enrich'd
9 1701     With politic grave counsel; then the King
9 1702     Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.
9 1703   FIRST CITIZEN. Why, so hath this, both by his father and
9 1704     mother.
9 1705   THIRD CITIZEN. Better it were they all came by his father,
9 1706     Or by his father there were none at all;
9 1707     For emulation who shall now be nearest
9 1708     Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
9 1709     O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
9 1710     And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud;
9 1711     And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,
9 1712     This sickly land might solace as before.
9 1713   FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be
9 1714     well.
9 1715   THIRD CITIZEN. When clouds are seen, wise men put on
9 1716     their cloaks;
9 1717     When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;
9 1718     When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
9 1719     Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
9 1720     All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
9 1721     'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
9 1722   SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.
9 1723     You cannot reason almost with a man
9 1724     That looks not heavily and fun of dread.
9 1725   THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so;
9 1726     By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
9 1727     Ensuing danger; as by proof we see
9 1728     The water swell before a boist'rous storm.
9 1729     But leave it all to God. Whither away?
9 1730   SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
9 1731   THIRD CITIZEN. And so was I; I'll bear you company.
9 1732                                                           Exeunt
9 1733 
9 1734 
9 1735 
9 1736 
9 1737 SCENE 4.
9 1738 
9 1739 London. The palace
9 1740 
9 1741 Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the young DUKE OF YORK, QUEEN
9 1742 ELIZABETH,
9 1743 and the DUCHESS OF YORK
9 1744 
9 1745   ARCHBISHOP. Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,
9 1746     And at Northampton they do rest to-night;
9 1747     To-morrow or next day they will be here.
9 1748   DUCHESS. I long with all my heart to see the Prince.
9 1749     I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
9 1750   QUEEN ELIZABETH. But I hear no; they say my son of York
9 1751     Has almost overta'en him in his growth.
9 1752   YORK. Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
9 1753   DUCHESS. Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.
9 1754   YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
9 1755     My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
9 1756     More than my brother. 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester
9 1757     'Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.'
9 1758     And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
9 1759     Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.
9 1760   DUCHESS. Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
9 1761     In him that did object the same to thee.
9 1762     He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
9 1763     So long a-growing and so leisurely
9 1764     That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.
9 1765   ARCHBISHOP. And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
9 1766   DUCHESS. I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
9 1767   YORK. Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb'red,
9 1768     I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout
9 1769     To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
9 1770   DUCHESS. How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.
9 1771   YORK. Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
9 1772     That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.
9 1773     'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
9 1774     Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
9 1775   DUCHESS. I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
9 1776   YORK. Grandam, his nurse.
9 1777   DUCHESS. His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast
9 1778     born.
9 1779   YORK. If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
9 1780   QUEEN ELIZABETH. A parlous boy! Go to, you are too
9 1781     shrewd.
9 1782   ARCHBISHOP. Good madam, be not angry with the child.
9 1783   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Pitchers have ears.
9 1784 
9 1785                         Enter a MESSENGER
9 1786 
9 1787   ARCHBISHOP. Here comes a messenger. What news?
9 1788   MESSENGER. Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
9 1789   QUEEN ELIZABETH. How doth the Prince?
9 1790   MESSENGER. Well, madam, and in health.
9 1791   DUCHESS. What is thy news?
9 1792   MESSENGER. Lord Rivers and Lord Grey
9 1793     Are sent to Pomfret, and with them
9 1794     Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
9 1795   DUCHESS. Who hath committed them?
9 1796   MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
9 1797   ARCHBISHOP. For what offence?
9 1798   MESSENGER. The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd.
9 1799     Why or for what the nobles were committed
9 1800     Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
9 1801   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!
9 1802     The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind;
9 1803     Insulting tyranny begins to jet
9 1804     Upon the innocent and aweless throne.
9 1805     Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
9 1806     I see, as in a map, the end of all.
9 1807   DUCHESS. Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
9 1808     How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
9 1809     My husband lost his life to get the crown;
9 1810     And often up and down my sons were toss'd
9 1811     For me to joy and weep their gain and loss;
9 1812     And being seated, and domestic broils
9 1813     Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors
9 1814     Make war upon themselves-brother to brother,
9 1815     Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous
9 1816     And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,
9 1817     Or let me die, to look on death no more!
9 1818   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we will to
9 1819     sanctuary.
9 1820     Madam, farewell.
9 1821   DUCHESS. Stay, I will go with you.
9 1822   QUEEN ELIZABETH. You have no cause.
9 1823   ARCHBISHOP.  [To the QUEEN]  My gracious lady, go.
9 1824     And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
9 1825     For my part, I'll resign unto your Grace
9 1826     The seal I keep; and so betide to me
9 1827     As well I tender you and all of yours!
9 1828     Go, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.                Exeunt

9 1844 ACT III. SCENE 1.
9 1845 
9 1846 London. A street
9 1847 
9 1848 The trumpets sound. Enter the PRINCE OF WALES, GLOUCESTER,
9 1849 BUCKINGHAM,
9 1850 CATESBY, CARDINAL BOURCHIER, and others
9 1851 
9 1852   BUCKINGHAM. Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your
9 1853     chamber.
9 1854   GLOUCESTER. Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.
9 1855     The weary way hath made you melancholy.
9 1856   PRINCE. No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
9 1857     Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.
9 1858     I want more uncles here to welcome me.
9 1859   GLOUCESTER. Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your
9 1860     years
9 1861     Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit;
9 1862     Nor more can you distinguish of a man
9 1863     Than of his outward show; which, God He knows,
9 1864     Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
9 1865     Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
9 1866     Your Grace attended to their sug'red words
9 1867     But look'd not on the poison of their hearts.
9 1868     God keep you from them and from such false friends!
9 1869   PRINCE. God keep me from false friends! but they were
9 1870     none.
9 1871   GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet
9 1872     you.
9 1873 
9 1874                 Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train
9 1875 
9 1876   MAYOR. God bless your Grace with health and happy days!
9 1877   PRINCE. I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.
9 1878     I thought my mother and my brother York
9 1879     Would long ere this have met us on the way.
9 1880     Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
9 1881     To tell us whether they will come or no!
9 1882 
9 1883                         Enter LORD HASTINGS
9 1884 
9 1885   BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time, here comes the sweating
9 1886     Lord.
9 1887   PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?
9 1888   HASTINGS. On what occasion, God He knows, not I,
9 1889     The Queen your mother and your brother York
9 1890     Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince
9 1891     Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,
9 1892     But by his mother was perforce withheld.
9 1893   BUCKINGHAM. Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
9 1894     Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, will your Grace
9 1895     Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
9 1896     Unto his princely brother presently?
9 1897     If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him
9 1898     And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
9 1899   CARDINAL. My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
9 1900     Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
9 1901     Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
9 1902     To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
9 1903     We should infringe the holy privilege
9 1904     Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land
9 1905     Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
9 1906   BUCKINGHAM. You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
9 1907     Too ceremonious and traditional.
9 1908     Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
9 1909     You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
9 1910     The benefit thereof is always granted
9 1911     To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place
9 1912     And those who have the wit to claim the place.
9 1913     This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it,
9 1914     And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
9 1915     Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
9 1916     You break no privilege nor charter there.
9 1917     Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
9 1918     But sanctuary children never till now.
9 1919   CARDINAL. My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.
9 1920     Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
9 1921   HASTINGS. I go, my lord.
9 1922   PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
9 1923                                     Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
9 1924     Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
9 1925     Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
9 1926   GLOUCESTER. Where it seems best unto your royal self.
9 1927     If I may counsel you, some day or two
9 1928     Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower,
9 1929     Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
9 1930     For your best health and recreation.
9 1931   PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place.
9 1932     Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
9 1933   BUCKINGHAM. He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
9 1934     Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
9 1935   PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported
9 1936     Successively from age to age, he built it?
9 1937   BUCKINGHAM. Upon record, my gracious lord.
9 1938   PRINCE. But say, my lord, it were not regist'red,
9 1939     Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age,
9 1940     As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
9 1941     Even to the general all-ending day.
9 1942   GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
9 1943     live long.
9 1944   PRINCE. What say you, uncle?
9 1945   GLOUCESTER. I say, without characters, fame lives long.
9 1946     [Aside]  Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
9 1947     I moralize two meanings in one word.
9 1948   PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
9 1949     With what his valour did enrich his wit,
9 1950     His wit set down to make his valour live.
9 1951     Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
9 1952     For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
9 1953     I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-
9 1954   BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?
9 1955   PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man,
9 1956     I'll win our ancient right in France again,
9 1957     Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.
9 1958   GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward
9 1959     spring.
9 1960 
9 1961               Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL
9 1962 
9 1963   BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of
9 1964     York.
9 1965   PRINCE. Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?
9 1966   YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.
9 1967   PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours.
9 1968     Too late he died that might have kept that title,
9 1969     Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
9 1970   GLOUCESTER. How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
9 1971   YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
9 1972     You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
9 1973     The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
9 1974   GLOUCESTER. He hath, my lord.
9 1975   YORK. And therefore is he idle?
9 1976   GLOUCESTER. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
9 1977   YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I.
9 1978   GLOUCESTER. He may command me as my sovereign;
9 1979     But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
9 1980   YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
9 1981   GLOUCESTER. My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart!
9 1982   PRINCE. A beggar, brother?
9 1983   YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
9 1984     And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
9 1985   GLOUCESTER. A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
9 1986   YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it!
9 1987   GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
9 1988   YORK. O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:
9 1989     In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
9 1990   GLOUCESTER. It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.
9 1991   YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
9 1992   GLOUCESTER. What, would you have my weapon, little
9 1993     Lord?
9 1994   YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
9 1995   GLOUCESTER. How?
9 1996   YORK. Little.
9 1997   PRINCE. My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.
9 1998     Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
9 1999   YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.
9 2000     Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
9 2001     Because that I am little, like an ape,
9 2002     He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
9 2003   BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
9 2004     To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
9 2005     He prettily and aptly taunts himself.
9 2006     So cunning and so young is wonderful.
9 2007   GLOUCESTER. My lord, will't please you pass along?
9 2008     Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
9 2009     Will to your mother, to entreat of her
9 2010     To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
9 2011   YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
9 2012   PRINCE. My Lord Protector needs will have it so.
9 2013   YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
9 2014   GLOUCESTER. Why, what should you fear?
9 2015   YORK. Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
9 2016     My grandam told me he was murder'd there.
9 2017   PRINCE. I fear no uncles dead.
9 2018   GLOUCESTER. Nor none that live, I hope.
9 2019   PRINCE. An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
9 2020     But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
9 2021     Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
9 2022     A sennet.
9 2023               Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and CATESBY
9 2024   BUCKINGHAM. Think you, my lord, this little prating York
9 2025     Was not incensed by his subtle mother
9 2026     To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
9 2027   GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a perilous boy;
9 2028     Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.
9 2029     He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
9 2030   BUCKINGHAM. Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
9 2031     Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
9 2032     As closely to conceal what we impart.
9 2033     Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way.
9 2034     What think'st thou? Is it not an easy matter
9 2035     To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
9 2036     For the instalment of this noble Duke
9 2037     In the seat royal of this famous isle?
9 2038   CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince
9 2039     That he will not be won to aught against him.
9 2040   BUCKINGHAM. What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will
9 2041     not he?
9 2042   CATESBY. He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
9 2043   BUCKINGHAM. Well then, no more but this: go, gentle
9 2044     Catesby,
9 2045     And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
9 2046     How he doth stand affected to our purpose;
9 2047     And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
9 2048     To sit about the coronation.
9 2049     If thou dost find him tractable to us,
9 2050     Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons;
9 2051     If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,
9 2052     Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,
9 2053     And give us notice of his inclination;
9 2054     For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
9 2055     Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
9 2056   GLOUCESTER. Commend me to Lord William. Tell him,
9 2057     Catesby,
9 2058     His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
9 2059     To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;
9 2060     And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
9 2061     Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
9 2062   BUCKINGHAM. Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.
9 2063   CATESBY. My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
9 2064   GLOUCESTER. Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
9 2065   CATESBY. You shall, my lord.
9 2066   GLOUCESTER. At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.
9 2067                                                     Exit CATESBY
9 2068   BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we
9 2069     perceive
9 2070     Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
9 2071   GLOUCESTER. Chop off his head-something we will
9 2072     determine.
9 2073     And, look when I am King, claim thou of me
9 2074     The earldom of Hereford and all the movables
9 2075     Whereof the King my brother was possess'd.
9 2076   BUCKINGHAM. I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.
9 2077   GLOUCESTER. And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
9 2078     Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
9 2079     We may digest our complots in some form.              Exeunt
9 2080 
9 2081 
9 2082 
9 2083 
9 2084 SCENE 2.
9 2085 
9 2086 Before LORD HASTING'S house
9 2087 
9 2088 Enter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS
9 2089 
9 2090   MESSENGER. My lord, my lord!                        [Knocking]
9 2091   HASTINGS.  [Within]  Who knocks?
9 2092   MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley.
9 2093   HASTINGS.  [Within]  What is't o'clock?
9 2094   MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four.
9 2095 
9 2096                         Enter LORD HASTINGS
9 2097 
9 2098   HASTINGS. Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious
9 2099     nights?
9 2100   MESSENGER. So it appears by that I have to say.
9 2101     First, he commends him to your noble self.
9 2102   HASTINGS. What then?
9 2103   MESSENGER. Then certifies your lordship that this night
9 2104     He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.
9 2105     Besides, he says there are two councils kept,
9 2106     And that may be determin'd at the one
9 2107     Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
9 2108     Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure-
9 2109     If you will presently take horse with him
9 2110     And with all speed post with him toward the north
9 2111     To shun the danger that his soul divines.
9 2112   HASTINGS. Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
9 2113     Bid him not fear the separated council:
9 2114     His honour and myself are at the one,
9 2115     And at the other is my good friend Catesby;
9 2116     Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
9 2117     Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
9 2118     Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;
9 2119     And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple
9 2120     To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers.
9 2121     To fly the boar before the boar pursues
9 2122     Were to incense the boar to follow us
9 2123     And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
9 2124     Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;
9 2125     And we will both together to the Tower,
9 2126     Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
9 2127   MESSENGER. I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
9 2128  Exit
9 2129 
9 2130                          Enter CATESBY
9 2131 
9 2132   CATESBY. Many good morrows to my noble lord!
9 2133   HASTINGS. Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring.
9 2134     What news, what news, in this our tott'ring state?
9 2135   CATESBY. It is a reeling world indeed, my lord;
9 2136     And I believe will never stand upright
9 2137     Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
9 2138   HASTINGS. How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the
9 2139     crown?
9 2140   CATESBY. Ay, my good lord.
9 2141   HASTINGS. I'll have this crown of mine cut from my
9 2142     shoulders
9 2143     Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd.
9 2144     But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
9 2145   CATESBY. Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
9 2146     Upon his party for the gain thereof;
9 2147     And thereupon he sends you this good news,
9 2148     That this same very day your enemies,
9 2149     The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.
9 2150   HASTINGS. Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
9 2151     Because they have been still my adversaries;
9 2152     But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side
9 2153     To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
9 2154     God knows I will not do it to the death.
9 2155   CATESBY. God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
9 2156   HASTINGS. But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,
9 2157     That they which brought me in my master's hate,
9 2158     I live to look upon their tragedy.
9 2159     Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,
9 2160     I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.
9 2161   CATESBY. 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
9 2162     When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.
9 2163   HASTINGS. O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
9 2164     With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do
9 2165     With some men else that think themselves as safe
9 2166     As thou and I, who, as thou knowest, are dear
9 2167     To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
9 2168   CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you-
9 2169     [Aside]  For they account his head upon the bridge.
9 2170   HASTINGS. I know they do, and I have well deserv'd it.
9 2171 
9 2172                       Enter LORD STANLEY
9 2173 
9 2174     Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
9 2175     Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
9 2176   STANLEY. My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby.
9 2177     You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
9 2178     I do not like these several councils, I.
9 2179   HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,
9 2180     And never in my days, I do protest,
9 2181     Was it so precious to me as 'tis now.
9 2182     Think you, but that I know our state secure,
9 2183     I would be so triumphant as I am?
9 2184   STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from
9 2185     London,
9 2186     Were jocund and suppos'd their states were sure,
9 2187     And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
9 2188     But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.
9 2189     This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;
9 2190     Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward.
9 2191     What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.
9 2192   HASTINGS. Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my
9 2193     Lord?
9 2194     To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded.
9 2195   STANLEY. They, for their truth, might better wear their
9 2196     heads
9 2197     Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats.
9 2198     But come, my lord, let's away.
9 2199 
9 2200                  Enter HASTINGS, a pursuivant
9 2201 
9 2202   HASTINGS. Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
9 2203                                       Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
9 2204     How now, Hastings! How goes the world with thee?
9 2205   PURSUIVANT. The better that your lordship please to ask.
9 2206   HASTINGS. I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
9 2207     Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet:
9 2208     Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
9 2209     By the suggestion of the Queen's allies;
9 2210     But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself-
9 2211     This day those enernies are put to death,
9 2212     And I in better state than e'er I was.
9 2213   PURSUIVANT. God hold it, to your honour's good content!
9 2214   HASTINGS. Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me.
9 2215                                           [Throws him his purse]
9 2216   PURSUIVANT. I thank your honour.                          Exit
9 2217 
9 2218                             Enter a PRIEST
9 2219 
9 2220   PRIEST. Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
9 2221   HASTINGS. I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
9 2222     I am in your debt for your last exercise;
9 2223     Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
9 2224                                         [He whispers in his ear]
9 2225   PRIEST. I'll wait upon your lordship.
9 2226 
9 2227                             Enter BUCKINGHAM
9 2228 
9 2229   BUCKINGHAM. What, talking with a priest, Lord
9 2230     Chamberlain!
9 2231     Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:
9 2232     Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
9 2233   HASTINGS. Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
9 2234     The men you talk of came into my mind.
9 2235     What, go you toward the Tower?
9 2236   BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there;
9 2237     I shall return before your lordship thence.
9 2238   HASTINGS. Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
9 2239   BUCKINGHAM.  [Aside]  And supper too, although thou
9 2240     knowest it not.-
9 2241     Come, will you go?
9 2242   HASTINGS. I'll wait upon your lordship.                 Exeunt
9 2243 
9 2244 
9 2245 
9 2246 
9 2247 SCENE 3.
9 2248 
9 2249 Pomfret Castle
9 2250 
9 2251 Enter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying the Nobles,
9 2252 RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN, to death
9 2253 
9 2254   RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
9 2255     To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
9 2256     For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
9 2257   GREY. God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!
9 2258     A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
9 2259   VAUGHAN. You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.
9 2260   RATCLIFF. Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
9 2261   RIVERS. O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
9 2262     Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
9 2263     Within the guilty closure of thy walls
9 2264   RICHARD the Second here was hack'd to death;
9 2265     And for more slander to thy dismal seat,
9 2266     We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.
9 2267   GREY. Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
9 2268     When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I,
9 2269     For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
9 2270   RIVERS. Then curs'd she Richard, then curs'd she
9 2271     Buckingham,
9 2272     Then curs'd she Hastings. O, remember, God,
9 2273     To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!
9 2274     And for my sister, and her princely sons,
9 2275     Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
9 2276     Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
9 2277   RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
9 2278   RIVERS. Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.
9 2279     Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.              Exeunt
9 2280 
9 2281 
9 2282 
9 2283 
9 2284 SCENE 4
9 2285 
9 2286 London. The Tower
9 2287 
9 2288 Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP of ELY, RATCLIFF,
9 2289 LOVEL,
9 2290 with others and seat themselves at a table
9 2291 
9 2292   HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met
9 2293     Is to determine of the coronation.
9 2294     In God's name speak-when is the royal day?
9 2295   BUCKINGHAM. Is all things ready for the royal time?
9 2296   DERBY. It is, and wants but nomination.
9 2297   BISHOP OF ELY. To-morrow then I judge a happy day.
9 2298   BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector's mind
9 2299     herein?
9 2300     Who is most inward with the noble Duke?
9 2301   BISHOP OF ELY. Your Grace, we think, should soonest know
9 2302     his mind.
9 2303   BUCKINGHAM. We know each other's faces; for our hearts,
9 2304     He knows no more of mine than I of yours;
9 2305     Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.
9 2306     Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
9 2307   HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;
9 2308     But for his purpose in the coronation
9 2309     I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
9 2310     His gracious pleasure any way therein.
9 2311     But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;
9 2312     And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
9 2313     Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
9 2314 
9 2315                        Enter GLOUCESTER
9 2316 
9 2317   BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.
9 2318   GLOUCESTER. My noble lords and cousins an, good morrow.
9 2319     I have been long a sleeper, but I trust
9 2320     My absence doth neglect no great design
9 2321     Which by my presence might have been concluded.
9 2322   BUCKINGHAM. Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,
9 2323   WILLIAM Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part-
9 2324     I mean, your voice for crowning of the King.
9 2325   GLOUCESTER. Than my Lord Hastings no man might be
9 2326     bolder;
9 2327     His lordship knows me well and loves me well.
9 2328     My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn
9 2329     I saw good strawberries in your garden there.
9 2330     I do beseech you send for some of them.
9 2331   BISHOP of ELY. Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.
9 2332  Exit
9 2333   GLOUCESTER. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
9 2334                                                [Takes him aside]
9 2335     Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
9 2336     And finds the testy gentleman so hot
9 2337     That he will lose his head ere give consent
9 2338     His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,
9 2339     Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
9 2340   BUCKINGHAM. Withdraw yourself awhile; I'll go with you.
9 2341                                 Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
9 2342   DERBY. We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
9 2343     To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;
9 2344     For I myself am not so well provided
9 2345     As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
9 2346 
9 2347                     Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY
9 2348 
9 2349   BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?
9 2350     I have sent for these strawberries.
9 2351   HASTINGS. His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this
9 2352     morning;
9 2353     There's some conceit or other likes him well
9 2354     When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
9 2355     I think there's never a man in Christendom
9 2356     Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;
9 2357     For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
9 2358   DERBY. What of his heart perceive you in his face
9 2359     By any livelihood he show'd to-day?
9 2360   HASTINGS. Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
9 2361     For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
9 2362 
9 2363                Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
9 2364 
9 2365   GLOUCESTER. I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
9 2366     That do conspire my death with devilish plots
9 2367     Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
9 2368     Upon my body with their hellish charms?
9 2369   HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
9 2370     Makes me most forward in this princely presence
9 2371     To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be.
9 2372     I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
9 2373   GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
9 2374     Look how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm
9 2375     Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up.
9 2376     And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
9 2377     Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
9 2378     That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
9 2379   HASTINGS. If they have done this deed, my noble lord-
9 2380   GLOUCESTER. If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet,
9 2381     Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.
9 2382     Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear
9 2383     I will not dine until I see the same.
9 2384     Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done.
9 2385     The rest that love me, rise and follow me.
9 2386                     Exeunt all but HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIFF
9 2387   HASTINGS. Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me;
9 2388     For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
9 2389   STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms,
9 2390     And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.
9 2391     Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
9 2392     And started when he look'd upon the Tower,
9 2393     As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
9 2394     O, now I need the priest that spake to me!
9 2395     I now repent I told the pursuivant,
9 2396     As too triumphing, how mine enemies
9 2397     To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
9 2398     And I myself secure in grace and favour.
9 2399     O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
9 2400     Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
9 2401   RATCLIFF. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at
9 2402     dinner.
9 2403     Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
9 2404   HASTINGS. O momentary grace of mortal men,
9 2405     Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
9 2406     Who builds his hope in air of your good looks
9 2407     Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
9 2408     Ready with every nod to tumble down
9 2409     Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
9 2410   LOVEL. Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
9 2411   HASTINGS. O bloody Richard! Miserable England!
9 2412     I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee
9 2413     That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
9 2414     Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
9 2415     They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.           Exeunt
9 2416 
9 2417 
9 2418 
9 2419 
9 2420 SCENE 5.
9 2421 
9 2422 London. The Tower-walls
9 2423 
9 2424 Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten armour, marvellous
9 2425 ill-favoured
9 2426 
9 2427   GLOUCESTER. Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change
9 2428     thy colour,
9 2429     Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
9 2430     And then again begin, and stop again,
9 2431     As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?
9 2432   BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
9 2433     Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
9 2434     Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
9 2435     Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks
9 2436     Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
9 2437     And both are ready in their offices
9 2438     At any time to grace my stratagems.
9 2439     But what, is Catesby gone?
9 2440   GLOUCESTER. He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
9 2441 
9 2442                  Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY
9 2443 
9 2444   BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor-
9 2445   GLOUCESTER. Look to the drawbridge there!
9 2446   BUCKINGHAM. Hark! a drum.
9 2447   GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
9 2448   BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-
9 2449   GLOUCESTER. Look back, defend thee; here are enemies.
9 2450   BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!
9 2451 
9 2452            Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head
9 2453 
9 2454   GLOUCESTER. Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel.
9 2455   LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
9 2456     The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
9 2457   GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep.
9 2458     I took him for the plainest harmless creature
9 2459     That breath'd upon the earth a Christian;
9 2460     Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
9 2461     The history of all her secret thoughts.
9 2462     So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
9 2463     That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
9 2464     I mean his conversation with Shore's wife-
9 2465     He liv'd from all attainder of suspects.
9 2466   BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert'st shelt'red
9 2467     traitor
9 2468     That ever liv'd.
9 2469     Would you imagine, or almost believe-
9 2470     Were't not that by great preservation
9 2471     We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor
9 2472     This day had plotted, in the council-house,
9 2473     To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester.
9 2474   MAYOR. Had he done so?
9 2475   GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?
9 2476     Or that we would, against the form of law,
9 2477     Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death
9 2478     But that the extreme peril of the case,
9 2479     The peace of England and our persons' safety,
9 2480     Enforc'd us to this execution?
9 2481   MAYOR. Now, fair befall you! He deserv'd his death;
9 2482     And your good Graces both have well proceeded
9 2483     To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
9 2484     I never look'd for better at his hands
9 2485     After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
9 2486   BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die
9 2487     Until your lordship came to see his end-
9 2488     Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
9 2489     Something against our meanings, have prevented-
9 2490     Because, my lord, I would have had you heard
9 2491     The traitor speak, and timorously confess
9 2492     The manner and the purpose of his treasons:
9 2493     That you might well have signified the same
9 2494     Unto the citizens, who haply may
9 2495     Misconster us in him and wail his death.
9 2496   MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve
9 2497     As well as I had seen and heard him speak;
9 2498     And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,
9 2499     But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
9 2500     With all your just proceedings in this cause.
9 2501   GLOUCESTER. And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
9 2502     T' avoid the the the censures of the carping world.
9 2503   BUCKINGHAM. Which since you come too late of our intent,
9 2504     Yet witness what you hear we did intend.
9 2505     And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
9 2506                                                  Exit LORD MAYOR
9 2507   GLOUCESTER. Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
9 2508     The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post.
9 2509     There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
9 2510     Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
9 2511     Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
9 2512     Only for saying he would make his son
9 2513     Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,
9 2514     Which by the sign thereof was termed so.
9 2515     Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
9 2516     And bestial appetite in change of lust,
9 2517     Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,
9 2518     Even where his raging eye or savage heart
9 2519     Without control lusted to make a prey.
9 2520     Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
9 2521     Tell them, when that my mother went with child
9 2522     Of that insatiate Edward, noble York
9 2523     My princely father then had wars in France
9 2524     And, by true computation of the time,
9 2525     Found that the issue was not his begot;
9 2526     Which well appeared in his lineaments,
9 2527     Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.
9 2528     Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;
9 2529     Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.
9 2530   BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator
9 2531     As if the golden fee for which I plead
9 2532     Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.
9 2533   GLOUCESTER. If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's
9 2534     Castle;
9 2535     Where you shall find me well accompanied
9 2536     With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.
9 2537   BUCKINGHAM. I go; and towards three or four o'clock
9 2538     Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.           Exit
9 2539   GLOUCESTER. Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.
9 2540     [To CATESBY]  Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both
9 2541     Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
9 2542                                        Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
9 2543     Now will I go to take some privy order
9 2544     To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,
9 2545     And to give order that no manner person
9 2546     Have any time recourse unto the Princes.                Exit
9 2547 
9 2548 
9 2549 
9 2550 
9 2551 SCENE 6.
9 2552 
9 2553 London. A street
9 2554 
9 2555 Enter a SCRIVENER
9 2556 
9 2557   SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
9 2558     Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
9 2559     That it may be to-day read o'er in Paul's.
9 2560     And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
9 2561     Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,
9 2562     For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;
9 2563     The precedent was full as long a-doing;
9 2564     And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,
9 2565     Untainted, unexamin'd, free, at liberty.
9 2566     Here's a good world the while! Who is so gros
9 2567     That cannot see this palpable device?
9 2568     Yet who's so bold but says he sees it not?
9 2569     Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
9 2570     When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.          Exit
9 2571 
9 2572 
9 2573 
9 2574 
9 2575 SCENE 7.
9 2576 
9 2577 London. Baynard's Castle
9 2578 
9 2579 Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors
9 2580 
9 2581   GLOUCESTER. How now, how now! What say the citizens?
9 2582   BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord,
9 2583     The citizens are mum, say not a word.
9 2584   GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's
9 2585     children?
9 2586   BUCKINGHAM. I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
9 2587     And his contract by deputy in France;
9 2588     Th' insatiate greediness of his desire,
9 2589     And his enforcement of the city wives;
9 2590     His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
9 2591     As being got, your father then in France,
9 2592     And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.
9 2593     Withal I did infer your lineaments,
9 2594     Being the right idea of your father,
9 2595     Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
9 2596     Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
9 2597     Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
9 2598     Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
9 2599     Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
9 2600     Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse.
9 2601     And when mine oratory drew toward end
9 2602     I bid them that did love their country's good
9 2603     Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal King!'
9 2604   GLOUCESTER. And did they so?
9 2605   BUCKINGHAM. No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
9 2606     But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
9 2607     Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
9 2608     Which when I saw, I reprehended them,
9 2609     And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence.
9 2610     His answer was, the people were not used
9 2611     To be spoke to but by the Recorder.
9 2612     Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again.
9 2613     'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-
9 2614     But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
9 2615     When he had done, some followers of mine own
9 2616     At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps,
9 2617     And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
9 2618     And thus I took the vantage of those few-
9 2619     'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I
9 2620     'This general applause and cheerful shout
9 2621     Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.'
9 2622     And even here brake off and came away.
9 2623   GLOUCESTER. What, tongueless blocks were they? Would
9 2624     they not speak?
9 2625     Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?
9 2626   BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;
9 2627     Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit;
9 2628     And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
9 2629     And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;
9 2630     For on that ground I'll make a holy descant;
9 2631     And be not easily won to our requests.
9 2632     Play the maid's part: still answer nay, and take it.
9 2633   GLOUCESTER. I go; and if you plead as well for them
9 2634     As I can say nay to thee for myself,
9 2635     No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.
9 2636   BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor
9 2637     knocks.                                      Exit GLOUCESTER
9 2638 
9 2639            Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and citizens
9 2640 
9 2641     Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here;
9 2642     I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.
9 2643 
9 2644                          Enter CATESBY
9 2645 
9 2646     Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?
9 2647   CATESBY. He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,
9 2648     To visit him to-morrow or next day.
9 2649     He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
9 2650     Divinely bent to meditation;
9 2651     And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd,
9 2652     To draw him from his holy exercise.
9 2653   BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke;
9 2654     Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen,
9 2655     In deep designs, in matter of great moment,
9 2656     No less importing than our general good,
9 2657     Are come to have some conference with his Grace.
9 2658   CATESBY. I'll signify so much unto him straight.          Exit
9 2659   BUCKINGHAM. Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
9 2660     He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,
9 2661     But on his knees at meditation;
9 2662     Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
9 2663     But meditating with two deep divines;
9 2664     Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
9 2665     But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
9 2666     Happy were England would this virtuous prince
9 2667     Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof;
9 2668     But, sure, I fear we shall not win him to it.
9 2669   MAYOR. Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!
9 2670   BUCKINGHAM. I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.
9 2671 
9 2672                           Re-enter CATESBY
9 2673 
9 2674     Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?
9 2675   CATESBY. My lord,
9 2676     He wonders to what end you have assembled
9 2677     Such troops of citizens to come to him.
9 2678     His Grace not being warn'd thereof before,
9 2679     He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.
9 2680   BUCKINGHAM. Sorry I am my noble cousin should
9 2681     Suspect me that I mean no good to him.
9 2682     By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;
9 2683     And so once more return and tell his Grace.
9 2684                                                     Exit CATESBY
9 2685     When holy and devout religious men
9 2686     Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence,
9 2687     So sweet is zealous contemplation.
9 2688 
9 2689            Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two BISHOPS.
9 2690                       CATESBY returns
9 2691 
9 2692   MAYOR. See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen!
9 2693   BUCKINGHAM. Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
9 2694     To stay him from the fall of vanity;
9 2695     And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
9 2696     True ornaments to know a holy man.
9 2697     Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince,
9 2698     Lend favourable ear to our requests,
9 2699     And pardon us the interruption
9 2700     Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
9 2701   GLOUCESTER. My lord, there needs no such apology:
9 2702     I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
9 2703     Who, earnest in the service of my God,
9 2704     Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.
9 2705     But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?
9 2706   BUCKINGHAM. Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
9 2707     And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
9 2708   GLOUCESTER. I do suspect I have done some offence
9 2709     That seems disgracious in the city's eye,
9 2710     And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
9 2711   BUCKINGHAM. You have, my lord. Would it might please
9 2712     your Grace,
9 2713     On our entreaties, to amend your fault!
9 2714   GLOUCESTER. Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
9 2715   BUCKINGHAM. Know then, it is your fault that you resign
9 2716     The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
9 2717     The scept'red office of your ancestors,
9 2718     Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
9 2719     The lineal glory of your royal house,
9 2720     To the corruption of a blemish'd stock;
9 2721     Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
9 2722     Which here we waken to our country's good,
9 2723     The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
9 2724     Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,
9 2725     Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
9 2726     And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf
9 2727     Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.
9 2728     Which to recure, we heartily solicit
9 2729     Your gracious self to take on you the charge
9 2730     And kingly government of this your land-
9 2731     Not as protector, steward, substitute,
9 2732     Or lowly factor for another's gain;
9 2733     But as successively, from blood to blood,
9 2734     Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
9 2735     For this, consorted with the citizens,
9 2736     Your very worshipful and loving friends,
9 2737     And by their vehement instigation,
9 2738     In this just cause come I to move your Grace.
9 2739   GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell if to depart in silence
9 2740     Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
9 2741     Best fitteth my degree or your condition.
9 2742     If not to answer, you might haply think
9 2743     Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
9 2744     To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
9 2745     Which fondly you would here impose on me;
9 2746     If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
9 2747     So season'd with your faithful love to me,
9 2748     Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.
9 2749     Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first,
9 2750     And then, in speaking, not to incur the last-
9 2751     Definitively thus I answer you:
9 2752     Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert
9 2753     Unmeritable shuns your high request.
9 2754     First, if all obstacles were cut away,
9 2755     And that my path were even to the crown,
9 2756     As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
9 2757     Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
9 2758     So mighty and so many my defects,
9 2759     That I would rather hide me from my greatness-
9 2760     Being a bark to brook no mighty sea-
9 2761     Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
9 2762     And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
9 2763     But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me-
9 2764     And much I need to help you, were there need.
9 2765     The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
9 2766     Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
9 2767     Will well become the seat of majesty
9 2768     And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
9 2769     On him I lay that you would lay on me-
9 2770     The right and fortune of his happy stars,
9 2771     Which God defend that I should wring from him.
9 2772   BUCKINGHAM. My lord, this argues conscience in your
9 2773     Grace;
9 2774     But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
9 2775     All circumstances well considered.
9 2776     You say that Edward is your brother's son.
9 2777     So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
9 2778     For first was he contract to Lady Lucy-
9 2779     Your mother lives a witness to his vow-
9 2780     And afterward by substitute betroth'd
9 2781     To Bona, sister to the King of France.
9 2782     These both put off, a poor petitioner,
9 2783     A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
9 2784     A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
9 2785     Even in the afternoon of her best days,
9 2786     Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,
9 2787     Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree
9 2788     To base declension and loath'd bigamy.
9 2789     By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
9 2790     This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.
9 2791     More bitterly could I expostulate,
9 2792     Save that, for reverence to some alive,
9 2793     I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
9 2794     Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
9 2795     This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
9 2796     If not to bless us and the land withal,
9 2797     Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
9 2798     From the corruption of abusing times
9 2799     Unto a lineal true-derived course.
9 2800   MAYOR. Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.
9 2801   BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
9 2802   CATESBY. O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
9 2803   GLOUCESTER. Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
9 2804     I am unfit for state and majesty.
9 2805     I do beseech you, take it not amiss:
9 2806     I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
9 2807   BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal,
9 2808     Loath to depose the child, your brother's son;
9 2809     As well we know your tenderness of heart
9 2810     And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
9 2811     Which we have noted in you to your kindred
9 2812     And egally indeed to all estates-
9 2813     Yet know, whe'er you accept our suit or no,
9 2814     Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
9 2815     But we will plant some other in the throne
9 2816     To the disgrace and downfall of your house;
9 2817     And in this resolution here we leave you.
9 2818     Come, citizens. Zounds, I'll entreat no more.
9 2819   GLOUCESTER. O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
9 2820                           Exeunt BUCKINGHAM, MAYOR, and citizens
9 2821   CATESBY. Call him again, sweet Prince, accept their suit.
9 2822     If you deny them, all the land will rue it.
9 2823   GLOUCESTER. Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
9 2824     Call them again. I am not made of stones,
9 2825     But penetrable to your kind entreaties,
9 2826     Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
9 2827 
9 2828                   Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest
9 2829 
9 2830     Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,
9 2831     Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
9 2832     To bear her burden, whe'er I will or no,
9 2833     I must have patience to endure the load;
9 2834     But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach
9 2835     Attend the sequel of your imposition,
9 2836     Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
9 2837     From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
9 2838     For God doth know, and you may partly see,
9 2839     How far I am from the desire of this.
9 2840   MAYOR. God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.
9 2841   GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
9 2842   BUCKINGHAM. Then I salute you with this royal title-
9 2843     Long live King Richard, England's worthy King!
9 2844   ALL. Amen.
9 2845   BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow may it please you to be crown'd?
9 2846   GLOUCESTER. Even when you please, for you will have it so.
9 2847   BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace;
9 2848     And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.
9 2849   GLOUCESTER.  [To the BISHOPS]  Come, let us to our holy
9 2850     work again.
9 2851     Farewell, my cousin; farewell, gentle friends.        Exeunt
9 2852

9 2867 ACT IV. SCENE 1.
9 2868 
9 2869 London. Before the Tower
9 2870 
9 2871 Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS of YORK, and MARQUIS of DORSET, at
9 2872 one door;
9 2873 ANNE, DUCHESS of GLOUCESTER, leading LADY MARGARET PLANTAGENET,
9 2874 CLARENCE's young daughter, at another door
9 2875 
9 2876   DUCHESS. Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet,
9 2877     Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
9 2878     Now, for my life, she's wand'ring to the Tower,
9 2879     On pure heart's love, to greet the tender Princes.
9 2880     Daughter, well met.
9 2881   ANNE. God give your Graces both
9 2882     A happy and a joyful time of day!
9 2883   QUEEN ELIZABETH. As much to you, good sister! Whither
9 2884     away?
9 2885   ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
9 2886     Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
9 2887     To gratulate the gentle Princes there.
9 2888   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Kind sister, thanks; we'll enter
9 2889     all together.
9 2890 
9 2891                        Enter BRAKENBURY
9 2892 
9 2893     And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
9 2894     Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
9 2895     How doth the Prince, and my young son of York?
9 2896   BRAKENBURY. Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
9 2897     I may not suffer you to visit them.
9 2898     The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary.
9 2899   QUEEN ELIZABETH. The King! Who's that?
9 2900   BRAKENBURY. I mean the Lord Protector.
9 2901   QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Lord protect him from that kingly
9 2902     title!
9 2903     Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
9 2904     I am their mother; who shall bar me from them?
9 2905   DUCHESS. I am their father's mother; I will see them.
9 2906   ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
9 2907     Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,
9 2908     And take thy office from thee on my peril.
9 2909   BRAKENBURY. No, madam, no. I may not leave it so;
9 2910     I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.            Exit
9 2911 
9 2912                          Enter STANLEY
9 2913 
9 2914   STANLEY. Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
9 2915     And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother
9 2916     And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
9 2917     [To ANNE]  Come, madam, you must straight to
9 2918     Westminster,
9 2919     There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
9 2920   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, cut my lace asunder
9 2921     That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,
9 2922     Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!
9 2923   ANNE. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
9 2924   DORSET. Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace?
9 2925   QUEEN ELIZABETH. O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee
9 2926     gone!
9 2927     Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;
9 2928     Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
9 2929     If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
9 2930     And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.
9 2931     Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
9 2932     Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
9 2933     And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
9 2934     Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
9 2935   STANLEY. Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
9 2936     Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
9 2937     You shall have letters from me to my son
9 2938     In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
9 2939     Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
9 2940   DUCHESS. O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
9 2941     O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
9 2942     A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
9 2943     Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
9 2944   STANLEY. Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
9 2945   ANNE. And I with all unwillingness will go.
9 2946     O, would to God that the inclusive verge
9 2947     Of golden metal that must round my brow
9 2948     Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains!
9 2949     Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
9 2950     And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen!'
9 2951   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Go, go, poor soul; I envy not thy glory.
9 2952     To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
9 2953   ANNE. No, why? When he that is my husband now
9 2954     Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse;
9 2955     When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
9 2956     Which issued from my other angel husband,
9 2957     And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd-
9 2958     O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
9 2959     This was my wish: 'Be thou' quoth I 'accurs'd
9 2960     For making me, so young, so old a widow;
9 2961     And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
9 2962     And be thy wife, if any be so mad,
9 2963     More miserable by the life of thee
9 2964     Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.'
9 2965     Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
9 2966     Within so small a time, my woman's heart
9 2967     Grossly grew captive to his honey words
9 2968     And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse,
9 2969     Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;
9 2970     For never yet one hour in his bed
9 2971     Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
9 2972     But with his timorous dreams was still awak'd.
9 2973     Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
9 2974     And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
9 2975   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
9 2976   ANNE. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.
9 2977   DORSET. Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!
9 2978   ANNE. Adieu, poor soul, that tak'st thy leave of it!
9 2979   DUCHESS.  [To DORSET]  Go thou to Richmond, and good
9 2980     fortune guide thee!
9 2981     [To ANNE]  Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend
9 2982     thee!  [To QUEEN ELIZABETH]  Go thou to sanctuary, and good
9 2983     thoughts possess thee!
9 2984     I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
9 2985     Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
9 2986     And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.
9 2987   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Stay, yet look back with me unto the
9 2988     Tower.
9 2989     Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
9 2990     Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls,
9 2991     Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
9 2992     Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
9 2993     For tender princes, use my babies well.
9 2994     So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.         Exeunt

9 2999 SCENE 2.
9 3000 
9 3001 London. The palace
9 3002 
9 3003 Sound a sennet. Enter RICHARD, in pomp, as KING; BUCKINGHAM,
9 3004 CATESBY,
9 3005 RATCLIFF, LOVEL, a PAGE, and others
9 3006 
9 3007   KING RICHARD. Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham!
9 3008   BUCKINGHAM. My gracious sovereign?
9 3009   KING RICHARD. Give me thy hand.
9 3010                            [Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound]
9 3011     Thus high, by thy advice
9 3012     And thy assistance, is King Richard seated.
9 3013     But shall we wear these glories for a day;
9 3014     Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
9 3015   BUCKINGHAM. Still live they, and for ever let them last!
9 3016   KING RICHARD. Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
9 3017     To try if thou be current gold indeed.
9 3018     Young Edward lives-think now what I would speak.
9 3019   BUCKINGHAM. Say on, my loving lord.
9 3020   KING RICHARD. Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King.
9 3021   BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.
9 3022   KING RICHARD. Ha! am I King? 'Tis so; but Edward lives.
9 3023   BUCKINGHAM. True, noble Prince.
9 3024   KING RICHARD. O bitter consequence:
9 3025     That Edward still should live-true noble Prince!
9 3026     Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.
9 3027     Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead.
9 3028     And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
9 3029     What say'st thou now? Speak suddenly, be brief.
9 3030   BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace may do your pleasure.
9 3031   KING RICHARD. Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.
9 3032     Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
9 3033   BUCKINGHAM. Give me some little breath, some pause,
9 3034     dear Lord,
9 3035     Before I positively speak in this.
9 3036     I will resolve you herein presently.                    Exit
9 3037   CATESBY.  [Aside to another]  The King is angry; see, he
9 3038     gnaws his lip.
9 3039   KING RICHARD. I will converse with iron-witted fools
9 3040                                       [Descends from the throne]
9 3041     And unrespective boys; none are for me
9 3042     That look into me with considerate eyes.
9 3043     High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
9 3044     Boy!
9 3045   PAGE. My lord?
9 3046   KING RICHARD. Know'st thou not any whom corrupting
9 3047     gold
9 3048     Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
9 3049   PAGE. I know a discontented gentleman
9 3050     Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
9 3051     Gold were as good as twenty orators,
9 3052     And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.
9 3053   KING RICHARD. What is his name?
9 3054   PAGE. His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
9 3055   KING RICHARD. I partly know the man. Go, call him hither,
9 3056     boy.                                               Exit PAGE
9 3057     The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
9 3058     No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels.
9 3059     Hath he so long held out with me, untir'd,
9 3060     And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.
9 3061 
9 3062                             Enter STANLEY
9 3063 
9 3064     How now, Lord Stanley! What's the news?
9 3065   STANLEY. Know, my loving lord,
9 3066     The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled
9 3067     To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.    [Stands apart]
9 3068   KING RICHARD. Come hither, Catesby. Rumour it abroad
9 3069     That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;
9 3070     I will take order for her keeping close.
9 3071     Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
9 3072     Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter-
9 3073     The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
9 3074     Look how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
9 3075     That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.
9 3076     About it; for it stands me much upon
9 3077     To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
9 3078                                                     Exit CATESBY
9 3079     I must be married to my brother's daughter,
9 3080     Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
9 3081     Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
9 3082     Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
9 3083     So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
9 3084     Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
9 3085 
9 3086                      Re-enter PAGE, with TYRREL
9 3087 
9 3088     Is thy name Tyrrel?
9 3089   TYRREL. James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
9 3090   KING RICHARD. Art thou, indeed?
9 3091   TYRREL. Prove me, my gracious lord.
9 3092   KING RICHARD. Dar'st'thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
9 3093   TYRREL. Please you;
9 3094     But I had rather kill two enemies.
9 3095   KING RICHARD. Why, then thou hast it. Two deep enemies,
9 3096     Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers,
9 3097     Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
9 3098   TYRREL, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
9 3099   TYRREL. Let me have open means to come to them,
9 3100     And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
9 3101   KING RICHARD. Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come
9 3102     hither, Tyrrel.
9 3103     Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.      [Whispers]
9 3104     There is no more but so: say it is done,
9 3105     And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.
9 3106   TYRREL. I will dispatch it straight.                      Exit
9 3107 
9 3108                     Re-enter BUCKINGHAM
9 3109 
9 3110     BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I have consider'd in my mind
9 3111     The late request that you did sound me in.
9 3112   KING RICHARD. Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to
9 3113     Richmond.
9 3114   BUCKINGHAM. I hear the news, my lord.
9 3115   KING RICHARD. Stanley, he is your wife's son: well, look
9 3116     unto it.
9 3117   BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,
9 3118     For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd:
9 3119     Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables
9 3120     Which you have promised I shall possess.
9 3121   KING RICHARD. Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
9 3122     Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
9 3123   BUCKINGHAM. What says your Highness to my just request?
9 3124   KING RICHARD. I do remember me: Henry the Sixth
9 3125     Did prophesy that Richmond should be King,
9 3126     When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
9 3127     A king!-perhaps-
9 3128   BUCKINGHAM. My lord-
9 3129   KING RICHARD. How chance the prophet could not at that
9 3130     time
9 3131     Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
9 3132   BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom-
9 3133   KING RICHARD. Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
9 3134     The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle
9 3135     And call'd it Rugemount, at which name I started,
9 3136     Because a bard of Ireland told me once
9 3137     I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
9 3138   BUCKINGHAM. My lord-
9 3139   KING RICHARD. Ay, what's o'clock?
9 3140   BUCKINGHAM. I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind
9 3141     Of what you promis'd me.
9 3142   KING RICHARD. Well, but o'clock?
9 3143   BUCKINGHAM. Upon the stroke of ten.
9 3144   KING RICHARD. Well, let it strike.
9 3145   BUCKINGHAM. Why let it strike?
9 3146   KING RICHARD. Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the
9 3147     stroke
9 3148     Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
9 3149     I am not in the giving vein to-day.
9 3150   BUCKINGHAM. May it please you to resolve me in my suit.
9 3151   KING RICHARD. Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
9 3152                                        Exeunt all but Buckingham
9 3153   BUCKINGHAM. And is it thus? Repays he my deep service
9 3154     With such contempt? Made I him King for this?
9 3155     O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
9 3156     To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!               Exit
9 3157 
9 3158 
9 3159 
9 3160 
9 3161 SCENE 3.
9 3162 
9 3163 London. The palace
9 3164 
9 3165 Enter TYRREL
9 3166 
9 3167   TYRREL. The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
9 3168     The most arch deed of piteous massacre
9 3169     That ever yet this land was guilty of.
9 3170     Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn
9 3171     To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
9 3172     Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
9 3173     Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,
9 3174     Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.
9 3175     'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'-
9 3176     'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
9 3177     Within their alabaster innocent arms.
9 3178     Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
9 3179     And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
9 3180     A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
9 3181     Which once,' quoth Forrest 'almost chang'd my mind;
9 3182     But, O, the devil'-there the villain stopp'd;
9 3183     When Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
9 3184     The most replenished sweet work of nature
9 3185     That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
9 3186     Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
9 3187     They could not speak; and so I left them both,
9 3188     To bear this tidings to the bloody King.
9 3189 
9 3190                         Enter KING RICHARD
9 3191 
9 3192     And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord!
9 3193   KING RICHARD. Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
9 3194   TYRREL. If to have done the thing you gave in charge
9 3195     Beget your happiness, be happy then,
9 3196     For it is done.
9 3197   KING RICHARD. But didst thou see them dead?
9 3198   TYRREL. I did, my lord.
9 3199   KING RICHARD. And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
9 3200   TYRREL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
9 3201     But where, to say the truth, I do not know.
9 3202   KING RICHARD. Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
9 3203     When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
9 3204     Meantime, but think how I may do thee good
9 3205     And be inheritor of thy desire.
9 3206     Farewell till then.
9 3207   TYRREL. I humbly take my leave.                           Exit
9 3208   KING RICHARD. The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
9 3209     His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
9 3210     The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
9 3211     And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night.
9 3212     Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims
9 3213     At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
9 3214     And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,
9 3215     To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.
9 3216 
9 3217                            Enter RATCLIFF
9 3218 
9 3219   RATCLIFF. My lord!
9 3220   KING RICHARD. Good or bad news, that thou com'st in so
9 3221     bluntly?
9 3222   RATCLIFF. Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond;
9 3223     And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
9 3224     Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
9 3225   KING RICHARD. Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
9 3226     Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.
9 3227     Come, I have learn'd that fearful commenting
9 3228     Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
9 3229     Delay leads impotent and snail-pac'd beggary.
9 3230     Then fiery expedition be my wing,
9 3231     Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
9 3232     Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield.
9 3233     We must be brief when traitors brave the field.       Exeunt

9 3240 London. Before the palace
9 3241 
9 3242 Enter old QUEEN MARGARET
9 3243 
9 3244   QUEEN MARGARET. So now prosperity begins to mellow
9 3245     And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
9 3246     Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd
9 3247     To watch the waning of mine enemies.
9 3248     A dire induction am I witness to,
9 3249     And will to France, hoping the consequence
9 3250     Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
9 3251     Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?
9 3252                                                        [Retires]
9 3253 
9 3254            Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK
9 3255 
9 3256   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, my poor princes! ah, my tender
9 3257     babes!
9 3258     My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
9 3259     If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
9 3260     And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
9 3261     Hover about me with your airy wings
9 3262     And hear your mother's lamentation.
9 3263   QUEEN MARGARET. Hover about her; say that right for right
9 3264     Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
9 3265   DUCHESS. So many miseries have craz'd my voice
9 3266     That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
9 3267     Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
9 3268   QUEEN MARGARET. Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet,
9 3269     Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
9 3270   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle
9 3271     lambs
9 3272     And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
9 3273     When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
9 3274   QUEEN MARGARET. When holy Harry died, and my sweet
9 3275     son.
9 3276   DUCHESS. Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,
9 3277     Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
9 3278     Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
9 3279     Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,    [Sitting down]
9 3280     Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.
9 3281   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a
9 3282     grave
9 3283     As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
9 3284     Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
9 3285     Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?
9 3286                                            [Sitting down by her]
9 3287   QUEEN MARGARET.  [Coming forward]  If ancient sorrow be
9 3288     most reverend,
9 3289     Give mine the benefit of seniory,
9 3290     And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.
9 3291     If sorrow can admit society,        [Sitting down with them]
9 3292     Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine.
9 3293     I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
9 3294     I had a husband, till a Richard kill'd him:
9 3295     Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
9 3296     Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.
9 3297   DUCHESS. I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
9 3298     I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
9 3299   QUEEN MARGARET. Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard
9 3300     kill'd him.
9 3301     From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
9 3302     A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
9 3303     That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes
9 3304     To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
9 3305     That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
9 3306     That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
9 3307     That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
9 3308     Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.
9 3309     O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
9 3310     How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
9 3311     Preys on the issue of his mother's body
9 3312     And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
9 3313   DUCHESS. O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
9 3314     God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
9 3315   QUEEN MARGARET. Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
9 3316     And now I cloy me with beholding it.
9 3317     Thy Edward he is dead, that kill'd my Edward;
9 3318     The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
9 3319     Young York he is but boot, because both they
9 3320     Match'd not the high perfection of my loss.
9 3321     Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward;
9 3322     And the beholders of this frantic play,
9 3323     Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
9 3324     Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
9 3325     Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer;
9 3326     Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls
9 3327     And send them thither. But at hand, at hand,
9 3328     Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.
9 3329     Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
9 3330     To have him suddenly convey'd from hence.
9 3331     Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,
9 3332     That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.'
9 3333   QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, thou didst prophesy the time would
9 3334       come
9 3335     That I should wish for thee to help me curse
9 3336     That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
9 3337   QUEEN MARGARET. I Call'd thee then vain flourish of my
9 3338       fortune;
9 3339     I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen,
9 3340     The presentation of but what I was,
9 3341     The flattering index of a direful pageant,
9 3342     One heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below,
9 3343     A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
9 3344     A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
9 3345     To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
9 3346     A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
9 3347     A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
9 3348     Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?
9 3349     Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?
9 3350     Who sues, and kneels, and says 'God save the Queen'?
9 3351     Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?
9 3352     Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?
9 3353     Decline an this, and see what now thou art:
9 3354     For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
9 3355     For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
9 3356     For one being su'd to, one that humbly sues;
9 3357     For Queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
9 3358     For she that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
9 3359     For she being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
9 3360     For she commanding all, obey'd of none.
9 3361     Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about
9 3362     And left thee but a very prey to time,
9 3363     Having no more but thought of what thou wast
9 3364     To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
9 3365     Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
9 3366     Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
9 3367     Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke,
9 3368     From which even here I slip my weary head
9 3369     And leave the burden of it all on thee.
9 3370     Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance;
9 3371     These English woes shall make me smile in France.
9 3372   QUEEN ELIZABETH. O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile
9 3373     And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
9 3374   QUEEN MARGARET. Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the
9 3375       days;
9 3376     Compare dead happiness with living woe;
9 3377     Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,
9 3378     And he that slew them fouler than he is.
9 3379     Bett'ring thy loss makes the bad-causer worse;
9 3380     Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
9 3381   QUEEN ELIZABETH. My words are dull; O, quicken them
9 3382     with thine!
9 3383   QUEEN MARGARET. Thy woes will make them sharp and
9 3384     pierce like mine.                                       Exit
9 3385   DUCHESS. Why should calamity be fun of words?
9 3386   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Windy attorneys to their client woes,
9 3387     Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
9 3388     Poor breathing orators of miseries,
9 3389     Let them have scope; though what they will impart
9 3390     Help nothing else, yet do they case the heart.
9 3391   DUCHESS. If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me,
9 3392     And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
9 3393     My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd.
9 3394     The trumpet sounds; be copious in exclaims.
9 3395 
9 3396          Enter KING RICHARD and his train, marching with
9 3397                      drums and trumpets
9 3398 
9 3399   KING RICHARD. Who intercepts me in my expedition?
9 3400   DUCHESS. O, she that might have intercepted thee,
9 3401     By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
9 3402     From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
9 3403   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Hidest thou that forehead with a golden
9 3404     crown
9 3405     Where't should be branded, if that right were right,
9 3406     The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown,
9 3407     And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
9 3408     Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
9 3409   DUCHESS. Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother
9 3410     Clarence?
9 3411     And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
9 3412   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan,
9 3413     Grey?
9 3414   DUCHESS. Where is kind Hastings?
9 3415   KING RICHARD. A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!
9 3416     Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
9 3417     Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say!
9 3418                                              [Flourish. Alarums]
9 3419     Either be patient and entreat me fair,
9 3420     Or with the clamorous report of war
9 3421     Thus will I drown your exclamations.
9 3422   DUCHESS. Art thou my son?
9 3423   KING RICHARD. Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
9 3424   DUCHESS. Then patiently hear my impatience.
9 3425   KING RICHARD. Madam, I have a touch of your condition
9 3426     That cannot brook the accent of reproof.
9 3427   DUCHESS. O, let me speak!
9 3428   KING RICHARD. Do, then; but I'll not hear.
9 3429   DUCHESS. I will be mild and gentle in my words.
9 3430   KING RICHARD. And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
9 3431   DUCHESS. Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
9 3432     God knows, in torment and in agony.
9 3433   KING RICHARD. And came I not at last to comfort you?
9 3434   DUCHESS. No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well
9 3435     Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell.
9 3436     A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
9 3437     Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
9 3438     Thy school-days frightful, desp'rate, wild, and furious;
9 3439     Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;
9 3440     Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,
9 3441     More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred.
9 3442     What comfortable hour canst thou name
9 3443     That ever grac'd me with thy company?
9 3444   KING RICHARD. Faith, none but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
9 3445     your Grace
9 3446     To breakfast once forth of my company.
9 3447     If I be so disgracious in your eye,
9 3448     Let me march on and not offend you, madam.
9 3449     Strike up the drum.
9 3450   DUCHESS. I prithee hear me speak.
9 3451   KING RICHARD. You speak too bitterly.
9 3452   DUCHESS. Hear me a word;
9 3453     For I shall never speak to thee again.
9 3454   KING RICHARD. So.
9 3455   DUCHESS. Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance
9 3456     Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror;
9 3457     Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
9 3458     And never more behold thy face again.
9 3459     Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,
9 3460     Which in the day of battle tire thee more
9 3461     Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
9 3462     My prayers on the adverse party fight;
9 3463     And there the little souls of Edward's children
9 3464     Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
9 3465     And promise them success and victory.
9 3466     Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.
9 3467     Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.        Exit
9 3468   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Though far more cause, yet much less
9 3469       spirit to curse
9 3470     Abides in me; I say amen to her.
9 3471   KING RICHARD. Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.
9 3472   QUEEN ELIZABETH. I have no moe sons of the royal blood
9 3473     For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,
9 3474     They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
9 3475     And therefore level not to hit their lives.
9 3476   KING RICHARD. You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth.
9 3477     Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
9 3478   QUEEN ELIZABETH. And must she die for this? O, let her
9 3479       live,
9 3480     And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,
9 3481     Slander myself as false to Edward's bed,
9 3482     Throw over her the veil of infamy;
9 3483     So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
9 3484     I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
9 3485   KING RICHARD. Wrong not her birth; she is a royal
9 3486     Princess.
9 3487   QUEEN ELIZABETH. To save her life I'll say she is not so.
9 3488   KING RICHARD. Her life is safest only in her birth.
9 3489   QUEEN ELIZABETH. And only in that safety died her
9 3490       brothers.
9 3491   KING RICHARD. Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite.
9 3492   QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, to their lives ill friends were
9 3493       contrary.
9 3494   KING RICHARD. All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
9 3495   QUEEN ELIZABETH. True, when avoided grace makes destiny.
9 3496     My babes were destin'd to a fairer death,
9 3497     If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
9 3498   KING RICHARD. You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
9 3499   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle
9 3500       cozen'd
9 3501     Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
9 3502     Whose hand soever lanc'd their tender hearts,
9 3503     Thy head, an indirectly, gave direction.
9 3504     No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt
9 3505     Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart
9 3506     To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
9 3507     But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame,
9 3508     My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
9 3509     Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
9 3510     And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death,
9 3511     Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
9 3512     Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
9 3513   KING RICHARD. Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
9 3514     And dangerous success of bloody wars,
9 3515     As I intend more good to you and yours
9 3516     Than ever you or yours by me were harm'd!
9 3517   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What good is cover'd with the face of
9 3518       heaven,
9 3519     To be discover'd, that can do me good?
9 3520   KING RICHARD. advancement of your children, gentle
9 3521     lady.
9 3522   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Up to some scaffold, there to lose their
9 3523     heads?
9 3524   KING RICHARD. Unto the dignity and height of Fortune,
9 3525     The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
9 3526   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Flatter my sorrow with report of it;
9 3527     Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
9 3528     Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
9 3529   KING RICHARD. Even all I have-ay, and myself and all
9 3530     Will I withal endow a child of thine;
9 3531     So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
9 3532     Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
9 3533     Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
9 3534   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Be brief, lest that the process of thy
9 3535       kindness
9 3536     Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
9 3537   KING RICHARD. Then know, that from my soul I love thy
9 3538     daughter.
9 3539   QUEEN ELIZABETH. My daughter's mother thinks it with her
9 3540     soul.
9 3541   KING RICHARD. What do you think?
9 3542   QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou dost love my daughter from
9 3543       thy soul.
9 3544     So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,
9 3545     And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
9 3546   KING RICHARD. Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
9 3547     I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
9 3548     And do intend to make her Queen of England.
9 3549   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be
9 3550     her king?
9 3551   KING RICHARD. Even he that makes her Queen. Who else
9 3552     should be?
9 3553   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What, thou?
9 3554   KING RICHARD. Even so. How think you of it?
9 3555   QUEEN ELIZABETH. How canst thou woo her?
9 3556   KING RICHARD. That would I learn of you,
9 3557     As one being best acquainted with her humour.
9 3558   QUEEN ELIZABETH. And wilt thou learn of me?
9 3559   KING RICHARD. Madam, with all my heart.
9 3560   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her
9 3561     brothers,
9 3562     A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
9 3563     'Edward' and 'York.' Then haply will she weep;
9 3564     Therefore present to her-as sometimes Margaret
9 3565     Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood-
9 3566     A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
9 3567     The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,
9 3568     And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.
9 3569     If this inducement move her not to love,
9 3570     Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;
9 3571     Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,
9 3572     Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake
9 3573     Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
9 3574   KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way
9 3575     To win your daughter.
9 3576   QUEEN ELIZABETH. There is no other way;
9 3577     Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
9 3578     And not be Richard that hath done all this.
9 3579   KING RICHARD. Say that I did all this for love of her.
9 3580   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but
9 3581       hate thee,
9 3582     Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
9 3583   KING RICHARD. Look what is done cannot be now amended.
9 3584     Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
9 3585     Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.
9 3586     If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
9 3587     To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.
9 3588     If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
9 3589     To quicken your increase I will beget
9 3590     Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.
9 3591     A grandam's name is little less in love
9 3592     Than is the doating title of a mother;
9 3593     They are as children but one step below,
9 3594     Even of your metal, of your very blood;
9 3595     Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
9 3596     Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
9 3597     Your children were vexation to your youth;
9 3598     But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
9 3599     The loss you have is but a son being King,
9 3600     And by that loss your daughter is made Queen.
9 3601     I cannot make you what amends I would,
9 3602     Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
9 3603     Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
9 3604     Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
9 3605     This fair alliance quickly shall can home
9 3606     To high promotions and great dignity.
9 3607     The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
9 3608     Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
9 3609     Again shall you be mother to a king,
9 3610     And all the ruins of distressful times
9 3611     Repair'd with double riches of content.
9 3612     What! we have many goodly days to see.
9 3613     The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
9 3614     Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
9 3615     Advantaging their loan with interest
9 3616     Of ten times double gain of happiness.
9 3617     Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;
9 3618     Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
9 3619     Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
9 3620     Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame
9 3621     Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes
9 3622     With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.
9 3623     And when this arm of mine hath chastised
9 3624     The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
9 3625     Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,
9 3626     And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
9 3627     To whom I will retail my conquest won,
9 3628     And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar's Caesar.
9 3629   QUEEN ELIZABETH. What were I best to say? Her father's
9 3630       brother
9 3631     Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?
9 3632     Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
9 3633     Under what title shall I woo for thee
9 3634     That God, the law, my honour, and her love
9 3635     Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
9 3636   KING RICHARD. Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
9 3637   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Which she shall purchase with
9 3638     still-lasting war.
9 3639   KING RICHARD. Tell her the King, that may command,
9 3640     entreats.
9 3641   QUEEN ELIZABETH. That at her hands which the King's
9 3642     King forbids.
9 3643   KING RICHARD. Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
9 3644   QUEEN ELIZABETH. To wail the title, as her mother doth.
9 3645   KING RICHARD. Say I will love her everlastingly.
9 3646   QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
9 3647   KING RICHARD. Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
9 3648   QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shall her sweet life
9 3649     last?
9 3650   KING RICHARD. As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
9 3651   QUEEN ELIZABETH. As long as hell and Richard likes of it.
9 3652   KING RICHARD. Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.
9 3653   QUEEN ELIZABETH. But she, your subject, loathes such
9 3654     sovereignty.
9 3655   KING RICHARD. Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
9 3656   QUEEN ELIZABETH. An honest tale speeds best being plainly
9 3657     told.
9 3658   KING RICHARD. Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
9 3659   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
9 3660   KING RICHARD. Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
9 3661   QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, no, my reasons are too deep and
9 3662       dead-
9 3663     Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.
9 3664   KING RICHARD. Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
9 3665   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings
9 3666     break.
9 3667   KING RICHARD. Now, by my George, my garter, and my
9 3668     crown-
9 3669   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third
9 3670     usurp'd.
9 3671   KING RICHARD. I swear-
9 3672   QUEEN ELIZABETH. By nothing; for this is no oath:
9 3673     Thy George, profan'd, hath lost his lordly honour;
9 3674     Thy garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
9 3675     Thy crown, usurp'd, disgrac'd his kingly glory.
9 3676     If something thou wouldst swear to be believ'd,
9 3677     Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
9 3678   KING RICHARD. Then, by my self-
9 3679   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy self is self-misus'd.
9 3680   KING RICHARD. Now, by the world-
9 3681   QUEEN ELIZABETH. 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
9 3682   KING RICHARD. My father's death-
9 3683   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy life hath it dishonour'd.
9 3684   KING RICHARD. Why, then, by God-
9 3685   QUEEN ELIZABETH. God's wrong is most of all.
9 3686     If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,
9 3687     The unity the King my husband made
9 3688     Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.
9 3689     If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
9 3690     Th' imperial metal, circling now thy head,
9 3691     Had grac'd the tender temples of my child;
9 3692     And both the Princes had been breathing here,
9 3693     Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,
9 3694     Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.
9 3695     What canst thou swear by now?
9 3696   KING RICHARD. The time to come.
9 3697   QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time
9 3698     o'erpast;
9 3699     For I myself have many tears to wash
9 3700     Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
9 3701     The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd,
9 3702     Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
9 3703     The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed,
9 3704     Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
9 3705     Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
9 3706     Misus'd ere us'd, by times ill-us'd o'erpast.
9 3707   KING RICHARD. As I intend to prosper and repent,
9 3708     So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
9 3709     Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound!
9 3710     Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
9 3711     Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
9 3712     Be opposite all planets of good luck
9 3713     To my proceeding!-if, with dear heart's love,
9 3714     Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
9 3715     I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.
9 3716     In her consists my happiness and thine;
9 3717     Without her, follows to myself and thee,
9 3718     Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
9 3719     Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.
9 3720     It cannot be avoided but by this;
9 3721     It will not be avoided but by this.
9 3722     Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so-
9 3723     Be the attorney of my love to her;
9 3724     Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
9 3725     Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.
9 3726     Urge the necessity and state of times,
9 3727     And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
9 3728   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
9 3729   KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.
9 3730   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I forget myself to be myself?
9 3731   KING RICHARD. Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong
9 3732     yourself.
9 3733   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Yet thou didst kill my children.
9 3734   KING RICHARD. But in your daughter's womb I bury them;
9 3735     Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed
9 3736     Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
9 3737   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
9 3738   KING RICHARD. And be a happy mother by the deed.
9 3739   QUEEN ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly,
9 3740     And you shall understand from me her mind.
9 3741   KING RICHARD. Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
9 3742                                Kissing her. Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
9 3743     Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
9 3744 
9 3745                  Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following
9 3746 
9 3747     How now! what news?
9 3748   RATCLIFF. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast
9 3749     Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores
9 3750     Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
9 3751     Unarm'd, and unresolv'd to beat them back.
9 3752     'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
9 3753     And there they hull, expecting but the aid
9 3754     Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
9 3755   KING RICHARD. Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of
9 3756     Norfolk.
9 3757     Ratcliff, thyself-or Catesby; where is he?
9 3758   CATESBY. Here, my good lord.
9 3759   KING RICHARD. Catesby, fly to the Duke.
9 3760   CATESBY. I will my lord, with all convenient haste.
9 3761   KING RICHARD. Ratcliff, come hither. Post to Salisbury;
9 3762     When thou com'st thither-  [To CATESBY]  Dull,
9 3763     unmindfull villain,
9 3764     Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke?
9 3765   CATESBY. First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness' pleasure,
9 3766     What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.
9 3767   KING RICHARD. O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight
9 3768     The greatest strength and power that he can make
9 3769     And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
9 3770   CATESBY. I go.                                            Exit
9 3771   RATCLIFF. What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
9 3772   KING RICHARD. Why, what wouldst thou do there before I
9 3773     go?
9 3774   RATCLIFF. Your Highness told me I should post before.
9 3775   KING RICHARD. My mind is chang'd.
9 3776 
9 3777                            Enter LORD STANLEY
9 3778 
9 3779   STANLEY, what news with you?
9 3780   STANLEY. None good, my liege, to please you with
9 3781     the hearing;
9 3782     Nor none so bad but well may be reported.
9 3783   KING RICHARD. Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
9 3784     What need'st thou run so many miles about,
9 3785     When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way?
9 3786     Once more, what news?
9 3787   STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas.
9 3788   KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
9 3789     White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
9 3790   STANLEY. I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
9 3791   KING RICHARD. Well, as you guess?
9 3792   STANLEY. Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,
9 3793     He makes for England here to claim the crown.
9 3794   KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd?
9 3795     Is the King dead, the empire unpossess'd?
9 3796     What heir of York is there alive but we?
9 3797     And who is England's King but great York's heir?
9 3798     Then tell me what makes he upon the seas.
9 3799   STANLEY. Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
9 3800   KING RICHARD. Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
9 3801     You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
9 3802     Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.
9 3803   STANLEY. No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not.
9 3804   KING RICHARD. Where is thy power then, to beat him back?
9 3805     Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
9 3806     Are they not now upon the western shore,
9 3807     Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?
9 3808   STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
9 3809   KING RICHARD. Cold friends to me. What do they in the
9 3810     north,
9 3811     When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
9 3812   STANLEY. They have not been commanded, mighty King.
9 3813     Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,
9 3814     I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace
9 3815     Where and what time your Majesty shall please.
9 3816   KING RICHARD. Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with
9 3817     Richmond;
9 3818     But I'll not trust thee.
9 3819   STANLEY. Most mighty sovereign,
9 3820     You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.
9 3821     I never was nor never will be false.
9 3822   KING RICHARD. Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind
9 3823     Your son, George Stanley. Look your heart be firm,
9 3824     Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
9 3825   STANLEY. So deal with him as I prove true to you.         Exit
9 3826 
9 3827                           Enter a MESSENGER
9 3828 
9 3829   MESSENGER. My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
9 3830     As I by friends am well advertised,
9 3831     Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,
9 3832     Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,
9 3833     With many moe confederates, are in arms.
9 3834 
9 3835                          Enter another MESSENGER
9 3836 
9 3837   SECOND MESSENGER. In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in
9 3838     arms;
9 3839     And every hour more competitors
9 3840     Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.
9 3841 
9 3842                          Enter another MESSENGER
9 3843 
9 3844   THIRD MESSENGER. My lord, the army of great Buckingham-
9 3845   KING RICHARD. Out on you, owls! Nothing but songs of
9 3846     death?                                      [He strikes him]
9 3847     There, take thou that till thou bring better news.
9 3848   THIRD MESSENGER. The news I have to tell your Majesty
9 3849     Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
9 3850     Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd;
9 3851     And he himself wand'red away alone,
9 3852     No man knows whither.
9 3853   KING RICHARD. I cry thee mercy.
9 3854     There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
9 3855     Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
9 3856     Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
9 3857   THIRD MESSENGER. Such proclamation hath been made,
9 3858     my Lord.
9 3859 
9 3860                       Enter another MESSENGER
9 3861 
9 3862   FOURTH MESSENGER. Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis
9 3863     Dorset,
9 3864     'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
9 3865     But this good comfort bring I to your Highness-
9 3866     The Britaine navy is dispers'd by tempest.
9 3867     Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat
9 3868     Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
9 3869     If they were his assistants, yea or no;
9 3870     Who answer'd him they came from Buckingham
9 3871     Upon his party. He, mistrusting them,
9 3872     Hois'd sail, and made his course again for Britaine.
9 3873   KING RICHARD. March on, march on, since we are up in
9 3874     arms;
9 3875     If not to fight with foreign enemies,
9 3876     Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
9 3877 
9 3878                           Re-enter CATESBY
9 3879 
9 3880   CATESBY. My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken-
9 3881     That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond
9 3882     Is with a mighty power landed at Milford
9 3883     Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
9 3884   KING RICHARD. Away towards Salisbury! While we reason
9 3885     here
9 3886     A royal battle might be won and lost.
9 3887     Some one take order Buckingham be brought
9 3888     To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
9 3889     Flourish.                                             Exeunt

9 3897 
9 3898 Enter STANLEY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK
9 3899 
9 3900   STANLEY. Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
9 3901     That in the sty of the most deadly boar
9 3902     My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold;
9 3903     If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
9 3904     The fear of that holds off my present aid.
9 3905     So, get thee gone; commend me to thy lord.
9 3906     Withal say that the Queen hath heartily consented
9 3907     He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
9 3908     But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
9 3909   CHRISTOPHER. At Pembroke, or at Ha'rford west in Wales.
9 3910   STANLEY. What men of name resort to him?
9 3911   CHRISTOPHER. Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
9 3912   SIR Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
9 3913   OXFORD, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
9 3914     And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew;
9 3915     And many other of great name and worth;
9 3916     And towards London do they bend their power,
9 3917     If by the way they be not fought withal.
9 3918   STANLEY. Well, hie thee to thy lord; I kiss his hand;
9 3919     My letter will resolve him of my mind.
9 3920     Farewell.                                             Exeunt

9 3936 ACT V. SCENE 1.
9 3937 
9 3938 Salisbury. An open place
9 3939 
9 3940 Enter the SHERIFF and guard, with BUCKINGHAM, led to execution
9 3941 
9 3942   BUCKINGHAM. Will not King Richard let me speak with
9 3943     him?
9 3944   SHERIFF. No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
9 3945   BUCKINGHAM. Hastings, and Edward's children, Grey, and
9 3946     Rivers,
9 3947     Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
9 3948     Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
9 3949     By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
9 3950     If that your moody discontented souls
9 3951     Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
9 3952     Even for revenge mock my destruction!
9 3953     This is All-Souls' day, fellow, is it not?
9 3954   SHERIFF. It is, my lord.
9 3955   BUCKINGHAM. Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's
9 3956     doomsday.
9 3957     This is the day which in King Edward's time
9 3958     I wish'd might fall on me when I was found
9 3959     False to his children and his wife's allies;
9 3960     This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
9 3961     By the false faith of him whom most I trusted;
9 3962     This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
9 3963     Is the determin'd respite of my wrongs;
9 3964     That high All-Seer which I dallied with
9 3965     Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
9 3966     And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
9 3967     Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men
9 3968     To turn their own points in their masters' bosoms.
9 3969     Thus Margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck.
9 3970     'When he' quoth she 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
9 3971     Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
9 3972     Come lead me, officers, to the block of shame;
9 3973     Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
9 3974 Exeunt

9 3979 SCENE 2.
9 3980 
9 3981 Camp near Tamworth
9 3982 
9 3983 Enter RICHMOND, OXFORD, SIR JAMES BLUNT, SIR WALTER HERBERT, and
9 3984 others,
9 3985 with drum and colours
9 3986 
9 3987   RICHMOND. Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
9 3988     Bruis'd underneath the yoke of tyranny,
9 3989     Thus far into the bowels of the land
9 3990     Have we march'd on without impediment;
9 3991     And here receive we from our father Stanley
9 3992     Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
9 3993     The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
9 3994     That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
9 3995     Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
9 3996     In your embowell'd bosoms-this foul swine
9 3997     Is now even in the centre of this isle,
9 3998     Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.
9 3999     From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
9 4000     In God's name cheerly on, courageous friends,
9 4001     To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
9 4002     By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
9 4003   OXFORD. Every man's conscience is a thousand men,
9 4004     To fight against this guilty homicide.
9 4005   HERBERT. I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.
9 4006   BLUNT. He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,
9 4007     Which in his dearest need will fly from him.
9 4008   RICHMOND. All for our vantage. Then in God's name march.
9 4009     True hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings;
9 4010     Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.      Exeunt
9 4011 
9 4012 
9 4013 
9 4014 
9 4015 SCENE 3.
9 4016 
9 4017 Bosworth Field
9 4018 
9 4019 Enter KING RICHARD in arms, with NORFOLK, RATCLIFF,
9 4020 the EARL of SURREYS and others
9 4021 
9 4022   KING RICHARD. Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth
9 4023     field.
9 4024     My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
9 4025   SURREY. My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
9 4026   KING RICHARD. My Lord of Norfolk!
9 4027   NORFOLK. Here, most gracious liege.
9 4028   KING RICHARD. Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we
9 4029     not?
9 4030   NORFOLK. We must both give and take, my loving lord.
9 4031   KING RICHARD. Up With my tent! Here will I lie to-night;
9 4032                       [Soldiers begin to set up the KING'S tent]
9 4033     But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.
9 4034     Who hath descried the number of the traitors?
9 4035   NORFOLK. Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
9 4036   KING RICHARD. Why, our battalia trebles that account;
9 4037     Besides, the King's name is a tower of strength,
9 4038     Which they upon the adverse faction want.
9 4039     Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
9 4040     Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
9 4041     Call for some men of sound direction.
9 4042     Let's lack no discipline, make no delay;
9 4043     For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.                  Exeunt
9 4044 
9 4045              Enter, on the other side of the field,
9 4046           RICHMOND, SIR WILLIAM BRANDON, OXFORD, DORSET,
9 4047               and others. Some pitch RICHMOND'S tent
9 4048 
9 4049   RICHMOND. The weary sun hath made a golden set,
9 4050     And by the bright tract of his fiery car
9 4051     Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow.
9 4052     Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
9 4053     Give me some ink and paper in my tent.
9 4054     I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
9 4055     Limit each leader to his several charge,
9 4056     And part in just proportion our small power.
9 4057     My Lord of Oxford-you, Sir William Brandon-
9 4058     And you, Sir Walter Herbert-stay with me.
9 4059     The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment;
9 4060     Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him,
9 4061     And by the second hour in the morning
9 4062     Desire the Earl to see me in my tent.
9 4063     Yet one thing more, good Captain, do for me-
9 4064     Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, do you know?
9 4065   BLUNT. Unless I have mista'en his colours much-
9 4066     Which well I am assur'd I have not done-
9 4067     His regiment lies half a mile at least
9 4068     South from the mighty power of the King.
9 4069   RICHMOND. If without peril it be possible,
9 4070     Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him
9 4071     And give him from me this most needful note.
9 4072   BLUNT. Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;
9 4073     And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
9 4074   RICHMOND. Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come,
9 4075     gentlemen,
9 4076     Let us consult upon to-morrow's business.
9 4077     In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold.
9 4078                                    [They withdraw into the tent]
9 4079 
9 4080             Enter, to his-tent, KING RICHARD, NORFOLK,
9 4081                        RATCLIFF, and CATESBY
9 4082 
9 4083   KING RICHARD. What is't o'clock?
9 4084   CATESBY. It's supper-time, my lord;
9 4085     It's nine o'clock.
9 4086   KING RICHARD. I will not sup to-night.
9 4087     Give me some ink and paper.
9 4088     What, is my beaver easier than it was?
9 4089     And all my armour laid into my tent?
9 4090   CATESBY. It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
9 4091   KING RICHARD. Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
9 4092     Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
9 4093   NORFOLK. I go, my lord.
9 4094   KING RICHARD. Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
9 4095   NORFOLK. I warrant you, my lord.                          Exit
9 4096   KING RICHARD. Catesby!
9 4097   CATESBY. My lord?
9 4098   KING RICHARD. Send out a pursuivant-at-arms
9 4099     To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
9 4100     Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
9 4101     Into the blind cave of eternal night.           Exit CATESBY
9 4102     Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
9 4103     Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
9 4104     Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
9 4105     Ratcliff!
9 4106   RATCLIFF. My lord?
9 4107   KING RICHARD. Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord
9 4108     Northumberland?
9 4109   RATCLIFF. Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,
9 4110     Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
9 4111     Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
9 4112   KING RICHARD. So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.
9 4113     I have not that alacrity of spirit
9 4114     Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.
9 4115     Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
9 4116   RATCLIFF. It is, my lord.
9 4117   KING RICHARD. Bid my guard watch; leave me.
9 4118   RATCLIFF, about the mid of night come to my tent
9 4119     And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
9 4120                                    Exit RATCLIFF. RICHARD sleeps
9 4121 
9 4122                Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent;
9 4123                         LORDS attending
9 4124 
9 4125   DERBY. Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
9 4126   RICHMOND. All comfort that the dark night can afford
9 4127     Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
9 4128     Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
9 4129   DERBY. I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
9 4130     Who prays continually for Richmond's good.
9 4131     So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
9 4132     And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
9 4133     In brief, for so the season bids us be,
9 4134     Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
9 4135     And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
9 4136     Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
9 4137     I, as I may-that which I would I cannot-
9 4138     With best advantage will deceive the time
9 4139     And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms;
9 4140     But on thy side I may not be too forward,
9 4141     Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
9 4142     Be executed in his father's sight.
9 4143     Farewell; the leisure and the fearful time
9 4144     Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
9 4145     And ample interchange of sweet discourse
9 4146     Which so-long-sund'red friends should dwell upon.
9 4147     God give us leisure for these rites of love!
9 4148     Once more, adieu; be valiant, and speed well!
9 4149   RICHMOND. Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.
9 4150     I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,
9 4151     Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow
9 4152     When I should mount with wings of victory.
9 4153     Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
9 4154                                          Exeunt all but RICHMOND
9 4155     O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
9 4156     Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
9 4157     Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath,
9 4158     That they may crush down with a heavy fall
9 4159     The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
9 4160     Make us Thy ministers of chastisement,
9 4161     That we may praise Thee in the victory!
9 4162     To Thee I do commend my watchful soul
9 4163     Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.
9 4164     Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!            [Sleeps]
9 4165 
9 4166             Enter the GHOST Of YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD,
9 4167                     son to HENRY THE SIXTH
9 4168 
9 4169   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy on thy soul
9 4170     to-morrow!
9 4171     Think how thou stabb'dst me in my prime of youth
9 4172     At Tewksbury; despair, therefore, and die!
9 4173     [To RICHMOND]  Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged
9 4174     souls
9 4175     Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf.
9 4176     King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.
9 4177 
9 4178               Enter the GHOST of HENRY THE SIXTH
9 4179 
9 4180   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  When I was mortal, my anointed
9 4181     body
9 4182     By thee was punched full of deadly holes.
9 4183     Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die.
9 4184     Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
9 4185     [To RICHMOND]  Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!
9 4186     Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be King,
9 4187     Doth comfort thee in thy sleep. Live and flourish!
9 4188 
9 4189                    Enter the GHOST of CLARENCE
9 4190 
9 4191   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy soul
9 4192     to-morrow! I that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine,
9 4193     Poor Clarence, by thy guile betray'd to death!
9 4194     To-morrow in the battle think on me,
9 4195     And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!
9 4196     [To RICHMOND]  Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,
9 4197     The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee.
9 4198     Good angels guard thy battle! Live and flourish!
9 4199 
9 4200            Enter the GHOSTS of RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN
9 4201 
9 4202   GHOST OF RIVERS.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy
9 4203     soul to-morrow,
9 4204     Rivers that died at Pomfret! Despair and die!
9 4205   GHOST OF GREY.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Grey, and let
9 4206     thy soul despair!
9 4207   GHOST OF VAUGHAN.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Vaughan,
9 4208     and with guilty fear
9 4209     Let fall thy lance. Despair and die!
9 4210   ALL.  [To RICHMOND]  Awake, and think our wrongs in
9 4211     Richard's bosom
9 4212     Will conquer him. Awake and win the day.
9 4213 
9 4214                 Enter the GHOST of HASTINGS
9 4215 
9 4216   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
9 4217     And in a bloody battle end thy days!
9 4218     Think on Lord Hastings. Despair and die.
9 4219     [To RICHMOND]   Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
9 4220     Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!
9 4221 
9 4222          Enter the GHOSTS of the two young PRINCES
9 4223 
9 4224   GHOSTS.  [To RICHARD]  Dream on thy cousins smothered in
9 4225     the Tower.
9 4226     Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,
9 4227     And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
9 4228     Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.
9 4229     [To RICHMOND]  Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and
9 4230     wake in joy;
9 4231     Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
9 4232     Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
9 4233     Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
9 4234 
9 4235           Enter the GHOST of LADY ANNE, his wife
9 4236 
9 4237   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Richard, thy wife, that wretched
9 4238     Anne thy wife
9 4239     That never slept a quiet hour with thee
9 4240     Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
9 4241     To-morrow in the battle think on me,
9 4242     And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die.
9 4243     [To RICHMOND]  Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;
9 4244     Dream of success and happy victory.
9 4245     Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.
9 4246 
9 4247                    Enter the GHOST of BUCKINGHAM
9 4248 
9 4249   GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  The first was I that help'd thee
9 4250     to the crown;
9 4251     The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
9 4252     O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
9 4253     And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
9 4254     Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death;
9 4255     Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
9 4256     [To RICHMOND]  I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid;
9 4257     But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay'd:
9 4258     God and good angels fight on Richmond's side;
9 4259     And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
9 4260             [The GHOSTS vanish. RICHARD starts out of his dream]
9 4261   KING RICHARD. Give me another horse. Bind up my wounds.
9 4262     Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.
9 4263     O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
9 4264     The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
9 4265     Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
9 4266     What do I fear? Myself? There's none else by.
9 4267     Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
9 4268     Is there a murderer here? No-yes, I am.
9 4269     Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why-
9 4270     Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself!
9 4271     Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good
9 4272     That I myself have done unto myself?
9 4273     O, no! Alas, I rather hate myself
9 4274     For hateful deeds committed by myself!
9 4275     I am a villain; yet I lie, I am not.
9 4276     Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.
9 4277     My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
9 4278     And every tongue brings in a several tale,
9 4279     And every tale condemns me for a villain.
9 4280     Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;
9 4281     Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;
9 4282     All several sins, all us'd in each degree,
9 4283     Throng to the bar, crying all 'Guilty! guilty!'
9 4284     I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
9 4285     And if I die no soul will pity me:
9 4286     And wherefore should they, since that I myself
9 4287     Find in myself no pity to myself?
9 4288     Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
9 4289     Came to my tent, and every one did threat
9 4290     To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
9 4291 
9 4292                             Enter RATCLIFF
9 4293 
9 4294   RATCLIFF. My lord!
9 4295   KING RICHARD. Zounds, who is there?
9 4296   RATCLIFF. Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
9 4297     Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
9 4298     Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.
9 4299   KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
9 4300     What think'st thou-will our friends prove all true?
9 4301   RATCLIFF. No doubt, my lord.
9 4302   KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear.
9 4303   RATCLIFF. Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
9 4304   KING RICHARD By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
9 4305     Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard
9 4306     Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
9 4307     Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
9 4308     'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
9 4309     Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
9 4310     To see if any mean to shrink from me.                 Exeunt
9 4311 
9 4312           Enter the LORDS to RICHMOND sitting in his tent
9 4313 
9 4314   LORDS. Good morrow, Richmond!
9 4315   RICHMOND. Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
9 4316     That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
9 4317   LORDS. How have you slept, my lord?
9 4318   RICHMOND. The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams
9 4319     That ever ent'red in a drowsy head
9 4320     Have I since your departure had, my lords.
9 4321     Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd
9 4322     Came to my tent and cried on victory.
9 4323     I promise you my soul is very jocund
9 4324     In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
9 4325     How far into the morning is it, lords?
9 4326   LORDS. Upon the stroke of four.
9 4327   RICHMOND. Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
9 4328 
9 4329                  His ORATION to his SOLDIERS
9 4330 
9 4331     More than I have said, loving countrymen,
9 4332     The leisure and enforcement of the time
9 4333     Forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this:
9 4334     God and our good cause fight upon our side;
9 4335     The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
9 4336     Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
9 4337     Richard except, those whom we fight against
9 4338     Had rather have us win than him they follow.
9 4339     For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
9 4340     A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
9 4341     One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
9 4342     One that made means to come by what he hath,
9 4343     And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
9 4344     A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
9 4345     Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
9 4346     One that hath ever been God's enemy.
9 4347     Then if you fight against God's enemy,
9 4348     God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
9 4349     If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
9 4350     You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
9 4351     If you do fight against your country's foes,
9 4352     Your country's foes shall pay your pains the hire;
9 4353     If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
9 4354     Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
9 4355     If you do free your children from the sword,
9 4356     Your children's children quits it in your age.
9 4357     Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
9 4358     Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
9 4359     For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
9 4360     Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
9 4361     But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
9 4362     The least of you shall share his part thereof.
9 4363     Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
9 4364     God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!           Exeunt
9 4365 
9 4366            Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, attendants,
9 4367                          and forces
9 4368 
9 4369   KING RICHARD. What said Northumberland as touching
9 4370     Richmond?
9 4371   RATCLIFF. That he was never trained up in arms.
9 4372   KING RICHARD. He said the truth; and what said Surrey
9 4373     then?
9 4374   RATCLIFF. He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.'
9 4375   KING He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
9 4376                                                  [Clock strikes]
9 4377     Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
9 4378     Who saw the sun to-day?
9 4379   RATCLIFF. Not I, my lord.
9 4380   KING RICHARD. Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
9 4381     He should have brav'd the east an hour ago.
9 4382     A black day will it be to somebody.
9 4383     Ratcliff!
9 4384   RATCLIFF. My lord?
9 4385   KING RICHARD. The sun will not be seen to-day;
9 4386     The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
9 4387     I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
9 4388     Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
9 4389     More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven
9 4390     That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
9 4391 
9 4392                        Enter NORFOLK
9 4393 
9 4394   NORFOLK. Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
9 4395   KING RICHARD. Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse;
9 4396     Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.
9 4397     I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
9 4398     And thus my battle shall be ordered:
9 4399     My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
9 4400     Consisting equally of horse and foot;
9 4401     Our archers shall be placed in the midst.
9 4402     John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
9 4403     Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
9 4404     They thus directed, we will follow
9 4405     In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
9 4406     Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
9 4407     This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou,
9 4408     Norfolk?
9 4409   NORFOLK. A good direction, warlike sovereign.
9 4410     This found I on my tent this morning.
9 4411                                         [He sheweth him a paper]
9 4412   KING RICHARD.                                          [Reads]
9 4413     'Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold,
9 4414     For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
9 4415     A thing devised by the enemy.
9 4416     Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.
9 4417     Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;
9 4418     Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
9 4419     Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe.
9 4420     Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
9 4421     March on, join bravely, let us to it pell-mell;
9 4422     If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
9 4423 
9 4424                       His ORATION to his ARMY
9 4425 
9 4426     What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
9 4427     Remember whom you are to cope withal-
9 4428     A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
9 4429     A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
9 4430     Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
9 4431     To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.
9 4432     You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
9 4433     You having lands, and bless'd with beauteous wives,
9 4434     They would restrain the one, distain the other.
9 4435     And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
9 4436     Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost?
9 4437     A milk-sop, one that never in his life
9 4438     Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
9 4439     Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
9 4440     Lash hence these over-weening rags of France,
9 4441     These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
9 4442     Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
9 4443     For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves.
9 4444     If we be conquered, let men conquer us,
9 4445     And not these bastard Britaines, whom our fathers
9 4446     Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
9 4447     And, in record, left them the heirs of shame.
9 4448     Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives,
9 4449     Ravish our daughters?  [Drum afar off]  Hark! I hear their
9 4450     drum.
9 4451     Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen!
9 4452     Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
9 4453     Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
9 4454     Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
9 4455 
9 4456                         Enter a MESSENGER
9 4457 
9 4458     What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?
9 4459   MESSENGER. My lord, he doth deny to come.
9 4460   KING RICHARD. Off with his son George's head!
9 4461   NORFOLK. My lord, the enemy is pass'd the marsh.
9 4462     After the battle let George Stanley die.
9 4463   KING RICHARD. A thousand hearts are great within my
9 4464     bosom.
9 4465     Advance our standards, set upon our foes;
9 4466     Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
9 4467     Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
9 4468     Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.                 Exeunt

9 4473 SCENE 4.
9 4474 
9 4475 Another part of the field
9 4476 
9 4477 Alarum; excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces; to him CATESBY
9 4478 
9 4479   CATESBY. Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
9 4480     The King enacts more wonders than a man,
9 4481     Daring an opposite to every danger.
9 4482     His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
9 4483     Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
9 4484     Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost.
9 4485 
9 4486                      Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD
9 4487 
9 4488   KING RICHARD. A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
9 4489   CATESBY. Withdraw, my lord! I'll help you to a horse.
9 4490   KING RICHARD. Slave, I have set my life upon a cast
9 4491     And I Will stand the hazard of the die.
9 4492     I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
9 4493     Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
9 4494     A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt

9 4499 SCENE 5.
9 4500 
9 4501 Another part of the field
9 4502 
9 4503 Alarum. Enter RICHARD and RICHMOND; they fight; RICHARD is slain.
9 4504 Retreat and flourish. Enter RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the crown,
9 4505 with other LORDS
9 4506 
9 4507   RICHMOND. God and your arms be prais'd, victorious friends;
9 4508     The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
9 4509   DERBY. Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee!
9 4510     Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
9 4511     From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
9 4512     Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal.
9 4513     Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
9 4514   RICHMOND. Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
9 4515     But, teLL me is young George Stanley living.
9 4516   DERBY. He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,
9 4517     Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
9 4518   RICHMOND. What men of name are slain on either side?
9 4519   DERBY. John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
9 4520     Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
9 4521   RICHMOND. Inter their bodies as becomes their births.
9 4522     Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
9 4523     That in submission will return to us.
9 4524     And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
9 4525     We will unite the white rose and the red.
9 4526     Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
9 4527     That long have frown'd upon their emnity!
9 4528     What traitor hears me, and says not Amen?
9 4529     England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
9 4530     The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
9 4531     The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
9 4532     The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire;
9 4533     All this divided York and Lancaster,
9 4534     Divided in their dire division,
9 4535     O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,
9 4536     The true succeeders of each royal house,
9 4537     By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
9 4538     And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so,
9 4539     Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace,
9 4540     With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!
9 4541     Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
9 4542     That would reduce these bloody days again
9 4543     And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
9 4544     Let them not live to taste this land's increase
9 4545     That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
9 4546     Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again-
9 4547     That she may long live here, God say Amen!            Exeunt

9 4829 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
9 4830 
9 4831 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
9 4832 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
9 4833 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
9 4834 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
9 4835 people in all walks of life.
9 4836 
9 4837 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
9 4838 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
9 4839 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
9 4840 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
9 4841 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
9 4842 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

9 4874 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
9 4875 Literary Archive Foundation
9 4876 
9 4877 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
9 4878 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
9 4879 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
9 4880 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
9 4881 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
9 4882 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
9 4883 status with the IRS.
9 4884 
9 4885 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
9 4886 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
9 4887 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
9 4888 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
9 4889 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
9 4890 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
9 4891 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
9 4892 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
9 4893 
9 4894 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
9 4895 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
9 4896 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
9 4897 approach us with offers to donate.
9 4898 
9 4899 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
9 4900 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
9 4901 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
9 4902 
9 4903 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
9 4904 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
9 4905 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

9 4909 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
9 4910 works.
9 4911 
9 4912 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
9 4913 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
9 4914 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
9 4915 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
9 4916 
9 4917 
9 4918 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
9 4919 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
9 4920 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
9 4921 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

9 4928 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
9 4929 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
9 4930 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
