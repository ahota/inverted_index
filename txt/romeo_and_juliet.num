2 71                         Enter Chorus.
2 72 
2 73 
2 74   Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,
2 75     In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
2 76     From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
2 77     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
2 78     From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
2 79     A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
2 80     Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
2 81     Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
2 82     The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
2 83     And the continuance of their parents' rage,
2 84     Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
2 85     Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
2 86     The which if you with patient ears attend,
2 87     What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
2 88                                                          [Exit.]

2 93 ACT I. Scene I.
2 94 Verona. A public place.
2 95 
2 96 Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
2 97 of Capulet.
2 98 
2 99 
2 100   Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
2 101 
2 102   Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
2 103 
2 104   Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
2 105 
2 106   Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
2 107 
2 108   Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
2 109 
2 110   Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
2 111 
2 112   Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
2 113 
2 114   Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
2 115     Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
2 116 
2 117   Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
2 118     the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
2 119 
2 120   Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
2 121     wall.
2 122 
2 123   Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
2 124     are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
2 125     from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
2 126 
2 127   Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
2 128 
2 129   Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
2 130     fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
2 131     their heads.
2 132 
2 133   Greg. The heads of the maids?
2 134 
2 135   Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
2 136     Take it in what sense thou wilt.
2 137 
2 138   Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.
2 139 
2 140   Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
2 141     am a pretty piece of flesh.
2 142 
2 143   Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
2 144     been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
2 145     Montagues.
2 146 
2 147            Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].
2 148 
2 149 
2 150   Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
2 151 
2 152   Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
2 153 
2 154   Samp. Fear me not.
2 155 
2 156   Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
2 157 
2 158   Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
2 159 
2 160   Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
2 161 
2 162   Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
2 163     disgrace to them, if they bear it.
2 164 
2 165   Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
2 166 
2 167   Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
2 168 
2 169   Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
2 170 
2 171   Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
2 172 
2 173   Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.
2 174 
2 175   Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
2 176     thumb, sir.
2 177 
2 178   Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
2 179 
2 180   Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
2 181 
2 182   Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
2 183     you.
2 184 
2 185   Abr. No better.
2 186 
2 187   Samp. Well, sir.
2 188 
2 189                         Enter Benvolio.
2 190 
2 191 
2 192   Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
2 193     master's kinsmen.
2 194 
2 195   Samp. Yes, better, sir.
2 196 
2 197   Abr. You lie.
2 198 
2 199   Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
2 200                                                      They fight.
2 201 
2 202   Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
2 203     Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
2 204 
2 205                           Enter Tybalt.
2 206 
2 207 
2 208   Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
2 209     Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
2 210 
2 211   Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
2 212     Or manage it to part these men with me.
2 213 
2 214   Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
2 215     As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
2 216     Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.
2 217 
2 218      Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
2 219                           partisans.
2 220 
2 221 
2 222   Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
2 223 
2 224   Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
2 225 
2 226            Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.
2 227 
2 228 
2 229   Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
2 230 
2 231   Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
2 232 
2 233   Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
2 234     And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
2 235 
2 236                  Enter Old Montague and his Wife.
2 237 
2 238 
2 239   Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
2 240 
2 241   M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
2 242 
2 243                 Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.
2 244 
2 245 
2 246   Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
2 247     Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
2 248     Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
2 249     That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
2 250     With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
2 251     On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
2 252     Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
2 253     And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
2 254     Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
2 255     By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
2 256     Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
2 257     And made Verona's ancient citizens
2 258     Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
2 259     To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
2 260     Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
2 261     If ever you disturb our streets again,
2 262     Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
2 263     For this time all the rest depart away.
2 264     You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
2 265     And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
2 266     To know our farther pleasure in this case,
2 267     To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
2 268     Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
2 269               Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].
2 270 
2 271   Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
2 272     Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
2 273 
2 274   Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
2 275     And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
2 276     I drew to part them. In the instant came
2 277     The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
2 278     Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
2 279     He swung about his head and cut the winds,
2 280     Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
2 281     While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
2 282     Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
2 283     Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
2 284 
2 285   M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
2 286     Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
2 287 
2 288   Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
2 289     Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
2 290     A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
2 291     Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
2 292     That westward rooteth from the city's side,
2 293     So early walking did I see your son.
2 294     Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
2 295     And stole into the covert of the wood.
2 296     I- measuring his affections by my own,
2 297     Which then most sought where most might not be found,
2 298     Being one too many by my weary self-
2 299     Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
2 300     And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
2 301 
2 302   Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
2 303     With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
2 304     Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
2 305     But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
2 306     Should in the furthest East bean to draw
2 307     The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
2 308     Away from light steals home my heavy son
2 309     And private in his chamber pens himself,
2 310     Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
2 311     And makes himself an artificial night.
2 312     Black and portentous must this humour prove
2 313     Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
2 314 
2 315   Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
2 316 
2 317   Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him
2 318 
2 319   Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
2 320 
2 321   Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
2 322     But he, his own affections' counsellor,
2 323     Is to himself- I will not say how true-
2 324     But to himself so secret and so close,
2 325     So far from sounding and discovery,
2 326     As is the bud bit with an envious worm
2 327     Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
2 328     Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
2 329     Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
2 330     We would as willingly give cure as know.
2 331 
2 332                        Enter Romeo.
2 333 
2 334 
2 335   Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
2 336     I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
2 337 
2 338   Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
2 339     To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
2 340                                      Exeunt [Montague and Wife].
2 341 
2 342   Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
2 343 
2 344   Rom. Is the day so young?
2 345 
2 346   Ben. But new struck nine.
2 347 
2 348   Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
2 349     Was that my father that went hence so fast?
2 350 
2 351   Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
2 352 
2 353   Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.
2 354 
2 355   Ben. In love?
2 356 
2 357   Rom. Out-
2 358 
2 359   Ben. Of love?
2 360 
2 361   Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
2 362 
2 363   Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
2 364     Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
2 365 
2 366   Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
2 367     Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
2 368     Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
2 369     Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
2 370     Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
2 371     Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
2 372     O anything, of nothing first create!
2 373     O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
2 374     Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
2 375     Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
2 376     Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
2 377     This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
2 378     Dost thou not laugh?
2 379 
2 380   Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
2 381 
2 382   Rom. Good heart, at what?
2 383 
2 384   Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.
2 385 
2 386   Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
2 387     Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
2 388     Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
2 389     With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
2 390     Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
2 391     Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
2 392     Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
2 393     Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
2 394     What is it else? A madness most discreet,
2 395     A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
2 396     Farewell, my coz.
2 397 
2 398   Ben. Soft! I will go along.
2 399     An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
2 400 
2 401   Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
2 402     This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
2 403 
2 404   Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
2 405 
2 406   Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
2 407 
2 408   Ben. Groan? Why, no;
2 409     But sadly tell me who.
2 410 
2 411   Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
2 412     Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
2 413     In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
2 414 
2 415   Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
2 416 
2 417   Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
2 418 
2 419   Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
2 420 
2 421   Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
2 422     With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
2 423     And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
2 424     From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
2 425     She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
2 426     Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
2 427     Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
2 428     O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
2 429     That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
2 430 
2 431   Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
2 432 
2 433   Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
2 434     For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
2 435     Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
2 436     She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
2 437     To merit bliss by making me despair.
2 438     She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
2 439     Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
2 440 
2 441   Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
2 442 
2 443   Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
2 444 
2 445   Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
2 446     Examine other beauties.
2 447 
2 448   Rom. 'Tis the way
2 449     To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
2 450     These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
2 451     Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
2 452     He that is strucken blind cannot forget
2 453     The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
2 454     Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
2 455     What doth her beauty serve but as a note
2 456     Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
2 457     Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
2 458 
2 459   Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.
2 460 
2 461 
2 462 
2 463 
2 464 Scene II.
2 465 A Street.
2 466 
2 467 Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.
2 468 
2 469 
2 470   Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
2 471     In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
2 472     For men so old as we to keep the peace.
2 473 
2 474   Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
2 475     And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
2 476     But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
2 477 
2 478   Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
2 479     My child is yet a stranger in the world,
2 480     She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
2 481     Let two more summers wither in their pride
2 482     Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
2 483 
2 484   Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
2 485 
2 486   Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
2 487     The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
2 488     She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
2 489     But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
2 490     My will to her consent is but a part.
2 491     An she agree, within her scope of choice
2 492     Lies my consent and fair according voice.
2 493     This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
2 494     Whereto I have invited many a guest,
2 495     Such as I love; and you among the store,
2 496     One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
2 497     At my poor house look to behold this night
2 498     Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
2 499     Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
2 500     When well apparell'd April on the heel
2 501     Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
2 502     Among fresh female buds shall you this night
2 503     Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
2 504     And like her most whose merit most shall be;
2 505     Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
2 506     May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
2 507     Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,
2 508     sirrah, trudge about
2 509     Through fair Verona; find those persons out
2 510     Whose names are written there, and to them say,
2 511     My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
2 512                                      Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].
2 513 
2 514   Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
2 515     that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
2 516     with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
2 517     with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
2 518     here writ, and can never find what names the writing person
2 519     hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!
2 520 
2 521                    Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
2 522 
2 523 
2 524   Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
2 525     One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
2 526     Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
2 527     One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
2 528     Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
2 529     And the rank poison of the old will die.
2 530 
2 531   Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
2 532 
2 533   Ben. For what, I pray thee?
2 534 
2 535   Rom. For your broken shin.
2 536 
2 537   Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
2 538 
2 539   Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
2 540     Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
2 541     Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.
2 542 
2 543   Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
2 544 
2 545   Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
2 546 
2 547   Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
2 548     you read anything you see?
2 549 
2 550   Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
2 551 
2 552   Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
2 553 
2 554   Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
2 555 
2 556       'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
2 557       County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
2 558       The lady widow of Vitruvio;
2 559       Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
2 560       Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
2 561       Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
2 562       My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
2 563       Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
2 564       Lucio and the lively Helena.'
2 565 
2 566     [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
2 567     come?
2 568 
2 569   Serv. Up.
2 570 
2 571   Rom. Whither?
2 572 
2 573   Serv. To supper, to our house.
2 574 
2 575   Rom. Whose house?
2 576 
2 577   Serv. My master's.
2 578 
2 579   Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
2 580 
2 581   Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
2 582     rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
2 583     come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.
2 584 
2 585   Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
2 586     Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
2 587     With all the admired beauties of Verona.
2 588     Go thither, and with unattainted eye
2 589     Compare her face with some that I shall show,
2 590     And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
2 591 
2 592   Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
2 593     Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
2 594     And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
2 595     Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
2 596     One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
2 597     Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
2 598 
2 599   Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
2 600     Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
2 601     But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
2 602     Your lady's love against some other maid
2 603     That I will show you shining at this feast,
2 604     And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
2 605 
2 606   Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
2 607     But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]
2 608 
2 609 
2 610 
2 611 
2 612 Scene III.
2 613 Capulet's house.
2 614 
2 615 Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.
2 616 
2 617 
2 618   Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
2 619 
2 620   Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
2 621     I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
2 622     God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
2 623 
2 624                          Enter Juliet.
2 625 
2 626 
2 627   Jul. How now? Who calls?
2 628 
2 629   Nurse. Your mother.
2 630 
2 631   Jul. Madam, I am here.
2 632     What is your will?
2 633 
2 634   Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
2 635     We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
2 636     I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
2 637     Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
2 638 
2 639   Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
2 640 
2 641   Wife. She's not fourteen.
2 642 
2 643   Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
2 644     And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
2 645     She is not fourteen. How long is it now
2 646     To Lammastide?
2 647 
2 648   Wife. A fortnight and odd days.
2 649 
2 650   Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
2 651     Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
2 652     Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
2 653     Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
2 654     She was too good for me. But, as I said,
2 655     On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
2 656     That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
2 657     'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
2 658     And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
2 659     Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
2 660     For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
2 661     Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
2 662     My lord and you were then at Mantua.
2 663     Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
2 664     When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
2 665     Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
2 666     To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
2 667     Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
2 668     To bid me trudge.
2 669     And since that time it is eleven years,
2 670     For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
2 671     She could have run and waddled all about;
2 672     For even the day before, she broke her brow;
2 673     And then my husband (God be with his soul!
2 674     'A was a merry man) took up the child.
2 675     'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
2 676     Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
2 677     Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
2 678     The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
2 679     To see now how a jest shall come about!
2 680     I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
2 681     I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
2 682     And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
2 683 
2 684   Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
2 685 
2 686   Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
2 687     To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
2 688     And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
2 689     A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
2 690     A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
2 691     'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
2 692     Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
2 693     Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
2 694 
2 695   Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
2 696 
2 697   Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
2 698     Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
2 699     An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
2 700 
2 701   Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
2 702     I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
2 703     How stands your disposition to be married?
2 704 
2 705   Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
2 706 
2 707   Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
2 708     I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
2 709 
2 710   Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
2 711     Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
2 712     Are made already mothers. By my count,
2 713     I was your mother much upon these years
2 714     That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
2 715     The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
2 716 
2 717   Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
2 718     As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
2 719 
2 720   Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
2 721 
2 722   Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
2 723 
2 724   Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
2 725     This night you shall behold him at our feast.
2 726     Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
2 727     And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
2 728     Examine every married lineament,
2 729     And see how one another lends content;
2 730     And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
2 731     Find written in the margent of his eyes,
2 732     This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
2 733     To beautify him only lacks a cover.
2 734     The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
2 735     For fair without the fair within to hide.
2 736     That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
2 737     That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
2 738     So shall you share all that he doth possess,
2 739     By having him making yourself no less.
2 740 
2 741   Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
2 742 
2 743   Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
2 744 
2 745   Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
2 746     But no more deep will I endart mine eye
2 747     Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
2 748 
2 749                         Enter Servingman.
2 750 
2 751 
2 752   Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
2 753     my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
2 754     everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
2 755     follow straight.
2 756 
2 757   Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
2 758     Juliet, the County stays.
2 759 
2 760   Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
2 761                                                          Exeunt.
2 762 
2 763 
2 764 
2 765 
2 766 Scene IV.
2 767 A street.
2 768 
2 769 Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
2 770 Torchbearers.
2 771 
2 772 
2 773   Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
2 774     Or shall we on without apology?
2 775 
2 776   Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
2 777     We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
2 778     Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
2 779     Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
2 780     Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
2 781     After the prompter, for our entrance;
2 782     But, let them measure us by what they will,
2 783     We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
2 784 
2 785   Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
2 786     Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
2 787 
2 788   Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
2 789 
2 790   Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
2 791     With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
2 792     So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
2 793 
2 794   Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
2 795     And soar with them above a common bound.
2 796 
2 797   Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
2 798     To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
2 799     I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
2 800     Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
2 801 
2 802   Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
2 803     Too great oppression for a tender thing.
2 804 
2 805   Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
2 806     Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
2 807 
2 808   Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
2 809     Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
2 810     Give me a case to put my visage in.
2 811     A visor for a visor! What care I
2 812     What curious eye doth quote deformities?
2 813     Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
2 814 
2 815   Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
2 816     But every man betake him to his legs.
2 817 
2 818   Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
2 819     Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
2 820     For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
2 821     I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
2 822     The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
2 823 
2 824   Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
2 825     If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
2 826     Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
2 827     Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
2 828 
2 829   Rom. Nay, that's not so.
2 830 
2 831   Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
2 832     We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
2 833     Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
2 834     Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
2 835 
2 836   Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
2 837     But 'tis no wit to go.
2 838 
2 839   Mer. Why, may one ask?
2 840 
2 841   Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
2 842 
2 843   Mer. And so did I.
2 844 
2 845   Rom. Well, what was yours?
2 846 
2 847   Mer. That dreamers often lie.
2 848 
2 849   Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
2 850 
2 851   Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
2 852     She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
2 853     In shape no bigger than an agate stone
2 854     On the forefinger of an alderman,
2 855     Drawn with a team of little atomies
2 856     Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
2 857     Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
2 858     The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
2 859     Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
2 860     Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
2 861     Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
2 862     Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
2 863     Not half so big as a round little worm
2 864     Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
2 865     Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
2 866     Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
2 867     Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
2 868     And in this state she 'gallops night by night
2 869     Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
2 870     O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
2 871     O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
2 872     O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
2 873     Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
2 874     Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
2 875     Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
2 876     And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
2 877     And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
2 878     Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
2 879     Then dreams he of another benefice.
2 880     Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
2 881     And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
2 882     Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
2 883     Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
2 884     Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
2 885     And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
2 886     And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
2 887     That plats the manes of horses in the night
2 888     And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
2 889     Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
2 890     This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
2 891     That presses them and learns them first to bear,
2 892     Making them women of good carriage.
2 893     This is she-
2 894 
2 895   Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
2 896     Thou talk'st of nothing.
2 897 
2 898   Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
2 899     Which are the children of an idle brain,
2 900     Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
2 901     Which is as thin of substance as the air,
2 902     And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
2 903     Even now the frozen bosom of the North
2 904     And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
2 905     Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.
2 906 
2 907   Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
2 908     Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
2 909 
2 910   Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
2 911     Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
2 912     Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
2 913     With this night's revels and expire the term
2 914     Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
2 915     By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
2 916     But he that hath the steerage of my course
2 917     Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
2 918 
2 919   Ben. Strike, drum.
2 920                            They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]

2 925 Scene V.
2 926 Capulet's house.
2 927 
2 928 Servingmen come forth with napkins.
2 929 
2 930   1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
2 931     He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
2 932   2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
2 933     hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
2 934   1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
2 935     look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
2 936     thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
2 937 Nell.
2 938     Anthony, and Potpan!
2 939   2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
2 940   1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
2 941     sought for, in the great chamber.
2 942   3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
2 943     Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.
2 944 
2 945     Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
2 946               Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
2 947                and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
2 948 
2 949 
2 950   Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
2 951     Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
2 952     Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
2 953     Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
2 954     She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
2 955     Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
2 956     That I have worn a visor and could tell
2 957     A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
2 958     Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
2 959     You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
2 960     A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
2 961                                     Music plays, and they dance.
2 962     More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
2 963     And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
2 964     Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
2 965     Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
2 966     For you and I are past our dancing days.
2 967     How long is't now since last yourself and I
2 968     Were in a mask?
2 969   2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.
2 970 
2 971   Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
2 972     'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
2 973     Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
2 974     Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
2 975   2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
2 976     His son is thirty.
2 977 
2 978   Cap. Will you tell me that?
2 979     His son was but a ward two years ago.
2 980 
2 981   Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
2 982     hand Of yonder knight?
2 983 
2 984   Serv. I know not, sir.
2 985 
2 986   Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
2 987     It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
2 988     Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
2 989     Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
2 990     So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
2 991     As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
2 992     The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
2 993     And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
2 994     Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
2 995     For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
2 996 
2 997   Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
2 998     Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
2 999     Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
2 1000     To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
2 1001     Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
2 1002     To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
2 1003 
2 1004   Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
2 1005 
2 1006   Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
2 1007     A villain, that is hither come in spite
2 1008     To scorn at our solemnity this night.
2 1009 
2 1010   Cap. Young Romeo is it?
2 1011 
2 1012   Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
2 1013 
2 1014   Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
2 1015     'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
2 1016     And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
2 1017     To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
2 1018     I would not for the wealth of all this town
2 1019     Here in my house do him disparagement.
2 1020     Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
2 1021     It is my will; the which if thou respect,
2 1022     Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
2 1023     An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
2 1024 
2 1025   Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
2 1026     I'll not endure him.
2 1027 
2 1028   Cap. He shall be endur'd.
2 1029     What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
2 1030     Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
2 1031     You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
2 1032     You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
2 1033     You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
2 1034 
2 1035   Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
2 1036 
2 1037   Cap. Go to, go to!
2 1038     You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
2 1039     This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
2 1040     You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
2 1041     Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
2 1042     Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
2 1043     I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
2 1044 
2 1045   Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
2 1046     Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
2 1047     I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
2 1048     Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.
2 1049 
2 1050   Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
2 1051     This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
2 1052     My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
2 1053     To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
2 1054 
2 1055   Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
2 1056     Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
2 1057     For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
2 1058     And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
2 1059 
2 1060   Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
2 1061 
2 1062   Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
2 1063 
2 1064   Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
2 1065     They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
2 1066 
2 1067   Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
2 1068 
2 1069   Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
2 1070     Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]
2 1071 
2 1072   Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
2 1073 
2 1074   Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
2 1075     Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]
2 1076 
2 1077   Jul. You kiss by th' book.
2 1078 
2 1079   Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
2 1080 
2 1081   Rom. What is her mother?
2 1082 
2 1083   Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
2 1084     Her mother is the lady of the house.
2 1085     And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
2 1086     I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
2 1087     I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
2 1088     Shall have the chinks.
2 1089 
2 1090   Rom. Is she a Capulet?
2 1091     O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
2 1092 
2 1093   Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
2 1094 
2 1095   Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
2 1096 
2 1097   Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
2 1098     We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
2 1099     Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
2 1100     I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
2 1101     More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
2 1102     Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
2 1103     I'll to my rest.
2 1104                               Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].
2 1105 
2 1106   Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
2 1107 
2 1108   Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
2 1109 
2 1110   Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
2 1111 
2 1112   Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
2 1113 
2 1114   Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
2 1115 
2 1116   Nurse. I know not.
2 1117 
2 1118   Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
2 1119     My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
2 1120 
2 1121   Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
2 1122     The only son of your great enemy.
2 1123 
2 1124   Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
2 1125     Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
2 1126     Prodigious birth of love it is to me
2 1127     That I must love a loathed enemy.
2 1128 
2 1129   Nurse. What's this? what's this?
2 1130 
2 1131   Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
2 1132     Of one I danc'd withal.
2 1133                                      One calls within, 'Juliet.'
2 1134 
2 1135   Nurse. Anon, anon!
2 1136     Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.
2 1137 
2 1138 
2 1139 
2 1140 
2 1141 PROLOGUE
2 1142 
2 1143 Enter Chorus.
2 1144 
2 1145 
2 1146   Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
2 1147     And young affection gapes to be his heir;
2 1148     That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
2 1149     With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
2 1150     Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
2 1151     Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
2 1152     But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
2 1153     And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
2 1154     Being held a foe, he may not have access
2 1155     To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
2 1156     And she as much in love, her means much less
2 1157     To meet her new beloved anywhere;
2 1158     But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
2 1159     Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
2 1160 Exit.

2 1165 ACT II. Scene I.
2 1166 A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
2 1167 
2 1168 Enter Romeo alone.
2 1169 
2 1170 
2 1171   Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
2 1172     Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
2 1173                      [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
2 1174 
2 1175                    Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.
2 1176 
2 1177 
2 1178   Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
2 1179 
2 1180   Mer. He is wise,
2 1181     And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
2 1182 
2 1183   Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
2 1184     Call, good Mercutio.
2 1185 
2 1186   Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
2 1187     Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
2 1188     Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
2 1189     Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
2 1190     Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
2 1191     Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
2 1192     One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
2 1193     Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
2 1194     When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
2 1195     He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
2 1196     The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
2 1197     I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
2 1198     By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
2 1199     By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
2 1200     And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
2 1201     That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
2 1202 
2 1203   Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
2 1204 
2 1205   Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
2 1206     To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
2 1207     Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
2 1208     Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
2 1209     That were some spite; my invocation
2 1210     Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
2 1211     I conjure only but to raise up him.
2 1212 
2 1213   Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
2 1214     To be consorted with the humorous night.
2 1215     Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
2 1216 
2 1217   Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
2 1218     Now will he sit under a medlar tree
2 1219     And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
2 1220     As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
2 1221     O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
2 1222     An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
2 1223     Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
2 1224     This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
2 1225     Come, shall we go?
2 1226 
2 1227   Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
2 1228     'To seek him here that means not to be found.
2 1229                                                          Exeunt.

2 1233 
2 1234 Scene II.
2 1235 Capulet's orchard.
2 1236 
2 1237 Enter Romeo.
2 1238 
2 1239 
2 1240   Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
2 1241 
2 1242                      Enter Juliet above at a window.
2 1243 
2 1244     But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
2 1245     It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
2 1246     Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
2 1247     Who is already sick and pale with grief
2 1248     That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
2 1249     Be not her maid, since she is envious.
2 1250     Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
2 1251     And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
2 1252     It is my lady; O, it is my love!
2 1253     O that she knew she were!
2 1254     She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
2 1255     Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
2 1256     I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
2 1257     Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
2 1258     Having some business, do entreat her eyes
2 1259     To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
2 1260     What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
2 1261     The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
2 1262     As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
2 1263     Would through the airy region stream so bright
2 1264     That birds would sing and think it were not night.
2 1265     See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
2 1266     O that I were a glove upon that hand,
2 1267     That I might touch that cheek!
2 1268 
2 1269   Jul. Ay me!
2 1270 
2 1271   Rom. She speaks.
2 1272     O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
2 1273     As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
2 1274     As is a winged messenger of heaven
2 1275     Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
2 1276     Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
2 1277     When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
2 1278     And sails upon the bosom of the air.
2 1279 
2 1280   Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
2 1281     Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
2 1282     Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
2 1283     And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
2 1284 
2 1285   Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
2 1286 
2 1287   Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
2 1288     Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
2 1289     What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
2 1290     Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
2 1291     Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
2 1292     What's in a name? That which we call a rose
2 1293     By any other name would smell as sweet.
2 1294     So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
2 1295     Retain that dear perfection which he owes
2 1296     Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
2 1297     And for that name, which is no part of thee,
2 1298     Take all myself.
2 1299 
2 1300   Rom. I take thee at thy word.
2 1301     Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
2 1302     Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
2 1303 
2 1304   Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
2 1305     So stumblest on my counsel?
2 1306 
2 1307   Rom. By a name
2 1308     I know not how to tell thee who I am.
2 1309     My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
2 1310     Because it is an enemy to thee.
2 1311     Had I it written, I would tear the word.
2 1312 
2 1313   Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
2 1314     Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
2 1315     Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
2 1316 
2 1317   Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
2 1318 
2 1319   Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
2 1320     The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
2 1321     And the place death, considering who thou art,
2 1322     If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
2 1323 
2 1324   Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
2 1325     For stony limits cannot hold love out,
2 1326     And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
2 1327     Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
2 1328 
2 1329   Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
2 1330 
2 1331   Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
2 1332     Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
2 1333     And I am proof against their enmity.
2 1334 
2 1335   Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
2 1336 
2 1337   Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
2 1338     And but thou love me, let them find me here.
2 1339     My life were better ended by their hate
2 1340     Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
2 1341 
2 1342   Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
2 1343 
2 1344   Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
2 1345     He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
2 1346     I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
2 1347     As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
2 1348     I would adventure for such merchandise.
2 1349 
2 1350   Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
2 1351     Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
2 1352     For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
2 1353     Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
2 1354     What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
2 1355     Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
2 1356     And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
2 1357     Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
2 1358     They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
2 1359     If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
2 1360     Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
2 1361     I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
2 1362     So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
2 1363     In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
2 1364     And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
2 1365     But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
2 1366     Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
2 1367     I should have been more strange, I must confess,
2 1368     But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
2 1369     My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
2 1370     And not impute this yielding to light love,
2 1371     Which the dark night hath so discovered.
2 1372 
2 1373   Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
2 1374     That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
2 1375 
2 1376   Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
2 1377     That monthly changes in her circled orb,
2 1378     Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
2 1379 
2 1380   Rom. What shall I swear by?
2 1381 
2 1382   Jul. Do not swear at all;
2 1383     Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
2 1384     Which is the god of my idolatry,
2 1385     And I'll believe thee.
2 1386 
2 1387   Rom. If my heart's dear love-
2 1388 
2 1389   Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
2 1390     I have no joy of this contract to-night.
2 1391     It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
2 1392     Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
2 1393     Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
2 1394     This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
2 1395     May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
2 1396     Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
2 1397     Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
2 1398 
2 1399   Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
2 1400 
2 1401   Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
2 1402 
2 1403   Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
2 1404 
2 1405   Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
2 1406     And yet I would it were to give again.
2 1407 
2 1408   Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
2 1409 
2 1410   Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
2 1411     And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
2 1412     My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
2 1413     My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
2 1414     The more I have, for both are infinite.
2 1415     I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
2 1416                                            [Nurse] calls within.
2 1417     Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
2 1418     Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]
2 1419 
2 1420   Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
2 1421     Being in night, all this is but a dream,
2 1422     Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
2 1423 
2 1424                        Enter Juliet above.
2 1425 
2 1426 
2 1427   Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
2 1428     If that thy bent of love be honourable,
2 1429     Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
2 1430     By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
2 1431     Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
2 1432     And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
2 1433     And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
2 1434 
2 1435   Nurse. (within) Madam!
2 1436 
2 1437   Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
2 1438     I do beseech thee-
2 1439 
2 1440   Nurse. (within) Madam!
2 1441 
2 1442   Jul. By-and-by I come.-
2 1443     To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
2 1444     To-morrow will I send.
2 1445 
2 1446   Rom. So thrive my soul-
2 1447 
2 1448   Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.
2 1449 
2 1450   Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
2 1451     Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
2 1452     But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
2 1453 
2 1454                      Enter Juliet again, [above].
2 1455 
2 1456 
2 1457   Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
2 1458     To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
2 1459     Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
2 1460     Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
2 1461     And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
2 1462     With repetition of my Romeo's name.
2 1463     Romeo!
2 1464 
2 1465   Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
2 1466     How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
2 1467     Like softest music to attending ears!
2 1468 
2 1469   Jul. Romeo!
2 1470 
2 1471   Rom. My dear?
2 1472 
2 1473   Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
2 1474     Shall I send to thee?
2 1475 
2 1476   Rom. By the hour of nine.
2 1477 
2 1478   Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
2 1479     I have forgot why I did call thee back.
2 1480 
2 1481   Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
2 1482 
2 1483   Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
2 1484     Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
2 1485 
2 1486   Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
2 1487     Forgetting any other home but this.
2 1488 
2 1489   Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
2 1490     And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
2 1491     That lets it hop a little from her hand,
2 1492     Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
2 1493     And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
2 1494     So loving-jealous of his liberty.
2 1495 
2 1496   Rom. I would I were thy bird.
2 1497 
2 1498   Jul. Sweet, so would I.
2 1499     Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
2 1500     Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
2 1501     That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
2 1502                                                          [Exit.]
2 1503 
2 1504   Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
2 1505     Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
2 1506     Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
2 1507     His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
2 1508  Exit
2 1509 
2 1510 
2 1511 
2 1512 
2 1513 Scene III.
2 1514 Friar Laurence's cell.
2 1515 
2 1516 Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.
2 1517 
2 1518 
2 1519   Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
2 1520     Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
2 1521     And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
2 1522     From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
2 1523     Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
2 1524     The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
2 1525     I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
2 1526     With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
2 1527     The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
2 1528     What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
2 1529     And from her womb children of divers kind
2 1530     We sucking on her natural bosom find;
2 1531     Many for many virtues excellent,
2 1532     None but for some, and yet all different.
2 1533     O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
2 1534     In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
2 1535     For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
2 1536     But to the earth some special good doth give;
2 1537     Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
2 1538     Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
2 1539     Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
2 1540     And vice sometime's by action dignified.
2 1541     Within the infant rind of this small flower
2 1542     Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
2 1543     For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
2 1544     Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
2 1545     Two such opposed kings encamp them still
2 1546     In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
2 1547     And where the worser is predominant,
2 1548     Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
2 1549 
2 1550                         Enter Romeo.
2 1551 
2 1552 
2 1553   Rom. Good morrow, father.
2 1554 
2 1555   Friar. Benedicite!
2 1556     What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
2 1557     Young son, it argues a distempered head
2 1558     So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
2 1559     Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
2 1560     And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
2 1561     But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
2 1562     Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
2 1563     Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
2 1564     Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
2 1565     Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
2 1566     Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
2 1567 
2 1568   Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
2 1569 
2 1570   Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
2 1571 
2 1572   Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
2 1573     I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
2 1574 
2 1575   Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
2 1576 
2 1577   Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
2 1578     I have been feasting with mine enemy,
2 1579     Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
2 1580     That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
2 1581     Within thy help and holy physic lies.
2 1582     I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
2 1583     My intercession likewise steads my foe.
2 1584 
2 1585   Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
2 1586     Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
2 1587 
2 1588   Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
2 1589     On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
2 1590     As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
2 1591     And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
2 1592     By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
2 1593     We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
2 1594     I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
2 1595     That thou consent to marry us to-day.
2 1596 
2 1597   Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
2 1598     Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
2 1599     So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
2 1600     Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
2 1601     Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
2 1602     Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
2 1603     How much salt water thrown away in waste,
2 1604     To season love, that of it doth not taste!
2 1605     The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
2 1606     Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
2 1607     Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
2 1608     Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
2 1609     If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
2 1610     Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
2 1611     And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
2 1612     Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
2 1613 
2 1614   Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
2 1615 
2 1616   Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
2 1617 
2 1618   Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
2 1619 
2 1620   Friar. Not in a grave
2 1621     To lay one in, another out to have.
2 1622 
2 1623   Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
2 1624     Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
2 1625     The other did not so.
2 1626 
2 1627   Friar. O, she knew well
2 1628     Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
2 1629     But come, young waverer, come go with me.
2 1630     In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
2 1631     For this alliance may so happy prove
2 1632     To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
2 1633 
2 1634   Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
2 1635 
2 1636   Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
2 1637                                                          Exeunt.
2 1638 
2 1639 
2 1640 
2 1641 
2 1642 Scene IV.
2 1643 A street.
2 1644 
2 1645 Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
2 1646 
2 1647 
2 1648   Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
2 1649     Came he not home to-night?
2 1650 
2 1651   Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
2 1652 
2 1653   Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
2 1654     Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
2 1655 
2 1656   Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
2 1657     Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
2 1658 
2 1659   Mer. A challenge, on my life.
2 1660 
2 1661   Ben. Romeo will answer it.
2 1662 
2 1663   Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.
2 1664 
2 1665   Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
2 1666     being dared.
2 1667 
2 1668   Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
2 1669     wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
2 1670     very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
2 1671     butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
2 1672 
2 1673   Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?
2 1674 
2 1675   Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
2 1676     courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
2 1677     pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
2 1678     minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
2 1679     butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
2 1680     of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
2 1681     immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.
2 1682 
2 1683   Ben. The what?
2 1684 
2 1685   Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
2 1686     these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
2 1687     tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
2 1688     grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
2 1689     flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
2 1690     so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
2 1691     bench? O, their bones, their bones!
2 1692 
2 1693                                Enter Romeo.
2 1694 
2 1695 
2 1696   Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
2 1697 
2 1698   Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
2 1699     art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
2 1700     flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
2 1701     had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
2 1702     Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
2 1703     but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
2 1704     salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
2 1705     fairly last night.
2 1706 
2 1707   Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
2 1708 
2 1709   Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
2 1710 
2 1711   Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
2 1712     case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
2 1713 
2 1714   Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
2 1715     man to bow in the hams.
2 1716 
2 1717   Rom. Meaning, to cursy.
2 1718 
2 1719   Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.
2 1720 
2 1721   Rom. A most courteous exposition.
2 1722 
2 1723   Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
2 1724 
2 1725   Rom. Pink for flower.
2 1726 
2 1727   Mer. Right.
2 1728 
2 1729   Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
2 1730 
2 1731   Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
2 1732     thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
2 1733     remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
2 1734 
2 1735   Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
2 1736 
2 1737   Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
2 1738 
2 1739   Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
2 1740 
2 1741   Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
2 1742     thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
2 1743     sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
2 1744 
2 1745   Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
2 1746     there for the goose.
2 1747 
2 1748   Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
2 1749 
2 1750   Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!
2 1751 
2 1752   Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
2 1753 
2 1754   Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
2 1755 
2 1756   Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
2 1757     narrow to an ell broad!
2 1758 
2 1759   Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
2 1760     the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
2 1761 
2 1762   Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
2 1763     art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
2 1764     art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
2 1765     great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
2 1766     a hole.
2 1767 
2 1768   Ben. Stop there, stop there!
2 1769 
2 1770   Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
2 1771 
2 1772   Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
2 1773 
2 1774   Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
2 1775     was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
2 1776     occupy the argument no longer.
2 1777 
2 1778   Rom. Here's goodly gear!
2 1779 
2 1780                       Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].
2 1781 
2 1782 
2 1783   Mer. A sail, a sail!
2 1784 
2 1785   Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
2 1786 
2 1787   Nurse. Peter!
2 1788 
2 1789   Peter. Anon.
2 1790 
2 1791   Nurse. My fan, Peter.
2 1792 
2 1793   Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
2 1794     the two.
2 1795 
2 1796   Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
2 1797 
2 1798   Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
2 1799 
2 1800   Nurse. Is it good-den?
2 1801 
2 1802   Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
2 1803     now upon the prick of noon.
2 1804 
2 1805   Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
2 1806 
2 1807   Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
2 1808 
2 1809   Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
2 1810     quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the
2 1811     young Romeo?
2 1812 
2 1813   Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
2 1814     have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
2 1815     of that name, for fault of a worse.
2 1816 
2 1817   Nurse. You say well.
2 1818 
2 1819   Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
2 1820     wisely.
2 1821 
2 1822   Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
2 1823 
2 1824   Ben. She will endite him to some supper.
2 1825 
2 1826   Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
2 1827 
2 1828   Rom. What hast thou found?
2 1829 
2 1830   Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
2 1831     something stale and hoar ere it be spent
2 1832                                      He walks by them and sings.
2 1833 
2 1834                    An old hare hoar,
2 1835                    And an old hare hoar,
2 1836                 Is very good meat in Lent;
2 1837                    But a hare that is hoar
2 1838                    Is too much for a score
2 1839                 When it hoars ere it be spent.
2 1840 
2 1841     Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
2 1842 
2 1843   Rom. I will follow you.
2 1844 
2 1845   Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
2 1846     [sings] lady, lady, lady.
2 1847                                       Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.
2 1848 
2 1849   Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
2 1850     was this that was so full of his ropery?
2 1851 
2 1852   Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
2 1853     will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
2 1854 
2 1855   Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
2 1856 'a
2 1857     were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,
2 1858     I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
2 1859     flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
2 1860     stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
2 1861 
2 1862   Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
2 1863     weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
2 1864     soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
2 1865     law on my side.
2 1866 
2 1867   Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
2 1868     quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
2 1869     my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I
2 1870     will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
2 1871     her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
2 1872     behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
2 1873     therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
2 1874     an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
2 1875 
2 1876   Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
2 1877     thee-
2 1878 
2 1879   Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
2 1880     Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
2 1881 
2 1882   Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
2 1883 
2 1884   Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
2 1885     take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
2 1886 
2 1887   Rom. Bid her devise
2 1888     Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
2 1889     And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
2 1890     Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
2 1891 
2 1892   Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
2 1893 
2 1894   Rom. Go to! I say you shall.
2 1895 
2 1896   Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
2 1897 
2 1898   Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
2 1899     Within this hour my man shall be with thee
2 1900     And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
2 1901     Which to the high topgallant of my joy
2 1902     Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2 1903     Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
2 1904     Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
2 1905 
2 1906   Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
2 1907 
2 1908   Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
2 1909 
2 1910   Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
2 1911     Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
2 1912 
2 1913   Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
2 1914 
2 1915   Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
2 1916     when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
2 1917     town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,
2 1918     good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I
2 1919     anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
2 1920     but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
2 1921     clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
2 1922     with a letter?
2 1923 
2 1924   Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
2 1925 
2 1926   Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
2 1927     know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
2 1928     sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
2 1929     good to hear it.
2 1930 
2 1931   Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
2 1932 
2 1933   Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
2 1934 
2 1935   Peter. Anon.
2 1936 
2 1937   Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
2 1938                                                          Exeunt.
2 1939 
2 1940 
2 1941 
2 1942 
2 1943 Scene V.
2 1944 Capulet's orchard.
2 1945 
2 1946 Enter Juliet.
2 1947 
2 1948 
2 1949   Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
2 1950     In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
2 1951     Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
2 1952     O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
2 1953     Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
2 1954     Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
2 1955     Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
2 1956     And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2 1957     Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2 1958     Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
2 1959     Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
2 1960     Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2 1961     She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
2 1962     My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2 1963     And his to me,
2 1964     But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
2 1965     Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
2 1966 
2 1967                       Enter Nurse [and Peter].
2 1968 
2 1969     O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
2 1970     Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
2 1971 
2 1972   Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
2 1973                                                    [Exit Peter.]
2 1974 
2 1975   Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
2 1976     Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
2 1977     If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
2 1978     By playing it to me with so sour a face.
2 1979 
2 1980   Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
2 1981     Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
2 1982 
2 1983   Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
2 1984     Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
2 1985 
2 1986   Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
2 1987     Do you not see that I am out of breath?
2 1988 
2 1989   Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
2 1990     To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2 1991     The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2 1992     Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2 1993     Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
2 1994     Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
2 1995     Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
2 1996 
2 1997   Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
2 1998     choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
2 1999     than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
2 2000     foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
2 2001     they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
2 2002     warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
2 2003 God.
2 2004     What, have you din'd at home?
2 2005 
2 2006   Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
2 2007     What says he of our marriage? What of that?
2 2008 
2 2009   Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
2 2010     It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2 2011     My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
2 2012     Beshrew your heart for sending me about
2 2013     To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
2 2014 
2 2015   Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2 2016     Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
2 2017 
2 2018   Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
2 2019     and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
2 2020     is your mother?
2 2021 
2 2022   Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
2 2023     Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
2 2024     'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2 2025     "Where is your mother?"'
2 2026 
2 2027   Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
2 2028     Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
2 2029     Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2 2030     Henceforward do your messages yourself.
2 2031 
2 2032   Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
2 2033 
2 2034   Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
2 2035 
2 2036   Jul. I have.
2 2037 
2 2038   Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
2 2039     There stays a husband to make you a wife.
2 2040     Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
2 2041     They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2 2042     Hie you to church; I must another way,
2 2043     To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
2 2044     Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
2 2045     I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
2 2046     But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
2 2047     Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
2 2048 
2 2049   Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
2 2050                                                          Exeunt.

2 2059 
2 2060 
2 2061   Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
2 2062     That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
2 2063 
2 2064   Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
2 2065     It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2 2066     That one short minute gives me in her sight.
2 2067     Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2 2068     Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
2 2069     It is enough I may but call her mine.
2 2070 
2 2071   Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
2 2072     And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
2 2073     Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
2 2074     Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
2 2075     And in the taste confounds the appetite.
2 2076     Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
2 2077     Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
2 2078 
2 2079                      Enter Juliet.
2 2080 
2 2081     Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
2 2082     Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
2 2083     A lover may bestride the gossamer
2 2084     That idles in the wanton summer air,
2 2085     And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
2 2086 
2 2087   Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
2 2088 
2 2089   Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
2 2090 
2 2091   Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
2 2092 
2 2093   Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2 2094     Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
2 2095     To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2 2096     This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
2 2097     Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
2 2098     Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2 2099 
2 2100   Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2 2101     Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
2 2102     They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2 2103     But my true love is grown to such excess
2 2104     cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2 2105 
2 2106   Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2 2107     For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2 2108     Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
2 2109                                                        [Exeunt.]

2 2112 
2 2113 
2 2114 ACT III. Scene I.
2 2115 A public place.
2 2116 
2 2117 Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.
2 2118 
2 2119 
2 2120   Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
2 2121     The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
2 2122     And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
2 2123     For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2 2124 
2 2125   Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
2 2126     the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
2 2127     says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the
2 2128     second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
2 2129 
2 2130   Ben. Am I like such a fellow?
2 2131 
2 2132   Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
2 2133     Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
2 2134     moved.
2 2135 
2 2136   Ben. And what to?
2 2137 
2 2138   Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
2 2139     for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a
2 2140     man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
2 2141     Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2 2142     other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
2 2143     eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
2 2144     as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
2 2145     addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a
2 2146     man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
2 2147     that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
2 2148     tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
2 2149     another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
2 2150     tutor me from quarrelling!
2 2151 
2 2152   Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
2 2153     buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
2 2154 
2 2155   Mer. The fee simple? O simple!
2 2156 
2 2157                        Enter Tybalt and others.
2 2158 
2 2159 
2 2160   Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.
2 2161 
2 2162   Mer. By my heel, I care not.
2 2163 
2 2164   Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2 2165     Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
2 2166 
2 2167   Mer. And but one word with one of us?
2 2168     Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
2 2169 
2 2170   Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
2 2171     occasion.
2 2172 
2 2173   Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving
2 2174 
2 2175   Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
2 2176 
2 2177   Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
2 2178     minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
2 2179     fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
2 2180 
2 2181   Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
2 2182     Either withdraw unto some private place
2 2183     And reason coldly of your grievances,
2 2184     Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
2 2185 
2 2186   Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
2 2187     I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
2 2188 
2 2189                         Enter Romeo.
2 2190 
2 2191 
2 2192   Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
2 2193 
2 2194   Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
2 2195     Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
2 2196     Your worship in that sense may call him man.
2 2197 
2 2198   Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
2 2199     No better term than this: thou art a villain.
2 2200 
2 2201   Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2 2202     Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2 2203     To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
2 2204     Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
2 2205 
2 2206   Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2 2207     That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2 2208 
2 2209   Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
2 2210     But love thee better than thou canst devise
2 2211     Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
2 2212     And so good Capulet, which name I tender
2 2213     As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
2 2214 
2 2215   Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2 2216     Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
2 2217     Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
2 2218 
2 2219   Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?
2 2220 
2 2221   Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
2 2222 That I
2 2223     mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,
2 2224 
2 2225     dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out
2 2226     of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
2 2227     ears ere it be out.
2 2228 
2 2229   Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
2 2230 
2 2231   Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2 2232 
2 2233   Mer. Come, sir, your passado!
2 2234                                                    [They fight.]
2 2235 
2 2236   Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2 2237     Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
2 2238     Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
2 2239     Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
2 2240     Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
2 2241          Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
2 2242                                            [with his Followers].
2 2243 
2 2244   Mer. I am hurt.
2 2245     A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2 2246     Is he gone and hath nothing?
2 2247 
2 2248   Ben. What, art thou hurt?
2 2249 
2 2250   Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
2 2251     Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2 2252                                                     [Exit Page.]
2 2253 
2 2254   Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
2 2255 
2 2256   Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
2 2257     but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
2 2258     shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
2 2259     world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
2 2260     mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
2 2261 a
2 2262     villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
2 2263     came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
2 2264 
2 2265   Rom. I thought all for the best.
2 2266 
2 2267   Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2 2268     Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2 2269     They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
2 2270     And soundly too. Your houses!
2 2271                                  [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].
2 2272 
2 2273   Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
2 2274     My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
2 2275     In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
2 2276     With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
2 2277     Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
2 2278     Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2 2279     And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
2 2280 
2 2281                       Enter Benvolio.
2 2282 
2 2283 
2 2284   Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2 2285     That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
2 2286     Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2 2287 
2 2288   Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
2 2289     This but begins the woe others must end.
2 2290 
2 2291                        Enter Tybalt.
2 2292 
2 2293 
2 2294   Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2 2295 
2 2296   Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
2 2297     Away to heaven respective lenity,
2 2298     And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
2 2299     Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
2 2300     That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2 2301     Is but a little way above our heads,
2 2302     Staying for thine to keep him company.
2 2303     Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
2 2304 
2 2305   Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2 2306     Shalt with him hence.
2 2307 
2 2308   Rom. This shall determine that.
2 2309                                        They fight. Tybalt falls.
2 2310 
2 2311   Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
2 2312     The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2 2313     Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
2 2314     If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
2 2315 
2 2316   Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
2 2317 
2 2318   Ben. Why dost thou stay?
2 2319                                                      Exit Romeo.
2 2320                       Enter Citizens.
2 2321 
2 2322 
2 2323   Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2 2324     Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?
2 2325 
2 2326   Ben. There lies that Tybalt.
2 2327 
2 2328   Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
2 2329     I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
2 2330 
2 2331 
2 2332   Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
2 2333                      and [others].
2 2334 
2 2335 
2 2336   Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2 2337 
2 2338   Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
2 2339     The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
2 2340     There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2 2341     That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2 2342 
2 2343   Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2 2344     O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
2 2345     Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2 2346     For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
2 2347     O cousin, cousin!
2 2348 
2 2349   Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2 2350 
2 2351   Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
2 2352     Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
2 2353     How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
2 2354     Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
2 2355     With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
2 2356     Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2 2357     Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2 2358     With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
2 2359     Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2 2360     And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2 2361     Cold death aside and with the other sends
2 2362     It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
2 2363     Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
2 2364     'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
2 2365     His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2 2366     And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2 2367     An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2 2368     Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2 2369     But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
2 2370     Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2 2371     And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
2 2372     Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
2 2373     And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2 2374     This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2 2375 
2 2376   Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2 2377     Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
2 2378     Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2 2379     And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2 2380     I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
2 2381     Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
2 2382 
2 2383   Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
2 2384     Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2 2385 
2 2386   Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
2 2387     His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2 2388     The life of Tybalt.
2 2389 
2 2390   Prince. And for that offence
2 2391     Immediately we do exile him hence.
2 2392     I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2 2393     My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2 2394     But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2 2395     That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
2 2396     I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2 2397     Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
2 2398     Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
2 2399     Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
2 2400     Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
2 2401     Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2 2402                                                          Exeunt.

2 2407 Scene II.
2 2408 Capulet's orchard.
2 2409 
2 2410 Enter Juliet alone.
2 2411 
2 2412 
2 2413   Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2 2414     Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
2 2415     As Phaeton would whip you to the West
2 2416     And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2 2417     Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2 2418     That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
2 2419     Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
2 2420     Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2 2421     By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2 2422     It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2 2423     Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2 2424     And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2 2425     Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
2 2426     Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2 2427     With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
2 2428     Think true love acted simple modesty.
2 2429     Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2 2430     For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2 2431     Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
2 2432     Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
2 2433     Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2 2434     Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2 2435     And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2 2436     That all the world will be in love with night
2 2437     And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2 2438     O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2 2439     But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
2 2440     Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
2 2441     As is the night before some festival
2 2442     To an impatient child that hath new robes
2 2443     And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2 2444 
2 2445                 Enter Nurse, with cords.
2 2446 
2 2447     And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2 2448     But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2 2449     Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2 2450     That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2 2451 
2 2452   Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
2 2453                                              [Throws them down.]
2 2454 
2 2455   Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
2 2456 
2 2457   Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2 2458     We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2 2459     Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2 2460 
2 2461   Jul. Can heaven be so envious?
2 2462 
2 2463   Nurse. Romeo can,
2 2464     Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
2 2465     Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2 2466 
2 2467   Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
2 2468     This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2 2469     Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
2 2470     And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2 2471     Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
2 2472     I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
2 2473     Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
2 2474     If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
2 2475     Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2 2476 
2 2477   Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
2 2478     (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
2 2479     A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2 2480     Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2 2481     All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
2 2482 
2 2483   Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
2 2484     To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
2 2485     Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
2 2486     And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2 2487 
2 2488   Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2 2489     O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
2 2490     That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2 2491 
2 2492   Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2 2493     Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
2 2494     My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
2 2495     Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2 2496     For who is living, if those two are gone?
2 2497 
2 2498   Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2 2499     Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2 2500 
2 2501   Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2 2502 
2 2503   Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
2 2504 
2 2505   Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
2 2506     Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2 2507     Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2 2508     Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2 2509     Despised substance of divinest show!
2 2510     Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
2 2511     A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2 2512     O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
2 2513     When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2 2514     In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
2 2515     Was ever book containing such vile matter
2 2516     So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
2 2517     In such a gorgeous palace!
2 2518 
2 2519   Nurse. There's no trust,
2 2520     No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
2 2521     All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2 2522     Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
2 2523     These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2 2524     Shame come to Romeo!
2 2525 
2 2526   Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
2 2527     For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
2 2528     Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
2 2529     For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2 2530     Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2 2531     O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2 2532 
2 2533   Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2 2534 
2 2535   Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2 2536     Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
2 2537     When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2 2538     But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2 2539     That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
2 2540     Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
2 2541     Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2 2542     Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2 2543     My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2 2544     And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
2 2545     All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2 2546     Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2 2547     That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
2 2548     But O, it presses to my memory
2 2549     Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
2 2550     'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
2 2551     That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2 2552     Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2 2553     Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
2 2554     Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2 2555     And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2 2556     Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2 2557     Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2 2558     Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
2 2559     But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
2 2560     'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
2 2561     Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2 2562     All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
2 2563     There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2 2564     In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2 2565     Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
2 2566 
2 2567   Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
2 2568     Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2 2569 
2 2570   Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
2 2571     When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2 2572     Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
2 2573     Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
2 2574     He made you for a highway to my bed;
2 2575     But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2 2576     Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
2 2577     And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2 2578 
2 2579   Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
2 2580     To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
2 2581     Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
2 2582     I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2 2583 
2 2584   Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
2 2585     And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2 2586                                                          Exeunt.
2 2587 
2 2588 
2 2589 
2 2590 
2 2591 Scene III.
2 2592 Friar Laurence's cell.
2 2593 
2 2594 Enter Friar [Laurence].
2 2595 
2 2596 
2 2597   Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
2 2598     Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
2 2599     And thou art wedded to calamity.
2 2600 
2 2601                          Enter Romeo.
2 2602 
2 2603 
2 2604   Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
2 2605     What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
2 2606     That I yet know not?
2 2607 
2 2608   Friar. Too familiar
2 2609     Is my dear son with such sour company.
2 2610     I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
2 2611 
2 2612   Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
2 2613 
2 2614   Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
2 2615     Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2 2616 
2 2617   Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
2 2618     For exile hath more terror in his look,
2 2619     Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'
2 2620 
2 2621   Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
2 2622     Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2 2623 
2 2624   Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
2 2625     But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2 2626     Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
2 2627     And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
2 2628     Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
2 2629     Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
2 2630     And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2 2631 
2 2632   Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2 2633     Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
2 2634     Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2 2635     And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
2 2636     This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2 2637 
2 2638   Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
2 2639     Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2 2640     And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2 2641     Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2 2642     But Romeo may not. More validity,
2 2643     More honourable state, more courtship lives
2 2644     In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
2 2645     On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2 2646     And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2 2647     Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
2 2648     Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2 2649     But Romeo may not- he is banished.
2 2650     This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
2 2651     They are free men, but I am banished.
2 2652     And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
2 2653     Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2 2654     No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2 2655     But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
2 2656     O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2 2657     Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
2 2658     Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2 2659     A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2 2660     To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2 2661 
2 2662   Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
2 2663 
2 2664   Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2 2665 
2 2666   Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
2 2667     Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2 2668     To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2 2669 
2 2670   Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2 2671     Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2 2672     Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2 2673     It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
2 2674 
2 2675   Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2 2676 
2 2677   Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2 2678 
2 2679   Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2 2680 
2 2681   Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
2 2682     Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2 2683     An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2 2684     Doting like me, and like me banished,
2 2685     Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2 2686     And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2 2687     Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2 2688                                                  Knock [within].
2 2689 
2 2690   Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
2 2691 
2 2692   Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2 2693     Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.
2 2694 
2 2695   Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2 2696     Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
2 2697     Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
2 2698     What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
2 2699     Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
2 2700 
2 2701   Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
2 2702     I come from Lady Juliet.
2 2703 
2 2704   Friar. Welcome then.
2 2705 
2 2706                        Enter Nurse.
2 2707 
2 2708 
2 2709   Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
2 2710     Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2 2711 
2 2712   Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2 2713 
2 2714   Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2 2715     Just in her case!
2 2716 
2 2717   Friar. O woeful sympathy!
2 2718     Piteous predicament!
2 2719 
2 2720   Nurse. Even so lies she,
2 2721     Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2 2722     Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
2 2723     For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
2 2724     Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2 2725 
2 2726   Rom. (rises) Nurse-
2 2727 
2 2728   Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2 2729 
2 2730   Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
2 2731     Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
2 2732     Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2 2733     With blood remov'd but little from her own?
2 2734     Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
2 2735     My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2 2736 
2 2737   Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2 2738     And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
2 2739     And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2 2740     And then down falls again.
2 2741 
2 2742   Rom. As if that name,
2 2743     Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2 2744     Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
2 2745     Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2 2746     In what vile part of this anatomy
2 2747     Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
2 2748     The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]
2 2749 
2 2750   Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
2 2751     Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
2 2752     Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
2 2753     The unreasonable fury of a beast.
2 2754     Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2 2755     Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2 2756     Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
2 2757     I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2 2758     Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
2 2759     And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
2 2760     By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2 2761     Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2 2762     Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
2 2763     In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2 2764     Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
2 2765     Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2 2766     And usest none in that true use indeed
2 2767     Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
2 2768     Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
2 2769     Digressing from the valour of a man;
2 2770     Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2 2771     Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2 2772     Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2 2773     Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2 2774     Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
2 2775     is get afire by thine own ignorance,
2 2776     And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
2 2777     What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
2 2778     For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
2 2779     There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
2 2780     But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
2 2781     The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
2 2782     And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
2 2783     A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
2 2784     Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2 2785     But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
2 2786     Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
2 2787     Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2 2788     Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2 2789     Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
2 2790     But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2 2791     For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
2 2792     Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
2 2793     To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2 2794     Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
2 2795     With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2 2796     Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2 2797     Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
2 2798     And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2 2799     Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
2 2800     Romeo is coming.
2 2801 
2 2802   Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2 2803     To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
2 2804     My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2 2805 
2 2806   Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2 2807 
2 2808   Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
2 2809     Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.
2 2810 
2 2811   Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
2 2812 
2 2813   Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2 2814     Either be gone before the watch be set,
2 2815     Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
2 2816     Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
2 2817     And he shall signify from time to time
2 2818     Every good hap to you that chances here.
2 2819     Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.
2 2820 
2 2821   Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2 2822     It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
2 2823     Farewell.
2 2824                                                          Exeunt.

2 2829 Scene IV.
2 2830 Capulet's house
2 2831 
2 2832 Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.
2 2833 
2 2834 
2 2835   Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
2 2836     That we have had no time to move our daughter.
2 2837     Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2 2838     And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
2 2839     'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
2 2840     I promise you, but for your company,
2 2841     I would have been abed an hour ago.
2 2842 
2 2843   Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
2 2844     Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
2 2845 
2 2846   Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2 2847     To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
2 2848 
2 2849   Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2 2850     Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
2 2851     In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
2 2852     Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2 2853     Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
2 2854     And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
2 2855     But, soft! what day is this?
2 2856 
2 2857   Par. Monday, my lord.
2 2858 
2 2859   Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
2 2860     Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
2 2861     She shall be married to this noble earl.
2 2862     Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
2 2863     We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
2 2864     For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2 2865     It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2 2866     Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
2 2867     Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2 2868     And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2 2869 
2 2870   Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
2 2871 
2 2872   Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
2 2873     Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
2 2874     Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
2 2875     Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
2 2876     Afore me, It is so very very late
2 2877     That we may call it early by-and-by.
2 2878     Good night.
2 2879                                                           Exeunt

2 2884 Scene V.
2 2885 Capulet's orchard.
2 2886 
2 2887 Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.
2 2888 
2 2889 
2 2890   Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
2 2891     It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2 2892     That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
2 2893     Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
2 2894     Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
2 2895 
2 2896   Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
2 2897     No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
2 2898     Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
2 2899     Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2 2900     Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2 2901     I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
2 2902 
2 2903   Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
2 2904     It is some meteor that the sun exhales
2 2905     To be to thee this night a torchbearer
2 2906     And light thee on the way to Mantua.
2 2907     Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
2 2908 
2 2909   Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
2 2910     I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
2 2911     I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2 2912     'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2 2913     Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
2 2914     The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
2 2915     I have more care to stay than will to go.
2 2916     Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2 2917     How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
2 2918 
2 2919   Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
2 2920     It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2 2921     Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2 2922     Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2 2923     This doth not so, for she divideth us.
2 2924     Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
2 2925     O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
2 2926     Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
2 2927     Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
2 2928     O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
2 2929 
2 2930   Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
2 2931 
2 2932                           Enter Nurse.
2 2933 
2 2934 
2 2935   Nurse. Madam!
2 2936 
2 2937   Jul. Nurse?
2 2938 
2 2939   Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
2 2940     The day is broke; be wary, look about.
2 2941 
2 2942   Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
2 2943                                                          [Exit.]
2 2944 
2 2945   Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
2 2946                                                   He goeth down.
2 2947 
2 2948   Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
2 2949     I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2 2950     For in a minute there are many days.
2 2951     O, by this count I shall be much in years
2 2952     Ere I again behold my Romeo!
2 2953 
2 2954   Rom. Farewell!
2 2955     I will omit no opportunity
2 2956     That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
2 2957 
2 2958   Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
2 2959 
2 2960   Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2 2961     For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2 2962 
2 2963   Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2 2964     Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2 2965     As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
2 2966     Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
2 2967 
2 2968   Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
2 2969     Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2 2970 Exit.
2 2971 
2 2972   Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
2 2973     If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
2 2974     That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
2 2975     For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
2 2976     But send him back.
2 2977 
2 2978   Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
2 2979 
2 2980   Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
2 2981     Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2 2982     What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2 2983 
2 2984                        Enter Mother.
2 2985 
2 2986 
2 2987   Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
2 2988 
2 2989   Jul. Madam, I am not well.
2 2990 
2 2991   Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2 2992     What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2 2993     An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
2 2994     Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
2 2995     But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
2 2996 
2 2997   Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
2 2998 
2 2999   Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2 3000     Which you weep for.
2 3001 
2 3002   Jul. Feeling so the loss,
2 3003     I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
2 3004 
2 3005   Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
2 3006     As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
2 3007 
2 3008   Jul. What villain, madam?
2 3009 
2 3010   Lady. That same villain Romeo.
2 3011 
2 3012   Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
2 3013     God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2 3014     And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
2 3015 
2 3016   Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
2 3017 
2 3018   Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
2 3019     Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
2 3020 
2 3021   Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
2 3022     Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2 3023     Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2 3024     Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
2 3025     That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
2 3026     And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
2 3027 
2 3028   Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
2 3029     With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
2 3030     Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
2 3031     Madam, if you could find out but a man
2 3032     To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2 3033     That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2 3034     Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2 3035     To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
2 3036     To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
2 3037     Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
2 3038 
2 3039   Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2 3040     But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
2 3041 
2 3042   Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
2 3043     What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
2 3044 
2 3045   Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2 3046     One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2 3047     Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
2 3048     That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.
2 3049 
2 3050   Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
2 3051 
2 3052   Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
2 3053     The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
2 3054     The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2 3055     Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
2 3056 
2 3057   Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
2 3058     He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
2 3059     I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
2 3060     Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
2 3061     I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
2 3062     I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
2 3063     It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2 3064     Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
2 3065 
2 3066   Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
2 3067     And see how be will take it at your hands.
2 3068 
2 3069                    Enter Capulet and Nurse.
2 3070 
2 3071 
2 3072   Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
2 3073     But for the sunset of my brother's son
2 3074     It rains downright.
2 3075     How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
2 3076     Evermore show'ring? In one little body
2 3077     Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
2 3078     For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2 3079     Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
2 3080     Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
2 3081     Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
2 3082     Without a sudden calm will overset
2 3083     Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
2 3084     Have you delivered to her our decree?
2 3085 
2 3086   Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2 3087     I would the fool were married to her grave!
2 3088 
2 3089   Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2 3090     How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
2 3091     Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
2 3092     Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2 3093     So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
2 3094 
2 3095   Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
2 3096     Proud can I never be of what I hate,
2 3097     But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
2 3098 
2 3099   Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
2 3100     'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-
2 3101     And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
2 3102     Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
2 3103     But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
2 3104     To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2 3105     Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2 3106     Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
2 3107     You tallow-face!
2 3108 
2 3109   Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
2 3110 
2 3111   Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2 3112     Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
2 3113 
2 3114   Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2 3115     I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
2 3116     Or never after look me in the face.
2 3117     Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
2 3118     My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
2 3119     That God had lent us but this only child;
2 3120     But now I see this one is one too much,
2 3121     And that we have a curse in having her.
2 3122     Out on her, hilding!
2 3123 
2 3124   Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
2 3125     You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
2 3126 
2 3127   Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
2 3128     Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!
2 3129 
2 3130   Nurse. I speak no treason.
2 3131 
2 3132   Cap. O, God-i-god-en!
2 3133 
2 3134   Nurse. May not one speak?
2 3135 
2 3136   Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
2 3137     Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
2 3138     For here we need it not.
2 3139 
2 3140   Lady. You are too hot.
2 3141 
2 3142   Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
2 3143     At home, abroad, alone, in company,
2 3144     Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
2 3145     To have her match'd; and having now provided
2 3146     A gentleman of princely parentage,
2 3147     Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
2 3148     Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
2 3149     Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
2 3150     And then to have a wretched puling fool,
2 3151     A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
2 3152     To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
2 3153     I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
2 3154     But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
2 3155     Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
2 3156     Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
2 3157     Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
2 3158     An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
2 3159     An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
2 3160     For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
2 3161     Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
2 3162     Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.
2 3163 
2 3164   Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
2 3165     That sees into the bottom of my grief?
2 3166     O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
2 3167     Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
2 3168     Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
2 3169     In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
2 3170 
2 3171   Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
2 3172     Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.
2 3173 
2 3174   Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
2 3175     My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
2 3176     How shall that faith return again to earth
2 3177     Unless that husband send it me from heaven
2 3178     By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
2 3179     Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
2 3180     Upon so soft a subject as myself!
2 3181     What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
2 3182     Some comfort, nurse.
2 3183 
2 3184   Nurse. Faith, here it is.
2 3185     Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
2 3186     That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
2 3187     Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2 3188     Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
2 3189     I think it best you married with the County.
2 3190     O, he's a lovely gentleman!
2 3191     Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
2 3192     Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
2 3193     As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
2 3194     I think you are happy in this second match,
2 3195     For it excels your first; or if it did not,
2 3196     Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
2 3197     As living here and you no use of him.
2 3198 
2 3199   Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
2 3200 
2 3201   Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
2 3202 
2 3203   Jul. Amen!
2 3204 
2 3205   Nurse. What?
2 3206 
2 3207   Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
2 3208     Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
2 3209     Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
2 3210     To make confession and to be absolv'd.
2 3211 
2 3212   Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.
2 3213 
2 3214   Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
2 3215     Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
2 3216     Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
2 3217     Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
2 3218     So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
2 3219     Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
2 3220     I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
2 3221     If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.
2 3222 
2 3223 
2 3224 
2 3225 
2 3226 ACT IV. Scene I.
2 3227 Friar Laurence's cell.
2 3228 
2 3229 Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.
2 3230 
2 3231 
2 3232   Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
2 3233 
2 3234   Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
2 3235     And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
2 3236 
2 3237   Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
2 3238     Uneven is the course; I like it not.
2 3239 
2 3240   Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
2 3241     And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
2 3242     For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
2 3243     Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
2 3244     That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
2 3245     And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
2 3246     To stop the inundation of her tears,
2 3247     Which, too much minded by herself alone,
2 3248     May be put from her by society.
2 3249     Now do you know the reason of this haste.
2 3250 
2 3251   Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
2 3252     Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
2 3253 
2 3254                     Enter Juliet.
2 3255 
2 3256 
2 3257   Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
2 3258 
2 3259   Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
2 3260 
2 3261   Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
2 3262 
2 3263   Jul. What must be shall be.
2 3264 
2 3265   Friar. That's a certain text.
2 3266 
2 3267   Par. Come you to make confession to this father?
2 3268 
2 3269   Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
2 3270 
2 3271   Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
2 3272 
2 3273   Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
2 3274 
2 3275   Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
2 3276 
2 3277   Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
2 3278     Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
2 3279 
2 3280   Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
2 3281 
2 3282   Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
2 3283     For it was bad enough before their spite.
2 3284 
2 3285   Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
2 3286 
2 3287   Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
2 3288     And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
2 3289 
2 3290   Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
2 3291 
2 3292   Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
2 3293     Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
2 3294     Or shall I come to you at evening mass
2 3295 
2 3296   Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
2 3297     My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
2 3298 
2 3299   Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
2 3300     Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
2 3301     Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.
2 3302 
2 3303   Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
2 3304     Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!
2 3305 
2 3306   Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
2 3307     It strains me past the compass of my wits.
2 3308     I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
2 3309     On Thursday next be married to this County.
2 3310 
2 3311   Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
2 3312     Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
2 3313     If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
2 3314     Do thou but call my resolution wise
2 3315     And with this knife I'll help it presently.
2 3316     God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
2 3317     And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
2 3318     Shall be the label to another deed,
2 3319     Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
2 3320     Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
2 3321     Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
2 3322     Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
2 3323     'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
2 3324     Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
2 3325     Which the commission of thy years and art
2 3326     Could to no issue of true honour bring.
2 3327     Be not so long to speak. I long to die
2 3328     If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
2 3329 
2 3330   Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
2 3331     Which craves as desperate an execution
2 3332     As that is desperate which we would prevent.
2 3333     If, rather than to marry County Paris
2 3334     Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
2 3335     Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
2 3336     A thing like death to chide away this shame,
2 3337     That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
2 3338     And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
2 3339 
2 3340   Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
2 3341     From off the battlements of yonder tower,
2 3342     Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
2 3343     Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
2 3344     Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
2 3345     O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
2 3346     With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
2 3347     Or bid me go into a new-made grave
2 3348     And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
2 3349     Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
2 3350     And I will do it without fear or doubt,
2 3351     To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
2 3352 
2 3353   Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
2 3354     To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
2 3355     To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
2 3356     Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
2 3357     Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
2 3358     And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
2 3359     When presently through all thy veins shall run
2 3360     A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
2 3361     Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
2 3362     No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
2 3363     The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
2 3364     To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
2 3365     Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
2 3366     Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
2 3367     Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
2 3368     And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
2 3369     Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
2 3370     And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
2 3371     Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
2 3372     To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
2 3373     Then, as the manner of our country is,
2 3374     In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
2 3375     Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
2 3376     Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
2 3377     In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
2 3378     Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
2 3379     And hither shall he come; and he and I
2 3380     Will watch thy waking, and that very night
2 3381     Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
2 3382     And this shall free thee from this present shame,
2 3383     If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
2 3384     Abate thy valour in the acting it.
2 3385 
2 3386   Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
2 3387 
2 3388   Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
2 3389     In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
2 3390     To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
2 3391 
2 3392   Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
2 3393     Farewell, dear father.
2 3394                                                          Exeunt.

2 3398 
2 3399 Scene II.
2 3400 Capulet's house.
2 3401 
2 3402 Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
2 3403                         two or three.
2 3404 
2 3405 
2 3406   Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
2 3407                                             [Exit a Servingman.]
2 3408     Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
2 3409 
2 3410   Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
2 3411     lick their fingers.
2 3412 
2 3413   Cap. How canst thou try them so?
2 3414 
2 3415   Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
2 3416     fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
2 3417     with me.
2 3418 
2 3419   Cap. Go, begone.
2 3420                                                 Exit Servingman.
2 3421     We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
2 3422     What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
2 3423 
2 3424   Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
2 3425 
2 3426   Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
2 3427     A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
2 3428 
2 3429                         Enter Juliet.
2 3430 
2 3431 
2 3432   Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
2 3433 
2 3434   Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
2 3435 
2 3436   Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
2 3437     Of disobedient opposition
2 3438     To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
2 3439     By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
2 3440     To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
2 3441     Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
2 3442 
2 3443   Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
2 3444     I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
2 3445 
2 3446   Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
2 3447     And gave him what becomed love I might,
2 3448     Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
2 3449 
2 3450   Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
2 3451     This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
2 3452     Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
2 3453     Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
2 3454     All our whole city is much bound to him.
2 3455 
2 3456   Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
2 3457     To help me sort such needful ornaments
2 3458     As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
2 3459 
2 3460   Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
2 3461 
2 3462   Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
2 3463                                         Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
2 3464 
2 3465   Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
2 3466     'Tis now near night.
2 3467 
2 3468   Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
2 3469     And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
2 3470     Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
2 3471     I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
2 3472     I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
2 3473     They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
2 3474     To County Paris, to prepare him up
2 3475     Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
2 3476     Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
2 3477                                                          Exeunt.

2 3481 
2 3482 Scene III.
2 3483 Juliet's chamber.
2 3484 
2 3485 Enter Juliet and Nurse.
2 3486 
2 3487 
2 3488   Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
2 3489     I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
2 3490     For I have need of many orisons
2 3491     To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
2 3492     Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
2 3493 
2 3494                           Enter Mother.
2 3495 
2 3496 
2 3497   Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
2 3498 
2 3499   Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
2 3500     As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
2 3501     So please you, let me now be left alone,
2 3502     And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
2 3503     For I am sure you have your hands full all
2 3504     In this so sudden business.
2 3505 
2 3506   Mother. Good night.
2 3507     Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
2 3508                                       Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]
2 3509 
2 3510   Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
2 3511     I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
2 3512     That almost freezes up the heat of life.
2 3513     I'll call them back again to comfort me.
2 3514     Nurse!- What should she do here?
2 3515     My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
2 3516     Come, vial.
2 3517     What if this mixture do not work at all?
2 3518     Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
2 3519     No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
2 3520                                              Lays down a dagger.
2 3521     What if it be a poison which the friar
2 3522     Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
2 3523     Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
2 3524     Because he married me before to Romeo?
2 3525     I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
2 3526     For he hath still been tried a holy man.
2 3527     I will not entertain so bad a thought.
2 3528     How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
2 3529     I wake before the time that Romeo
2 3530     Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
2 3531     Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
2 3532     To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
2 3533     And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
2 3534     Or, if I live, is it not very like
2 3535     The horrible conceit of death and night,
2 3536     Together with the terror of the place-
2 3537     As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
2 3538     Where for this many hundred years the bones
2 3539     Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
2 3540     Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
2 3541     Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
2 3542     At some hours in the night spirits resort-
2 3543     Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
2 3544     So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
2 3545     And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
2 3546     That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
2 3547     O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
2 3548     Environed with all these hideous fears,
2 3549     And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
2 3550     And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
2 3551     And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
2 3552     As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
2 3553     O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
2 3554     Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
2 3555     Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
2 3556     Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
2 3557 
2 3558         She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.
2 3559 
2 3560

2 3563 Scene IV.
2 3564 Capulet's house.
2 3565 
2 3566 Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.
2 3567 
2 3568 
2 3569   Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
2 3570 
2 3571   Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
2 3572 
2 3573                        Enter Old Capulet.
2 3574 
2 3575 
2 3576   Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
2 3577     The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
2 3578     Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
2 3579     Spare not for cost.
2 3580 
2 3581   Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
2 3582     Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
2 3583     For this night's watching.
2 3584 
2 3585   Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
2 3586     All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
2 3587 
2 3588   Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
2 3589     But I will watch you from such watching now.
2 3590                                           Exeunt Lady and Nurse.
2 3591 
2 3592   Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
2 3593 
2 3594 
2 3595   Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.
2 3596 
2 3597     What is there? Now, fellow,
2 3598 
2 3599   Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
2 3600 
2 3601   Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
2 3602       logs.
2 3603     Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
2 3604 
2 3605   Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
2 3606     And never trouble Peter for the matter.
2 3607 
2 3608   Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
2 3609     Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
2 3610     The County will be here with music straight,
2 3611     For so he said he would.                         Play music.
2 3612     I hear him near.
2 3613     Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
2 3614 
2 3615                               Enter Nurse.
2 3616     Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
2 3617     I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
2 3618     Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
2 3619     Make haste, I say.
2 3620                                                        [Exeunt.]

2 3624 
2 3625 Scene V.
2 3626 Juliet's chamber.
2 3627 
2 3628 [Enter Nurse.]
2 3629 
2 3630 
2 3631   Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
2 3632     Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
2 3633     Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
2 3634     What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
2 3635     Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
2 3636     The County Paris hath set up his rest
2 3637     That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
2 3638     Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
2 3639     I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
2 3640     Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
2 3641     He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
2 3642                                      [Draws aside the curtains.]
2 3643     What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
2 3644     I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
2 3645     Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
2 3646     O weraday that ever I was born!
2 3647     Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
2 3648 
2 3649                            Enter Mother.
2 3650 
2 3651 
2 3652   Mother. What noise is here?
2 3653 
2 3654   Nurse. O lamentable day!
2 3655 
2 3656   Mother. What is the matter?
2 3657 
2 3658   Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
2 3659 
2 3660   Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
2 3661     Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
2 3662     Help, help! Call help.
2 3663 
2 3664                             Enter Father.
2 3665 
2 3666 
2 3667   Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
2 3668 
2 3669   Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
2 3670 
2 3671   Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
2 3672 
2 3673   Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
2 3674     Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
2 3675     Life and these lips have long been separated.
2 3676     Death lies on her like an untimely frost
2 3677     Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
2 3678 
2 3679   Nurse. O lamentable day!
2 3680 
2 3681   Mother. O woful time!
2 3682 
2 3683   Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
2 3684     Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
2 3685 
2 3686 
2 3687   Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
2 3688 
2 3689 
2 3690   Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
2 3691 
2 3692   Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
2 3693     O son, the night before thy wedding day
2 3694     Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
2 3695     Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
2 3696     Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
2 3697     My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
2 3698     And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
2 3699 
2 3700   Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
2 3701     And doth it give me such a sight as this?
2 3702 
2 3703   Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
2 3704     Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
2 3705     In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
2 3706     But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
2 3707     But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
2 3708     And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
2 3709 
2 3710   Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
2 3711     Most lamentable day, most woful day
2 3712     That ever ever I did yet behold!
2 3713     O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
2 3714     Never was seen so black a day as this.
2 3715     O woful day! O woful day!
2 3716 
2 3717   Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
2 3718     Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
2 3719     By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
2 3720     O love! O life! not life, but love in death
2 3721 
2 3722   Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
2 3723     Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
2 3724     To murther, murther our solemnity?
2 3725     O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
2 3726     Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
2 3727     And with my child my joys are buried!
2 3728 
2 3729   Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
2 3730     In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
2 3731     Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
2 3732     And all the better is it for the maid.
2 3733     Your part in her you could not keep from death,
2 3734     But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
2 3735     The most you sought was her promotion,
2 3736     For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
2 3737     And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
2 3738     Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
2 3739     O, in this love, you love your child so ill
2 3740     That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
2 3741     She's not well married that lives married long,
2 3742     But she's best married that dies married young.
2 3743     Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
2 3744     On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
2 3745     In all her best array bear her to church;
2 3746     For though fond nature bids us all lament,
2 3747     Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
2 3748 
2 3749   Cap. All things that we ordained festival
2 3750     Turn from their office to black funeral-
2 3751     Our instruments to melancholy bells,
2 3752     Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
2 3753     Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
2 3754     Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
2 3755     And all things change them to the contrary.
2 3756 
2 3757   Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
2 3758     And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
2 3759     To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
2 3760     The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
2 3761     Move them no more by crossing their high will.
2 3762                            Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
2 3763   1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
2 3764 
2 3765   Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
2 3766     For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]
2 3767   1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
2 3768 
2 3769                          Enter Peter.
2 3770 
2 3771 
2 3772   Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
2 3773     O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
2 3774   1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',
2 3775 
2 3776   Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
2 3777     full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
2 3778   1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.
2 3779 
2 3780   Pet. You will not then?
2 3781   1. Mus. No.
2 3782 
2 3783   Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
2 3784   1. Mus. What will you give us?
2 3785 
2 3786   Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
2 3787      minstrel.
2 3788   1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.
2 3789 
2 3790   Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
2 3791     I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
2 3792     note me?
2 3793   1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
2 3794   2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
2 3795 
2 3796   Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
2 3797     iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
2 3798 
2 3799            'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
2 3800              And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
2 3801            Then music with her silver sound'-
2 3802 
2 3803     Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
2 3804     What say you, Simon Catling?
2 3805   1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
2 3806 
2 3807   Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
2 3808   2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
2 3809 
2 3810   Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
2 3811   3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.
2 3812 
2 3813   Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
2 3814     is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
2 3815     gold for sounding.
2 3816 
2 3817            'Then music with her silver sound
2 3818              With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.
2 3819 
2 3820   1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
2 3821   2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the
2 3822     mourners, and stay dinner.
2 3823                                                          Exeunt.

2 3828 ACT V. Scene I.
2 3829 Mantua. A street.
2 3830 
2 3831 Enter Romeo.
2 3832 
2 3833 
2 3834   Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
2 3835     My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
2 3836     My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
2 3837     And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
2 3838     Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
2 3839     I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
2 3840     (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
2 3841     And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
2 3842     That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
2 3843     Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
2 3844     When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
2 3845 
2 3846                 Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.
2 3847 
2 3848     News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
2 3849     Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
2 3850     How doth my lady? Is my father well?
2 3851     How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
2 3852     For nothing can be ill if she be well.
2 3853 
2 3854   Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
2 3855     Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
2 3856     And her immortal part with angels lives.
2 3857     I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
2 3858     And presently took post to tell it you.
2 3859     O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
2 3860     Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
2 3861 
2 3862   Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
2 3863     Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
2 3864     And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
2 3865 
2 3866   Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
2 3867     Your looks are pale and wild and do import
2 3868     Some misadventure.
2 3869 
2 3870   Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
2 3871     Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
2 3872     Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
2 3873 
2 3874   Man. No, my good lord.
2 3875 
2 3876   Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
2 3877     And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
2 3878                                                Exit [Balthasar].
2 3879     Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
2 3880     Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
2 3881     To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
2 3882     I do remember an apothecary,
2 3883     And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
2 3884     In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
2 3885     Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
2 3886     Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
2 3887     And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
2 3888     An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
2 3889     Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
2 3890     A beggarly account of empty boxes,
2 3891     Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
2 3892     Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
2 3893     Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
2 3894     Noting this penury, to myself I said,
2 3895     'An if a man did need a poison now
2 3896     Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
2 3897     Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
2 3898     O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
2 3899     And this same needy man must sell it me.
2 3900     As I remember, this should be the house.
2 3901     Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!
2 3902 
2 3903                         Enter Apothecary.
2 3904 
2 3905 
2 3906   Apoth. Who calls so loud?
2 3907 
2 3908   Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
2 3909     Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
2 3910     A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
2 3911     As will disperse itself through all the veins
2 3912     That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
2 3913     And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
2 3914     As violently as hasty powder fir'd
2 3915     Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
2 3916 
2 3917   Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
2 3918     Is death to any he that utters them.
2 3919 
2 3920   Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
2 3921     And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
2 3922     Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
2 3923     Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
2 3924     The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
2 3925     The world affords no law to make thee rich;
2 3926     Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
2 3927 
2 3928   Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.
2 3929 
2 3930   Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
2 3931 
2 3932   Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
2 3933     And drink it off, and if you had the strength
2 3934     Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
2 3935 
2 3936   Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
2 3937     Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
2 3938     Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
2 3939     I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
2 3940     Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
2 3941     Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
2 3942     To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
2 3943                                                          Exeunt.

2 3947 
2 3948 Scene II.
2 3949 Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.
2 3950 
2 3951 Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.
2 3952 
2 3953 
2 3954   John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
2 3955 
2 3956                       Enter Friar Laurence.
2 3957 
2 3958 
2 3959   Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
2 3960     Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
2 3961     Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
2 3962 
2 3963   John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
2 3964     One of our order, to associate me
2 3965     Here in this city visiting the sick,
2 3966     And finding him, the searchers of the town,
2 3967     Suspecting that we both were in a house
2 3968     Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
2 3969     Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
2 3970     So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
2 3971 
2 3972   Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
2 3973 
2 3974   John. I could not send it- here it is again-
2 3975     Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
2 3976     So fearful were they of infection.
2 3977 
2 3978   Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
2 3979     The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
2 3980     Of dear import; and the neglecting it
2 3981     May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
2 3982     Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
2 3983     Unto my cell.
2 3984 
2 3985   John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
2 3986 
2 3987   Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
2 3988     Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
2 3989     She will beshrew me much that Romeo
2 3990     Hath had no notice of these accidents;
2 3991     But I will write again to Mantua,
2 3992     And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
2 3993     Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.
2 3994 
2 3995

2 3998 Scene III.
2 3999 Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.
2 4000 
2 4001 Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].
2 4002 
2 4003 
2 4004   Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
2 4005     Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
2 4006     Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
2 4007     Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
2 4008     So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
2 4009     (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
2 4010     But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
2 4011     As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
2 4012     Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
2 4013 
2 4014   Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
2 4015     Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]
2 4016 
2 4017   Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
2 4018     (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
2 4019     Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
2 4020     Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
2 4021     The obsequies that I for thee will keep
2 4022     Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
2 4023                                                     Whistle Boy.
2 4024     The boy gives warning something doth approach.
2 4025     What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
2 4026     To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
2 4027     What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]
2 4028 
2 4029        Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
2 4030                     and a crow of iron.
2 4031 
2 4032 
2 4033   Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
2 4034     Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
2 4035     See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
2 4036     Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
2 4037     Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
2 4038     And do not interrupt me in my course.
2 4039     Why I descend into this bed of death
2 4040     Is partly to behold my lady's face,
2 4041     But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
2 4042     A precious ring- a ring that I must use
2 4043     In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
2 4044     But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
2 4045     In what I farther shall intend to do,
2 4046     By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
2 4047     And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
2 4048     The time and my intents are savage-wild,
2 4049     More fierce and more inexorable far
2 4050     Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
2 4051 
2 4052   Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
2 4053 
2 4054   Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
2 4055     Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
2 4056 
2 4057   Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
2 4058     His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]
2 4059 
2 4060   Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
2 4061     Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
2 4062     Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
2 4063     And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
2 4064                                            Romeo opens the tomb.
2 4065 
2 4066   Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
2 4067     That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
2 4068     It is supposed the fair creature died-
2 4069     And here is come to do some villanous shame
2 4070     To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
2 4071     Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
2 4072     Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
2 4073     Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
2 4074     Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
2 4075 
2 4076   Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
2 4077     Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
2 4078     Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
2 4079     Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
2 4080     But not another sin upon my head
2 4081     By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
2 4082     By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
2 4083     For I come hither arm'd against myself.
2 4084     Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
2 4085     A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
2 4086 
2 4087   Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
2 4088     And apprehend thee for a felon here.
2 4089 
2 4090   Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
2 4091                                                      They fight.
2 4092 
2 4093   Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
2 4094                                             [Exit. Paris falls.]
2 4095 
2 4096   Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
2 4097     Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
2 4098 
2 4099   Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
2 4100     Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
2 4101     What said my man when my betossed soul
2 4102     Did not attend him as we rode? I think
2 4103     He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
2 4104     Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
2 4105     Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
2 4106     To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
2 4107     One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
2 4108     I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
2 4109     A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
2 4110     For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
2 4111     This vault a feasting presence full of light.
2 4112     Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
2 4113                                          [Lays him in the tomb.]
2 4114     How oft when men are at the point of death
2 4115     Have they been merry! which their keepers call
2 4116     A lightning before death. O, how may I
2 4117     Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
2 4118     Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
2 4119     Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
2 4120     Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
2 4121     Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
2 4122     And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
2 4123     Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
2 4124     O, what more favour can I do to thee
2 4125     Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
2 4126     To sunder his that was thine enemy?
2 4127     Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
2 4128     Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
2 4129     That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
2 4130     And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
2 4131     Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
2 4132     For fear of that I still will stay with thee
2 4133     And never from this palace of dim night
2 4134     Depart again. Here, here will I remain
2 4135     With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
2 4136     Will I set up my everlasting rest
2 4137     And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
2 4138     From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
2 4139     Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
2 4140     The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
2 4141     A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
2 4142     Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
2 4143     Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
2 4144     The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
2 4145     Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
2 4146     Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
2 4147 
2 4148     Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.
2 4149 
2 4150 
2 4151   Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
2 4152     Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
2 4153 
2 4154   Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
2 4155 
2 4156   Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
2 4157     What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
2 4158     To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
2 4159     It burneth in the Capels' monument.
2 4160 
2 4161   Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
2 4162     One that you love.
2 4163 
2 4164   Friar. Who is it?
2 4165 
2 4166   Bal. Romeo.
2 4167 
2 4168   Friar. How long hath he been there?
2 4169 
2 4170   Bal. Full half an hour.
2 4171 
2 4172   Friar. Go with me to the vault.
2 4173 
2 4174   Bal. I dare not, sir.
2 4175     My master knows not but I am gone hence,
2 4176     And fearfully did menace me with death
2 4177     If I did stay to look on his intents.
2 4178 
2 4179   Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
2 4180     O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
2 4181 
2 4182   Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
2 4183     I dreamt my master and another fought,
2 4184     And that my master slew him.
2 4185 
2 4186   Friar. Romeo!
2 4187     Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
2 4188     The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
2 4189     What mean these masterless and gory swords
2 4190     To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
2 4191     Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
2 4192     And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
2 4193     Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
2 4194                                                    Juliet rises.
2 4195 
2 4196   Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
2 4197     I do remember well where I should be,
2 4198     And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
2 4199 
2 4200   Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
2 4201     Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
2 4202     A greater power than we can contradict
2 4203     Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
2 4204     Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
2 4205     And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
2 4206     Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
2 4207     Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
2 4208     Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
2 4209 
2 4210   Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
2 4211                                                    Exit [Friar].
2 4212     What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
2 4213     Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
2 4214     O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
2 4215     To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
2 4216     Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
2 4217     To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
2 4218     Thy lips are warm!
2 4219 
2 4220   Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
2 4221     Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
2 4222                                       [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
2 4223     This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
2 4224                   She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
2 4225 
2 4226                 Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.
2 4227 
2 4228 
2 4229   Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
2 4230 
2 4231   Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
2 4232     Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
2 4233                                      [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
2 4234     Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
2 4235     And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
2 4236     Who here hath lain this two days buried.
2 4237     Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
2 4238     Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
2 4239                                    [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
2 4240     We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
2 4241     But the true ground of all these piteous woes
2 4242     We cannot without circumstance descry.
2 4243 
2 4244      Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
2 4245 
2 4246   2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
2 4247 
2 4248   Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
2 4249 
2 4250           Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.
2 4251 
2 4252   3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
2 4253     We took this mattock and this spade from him
2 4254     As he was coming from this churchyard side.
2 4255 
2 4256   Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.
2 4257 
2 4258               Enter the Prince [and Attendants].
2 4259 
2 4260 
2 4261   Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
2 4262     That calls our person from our morning rest?
2 4263 
2 4264             Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].
2 4265 
2 4266 
2 4267   Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
2 4268 
2 4269   Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
2 4270     Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
2 4271     With open outcry, toward our monument.
2 4272 
2 4273   Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?
2 4274 
2 4275   Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
2 4276     And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
2 4277     Warm and new kill'd.
2 4278 
2 4279   Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
2 4280 
2 4281   Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
2 4282     With instruments upon them fit to open
2 4283     These dead men's tombs.
2 4284 
2 4285   Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
2 4286     This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
2 4287     Is empty on the back of Montague,
2 4288     And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
2 4289 
2 4290   Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
2 4291     That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
2 4292 
2 4293                Enter Montague [and others].
2 4294 
2 4295 
2 4296   Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
2 4297     To see thy son and heir more early down.
2 4298 
2 4299   Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
2 4300     Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
2 4301     What further woe conspires against mine age?
2 4302 
2 4303   Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.
2 4304 
2 4305   Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
2 4306     To press before thy father to a grave?
2 4307 
2 4308   Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
2 4309     Till we can clear these ambiguities
2 4310     And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
2 4311     And then will I be general of your woes
2 4312     And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
2 4313     And let mischance be slave to patience.
2 4314     Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
2 4315 
2 4316   Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
2 4317     Yet most suspected, as the time and place
2 4318     Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
2 4319     And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
2 4320     Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
2 4321 
2 4322   Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
2 4323 
2 4324   Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
2 4325     Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
2 4326     Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
2 4327     And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
2 4328     I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
2 4329     Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
2 4330     Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
2 4331     For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
2 4332     You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
2 4333     Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
2 4334     To County Paris. Then comes she to me
2 4335     And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
2 4336     To rid her from this second marriage,
2 4337     Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
2 4338     Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
2 4339     A sleeping potion; which so took effect
2 4340     As I intended, for it wrought on her
2 4341     The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
2 4342     That he should hither come as this dire night
2 4343     To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
2 4344     Being the time the potion's force should cease.
2 4345     But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
2 4346     Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
2 4347     Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
2 4348     At the prefixed hour of her waking
2 4349     Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
2 4350     Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
2 4351     Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
2 4352     But when I came, some minute ere the time
2 4353     Of her awaking, here untimely lay
2 4354     The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
2 4355     She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
2 4356     And bear this work of heaven with patience;
2 4357     But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
2 4358     And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
2 4359     But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
2 4360     All this I know, and to the marriage
2 4361     Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
2 4362     Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
2 4363     Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
2 4364     Unto the rigour of severest law.
2 4365 
2 4366   Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
2 4367     Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
2 4368 
2 4369   Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
2 4370     And then in post he came from Mantua
2 4371     To this same place, to this same monument.
2 4372     This letter he early bid me give his father,
2 4373     And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
2 4374     If I departed not and left him there.
2 4375 
2 4376   Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
2 4377     Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
2 4378     Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
2 4379 
2 4380   Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
2 4381     And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
2 4382     Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
2 4383     And by-and-by my master drew on him;
2 4384     And then I ran away to call the watch.
2 4385 
2 4386   Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
2 4387     Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
2 4388     And here he writes that he did buy a poison
2 4389     Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
2 4390     Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
2 4391     Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
2 4392     See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
2 4393     That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
2 4394     And I, for winking at you, discords too,
2 4395     Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
2 4396 
2 4397   Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
2 4398     This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
2 4399     Can I demand.
2 4400 
2 4401   Mon. But I can give thee more;
2 4402     For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
2 4403     That whiles Verona by that name is known,
2 4404     There shall no figure at such rate be set
2 4405     As that of true and faithful Juliet.
2 4406 
2 4407   Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
2 4408     Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
2 4409 
2 4410   Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
2 4411     The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
2 4412     Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
2 4413     Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
2 4414     For never was a story of more woe
2 4415     Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
2 4416                                                    Exeunt omnes.

2 4461 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
2 4462 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
2 4463 
2 4464 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
2 4465 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
2 4466 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
2 4467 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
2 4468 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
2 4469 http://gutenberg.org/license).

2 4471 
2 4472 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4473 electronic works
2 4474 
2 4475 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4476 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
2 4477 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
2 4478 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
2 4479 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
2 4480 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
2 4481 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
2 4482 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
2 4483 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
2 4484 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
2 4485 
2 4486 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
2 4487 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
2 4488 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
2 4489 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
2 4490 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
2 4491 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
2 4492 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
2 4493 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
2 4494 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
2 4495 
2 4496 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
2 4497 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
2 4498 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
2 4499 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
2 4500 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
2 4501 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
2 4502 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
2 4503 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
2 4504 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
2 4505 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
2 4506 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
2 4507 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
2 4508 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
2 4509 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
2 4510 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
2 4511 
2 4512 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
2 4513 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
2 4514 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
2 4515 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
2 4516 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
2 4517 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
2 4518 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
2 4519 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
2 4520 States.
2 4521 
2 4522 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
2 4523 
2 4524 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
2 4525 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
2 4526 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
2 4527 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
2 4528 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
2 4529 copied or distributed:
2 4530 
2 4531 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
2 4532 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
2 4533 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

2 4535 
2 4536 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
2 4537 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
2 4538 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
2 4539 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
2 4540 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
2 4541 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
2 4542 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
2 4543 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
2 4544 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
2 4545 1.E.9.
2 4546

2 4548 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
2 4549 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
2 4550 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

2 4554 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4555 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

2 4558 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
2 4559 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
2 4560 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
2 4561 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
2 4562 Gutenberg-tm License.
2 4563 
2 4564 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
2 4565 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
2 4566 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
2 4567 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
2 4568 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
2 4569 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
2 4570 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
2 4571 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
2 4572 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
2 4573 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4574 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
2 4575 
2 4576 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
2 4577 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
2 4578 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
2 4579 
2 4580 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
2 4581 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
2 4582 that
2 4583 
2 4584 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
2 4585      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
2 4586      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
2 4587      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
2 4588      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
2 4589      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
2 4590      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
2 4591      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
2 4592      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
2 4593      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
2 4594      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
2 4595      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
2 4596 
2 4597 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
2 4598      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
2 4599      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4600      License.  You must require such a user to return or
2 4601      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
2 4602      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
2 4603      Project Gutenberg-tm works.
2 4604 
2 4605 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

2 4607      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
2 4608      of receipt of the work.
2 4609 
2 4610 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
2 4611      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
2 4612 
2 4613 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4614 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
2 4615 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
2 4616 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
2 4617 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

2 4619 
2 4620 1.F.
2 4621 
2 4622 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
2 4623 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
2 4624 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4625 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
2 4626 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
2 4627 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
2 4628 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
2 4629 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
2 4630 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
2 4631 your equipment.
2 4632 
2 4633 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
2 4634 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
2 4635 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
2 4636 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
2 4637 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
2 4638 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
2 4639 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
2 4640 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
2 4641 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
2 4642 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
2 4643 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
2 4644 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
2 4645 DAMAGE.
2 4646 
2 4647 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
2 4648 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
2 4649 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
2 4650 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
2 4651 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
2 4652 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
2 4653 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
2 4654 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
2 4655 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
2 4656 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
2 4657 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
2 4658 opportunities to fix the problem.
2 4659 
2 4660 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
2 4661 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
2 4662 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
2 4663 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
2 4664 
2 4665 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
2 4666 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
2 4667 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
2 4668 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
2 4669 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
2 4670 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
2 4671 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
2 4672 
2 4673 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
2 4674 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
2 4675 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
2 4676 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
2 4677 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
2 4678 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
2 4679 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
2 4680 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4681 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
2 4682 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

2 4685 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4686 
2 4687 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
2 4688 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
2 4689 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
2 4690 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
2 4691 people in all walks of life.
2 4692 
2 4693 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
2 4694 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
2 4695 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
2 4696 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
2 4697 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
2 4698 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

2 4730 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
2 4731 Literary Archive Foundation
2 4732 
2 4733 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
2 4734 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
2 4735 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
2 4736 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
2 4737 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
2 4738 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
2 4739 status with the IRS.
2 4740 
2 4741 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
2 4742 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
2 4743 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
2 4744 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
2 4745 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
2 4746 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
2 4747 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
2 4748 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
2 4749 
2 4750 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
2 4751 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
2 4752 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
2 4753 approach us with offers to donate.
2 4754 
2 4755 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
2 4756 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
2 4757 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
2 4758 
2 4759 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
2 4760 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
2 4761 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

2 4765 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
2 4766 works.
2 4767 
2 4768 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
2 4769 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
2 4770 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
2 4771 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
2 4772 
2 4773 
2 4774 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
2 4775 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
2 4776 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
2 4777 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
