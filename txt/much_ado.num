14 0 Much adoe about Nothing

14 2 Actus primus, Scena prima.
14 3 
14 4 Enter Leonato Gouernour of Messina, Innogen his wife, Hero his
14 5 daughter,
14 6 and Beatrice his Neece, with a messenger.
14 7 
14 8   Leonato. I learne in this Letter, that Don Peter of Arragon,
14 9 comes this night to Messina
14 10 
14 11    Mess. He is very neere by this: he was not
14 12 three Leagues off when I left him
14 13 
14 14    Leon. How many Gentlemen haue you lost in this
14 15 action?
14 16   Mess. But few of any sort, and none of name
14 17 
14 18    Leon. A victorie is twice it selfe, when the atchieuer
14 19 brings home full numbers: I finde heere, that Don Peter
14 20 hath bestowed much honor on a yong Florentine, called
14 21 Claudio
14 22 
14 23    Mess. Much deseru'd on his part, and equally remembred
14 24 by Don Pedro, he hath borne himselfe beyond the
14 25 promise of his age, doing in the figure of a Lambe, the
14 26 feats of a Lion, he hath indeede better bettred expectation,
14 27 then you must expect of me to tell you how
14 28 
14 29    Leo. He hath an Vnckle heere in Messina, wil be very
14 30 much glad of it
14 31 
14 32    Mess. I haue alreadie deliuered him letters, and there
14 33 appeares much ioy in him, euen so much, that ioy could
14 34 not shew it selfe modest enough, without a badg of bitternesse
14 35 
14 36    Leo. Did he breake out into teares?
14 37   Mess. In great measure
14 38 
14 39    Leo. A kinde ouerflow of kindnesse, there are no faces
14 40 truer, then those that are so wash'd, how much better
14 41 is it to weepe at ioy, then to ioy at weeping?
14 42   Bea. I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from
14 43 the warres, or no?
14 44   Mess. I know none of that name, Lady, there was
14 45 none such in the armie of any sort
14 46 
14 47    Leon. What is he that you aske for Neece?
14 48   Hero. My cousin meanes Signior Benedick of Padua
14 49   Mess. O he's return'd, and as pleasant as euer he was
14 50 
14 51    Beat. He set vp his bils here in Messina, & challeng'd
14 52 Cupid at the Flight: and my Vnckles foole reading the
14 53 Challenge, subscrib'd for Cupid, and challeng'd him at
14 54 the Burbolt. I pray you, how many hath hee kil'd and
14 55 eaten in these warres? But how many hath he kil'd? for
14 56 indeed, I promis'd to eate all of his killing
14 57 
14 58    Leon. 'Faith Neece, you taxe Signior Benedicke too
14 59 much, but hee'l be meete with you, I doubt it not
14 60 
14 61    Mess. He hath done good seruice Lady in these wars
14 62 
14 63    Beat. You had musty victuall, and he hath holpe to
14 64 ease it: he's a very valiant Trencher-man, hee hath an
14 65 excellent stomacke
14 66 
14 67    Mess. And a good souldier too Lady
14 68 
14 69    Beat. And a good souldier to a Lady. But what is he
14 70 to a Lord?
14 71   Mess. A Lord to a Lord, a man to a man, stuft with
14 72 all honourable vertues
14 73 
14 74    Beat. It is so indeed, he is no lesse then a stuft man:
14 75 but for the stuffing well, we are all mortall
14 76 
14 77    Leon. You must not (sir) mistake my Neece, there is
14 78 a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick, & her:
14 79 they neuer meet, but there's a skirmish of wit between
14 80 them
14 81 
14 82    Bea. Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict,
14 83 foure of his fiue wits went halting off, and now is
14 84 the whole man gouern'd with one: so that if hee haue
14 85 wit enough to keepe himselfe warme, let him beare it
14 86 for a difference betweene himselfe and his horse: For it
14 87 is all the wealth that he hath left, to be knowne a reasonable
14 88 creature. Who is his companion now? He hath
14 89 euery month a new sworne brother
14 90 
14 91    Mess. Is't possible?
14 92   Beat. Very easily possible: he weares his faith but as
14 93 the fashion of his hat, it euer changes with y next block
14 94 
14 95    Mess. I see (Lady) the Gentleman is not in your
14 96 bookes
14 97 
14 98    Bea. No, and he were, I would burne my study. But
14 99 I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young
14 100 squarer now, that will make a voyage with him to the
14 101 diuell?
14 102   Mess. He is most in the company of the right noble
14 103 Claudio
14 104 
14 105    Beat. O Lord, he will hang vpon him like a disease:
14 106 he is sooner caught then the pestilence, and the taker
14 107 runs presently mad. God helpe the noble Claudio, if hee
14 108 haue caught the Benedict, it will cost him a thousand
14 109 pound ere he be cur'd
14 110 
14 111    Mess. I will hold friends with you Lady
14 112 
14 113    Bea. Do good friend
14 114 
14 115    Leo. You'l ne're run mad Neece
14 116 
14 117    Bea. No, not till a hot Ianuary
14 118 
14 119    Mess. Don Pedro is approach'd.
14 120 
14 121 Enter don Pedro, Claudio, Benedicke, Balthasar, and Iohn the
14 122 bastard.
14 123 
14 124   Pedro. Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet
14 125 your trouble: the fashion of the world is to auoid cost,
14 126 and you encounter it
14 127 
14 128    Leon. Neuer came trouble to my house in the likenes
14 129 of your Grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
14 130 remaine: but when you depart from me, sorrow abides,
14 131 and happinesse takes his leaue
14 132 
14 133    Pedro. You embrace your charge too willingly: I
14 134 thinke this is your daughter
14 135 
14 136    Leonato. Her mother hath many times told me so
14 137 
14 138    Bened. Were you in doubt that you askt her?
14 139   Leonato. Signior Benedicke, no, for then were you a
14 140 childe
14 141 
14 142    Pedro. You haue it full Benedicke, we may ghesse by
14 143 this, what you are, being a man, truely the Lady fathers
14 144 her selfe: be happie Lady, for you are like an honorable
14 145 father
14 146 
14 147    Ben. If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
14 148 haue his head on her shoulders for al Messina, as like him
14 149 as she is
14 150 
14 151    Beat. I wonder that you will still be talking, signior
14 152 Benedicke, no body markes you
14 153 
14 154    Ben. What my deere Ladie Disdaine! are you yet
14 155 liuing?
14 156   Beat. Is it possible Disdaine should die, while shee
14 157 hath such meete foode to feede it, as Signior Benedicke?
14 158 Curtesie it selfe must conuert to Disdaine, if you come in
14 159 her presence
14 160 
14 161    Bene. Then is curtesie a turne-coate, but it is certaine
14 162 I am loued of all Ladies, onely you excepted: and
14 163 I would I could finde in my heart that I had not a hard
14 164 heart, for truely I loue none
14 165 
14 166    Beat. A deere happinesse to women, they would else
14 167 haue beene troubled with a pernitious Suter, I thanke
14 168 God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that, I
14 169 had rather heare my Dog barke at a Crow, than a man
14 170 sweare he loues me
14 171 
14 172    Bene. God keepe your Ladiship still in that minde,
14 173 so some Gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate
14 174 scratcht face
14 175 
14 176    Beat. Scratching could not make it worse, and 'twere
14 177 such a face as yours were
14 178 
14 179    Bene. Well, you are a rare Parrat teacher
14 180 
14 181    Beat. A bird of my tongue, is better than a beast of
14 182 your
14 183 
14 184    Ben. I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,
14 185 and so good a continuer, but keepe your way a Gods
14 186 name, I haue done
14 187 
14 188    Beat. You alwaies end with a Iades tricke, I know
14 189 you of old
14 190 
14 191    Pedro. This is the summe of all: Leonato, signior Claudio,
14 192 and signior Benedicke; my deere friend Leonato, hath
14 193 inuited you all, I tell him we shall stay here, at the least
14 194 a moneth, and he heartily praies some occasion may detaine
14 195 vs longer: I dare sweare hee is no hypocrite, but
14 196 praies from his heart
14 197 
14 198    Leon. If you sweare, my Lord, you shall not be forsworne,
14 199 let mee bid you welcome, my Lord, being reconciled
14 200 to the Prince your brother: I owe you all
14 201 duetie
14 202 
14 203    Iohn. I thanke you, I am not of many words, but I
14 204 thanke you
14 205 
14 206    Leon. Please it your grace leade on?
14 207   Pedro. Your hand Leonato, we will goe together.
14 208 
14 209 Exeunt. Manet Benedicke and Claudio.
14 210 
14 211   Clau. Benedicke, didst thou note the daughter of signior
14 212 Leonato?
14 213   Bene. I noted her not, but I lookt on her
14 214 
14 215    Claud. Is she not a modest yong Ladie?
14 216   Bene. Doe you question me as an honest man should
14 217 doe, for my simple true iudgement? or would you haue
14 218 me speake after my custome, as being a professed tyrant
14 219 to their sexe?
14 220   Clau. No, I pray thee speake in sober iudgement
14 221 
14 222    Bene. Why yfaith me thinks shee's too low for a hie
14 223 praise, too browne for a faire praise, and too little for a
14 224 great praise, onely this commendation I can affoord her,
14 225 that were shee other then she is, she were vnhandsome,
14 226 and being no other, but as she is, I doe not like her
14 227 
14 228    Clau. Thou think'st I am in sport, I pray thee tell me
14 229 truely how thou lik'st her
14 230 
14 231    Bene. Would you buie her, that you enquier after
14 232 her?
14 233   Clau. Can the world buie such a iewell?
14 234   Ben. Yea, and a case to put it into, but speake you this
14 235 with a sad brow? Or doe you play the flowting iacke, to
14 236 tell vs Cupid is a good Hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare
14 237 Carpenter: Come, in what key shall a man take you to
14 238 goe in the song?
14 239   Clau. In mine eie, she is the sweetest Ladie that euer
14 240 I lookt on
14 241 
14 242    Bene. I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no
14 243 such matter: there's her cosin, and she were not possest
14 244 with a furie, exceedes her as much in beautie, as the first
14 245 of Maie doth the last of December: but I hope you haue
14 246 no intent to turne husband, haue you?
14 247   Clau. I would scarce trust my selfe, though I had
14 248 sworne the contrarie, if Hero would be my wife
14 249 
14 250    Bene. Ist come to this? in faith hath not the world one
14 251 man but he will weare his cap with suspition? shall I neuer
14 252 see a batcheller of three score againe? goe to yfaith,
14 253 and thou wilt needes thrust thy necke into a yoke, weare
14 254 the print of it, and sigh away sundaies: looke, don Pedro
14 255 is returned to seeke you.
14 256 
14 257 Enter don Pedro, Iohn the bastard.
14 258 
14 259   Pedr. What secret hath held you here, that you followed
14 260 not to Leonatoes?
14 261   Bened. I would your Grace would constraine mee to
14 262 tell
14 263 
14 264    Pedro. I charge thee on thy allegeance
14 265 
14 266    Ben. You heare, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a
14 267 dumbe man, I would haue you thinke so (but on my allegiance,
14 268 marke you this, on my allegiance) hee is in
14 269 loue, With who? now that is your Graces part: marke
14 270 how short his answere is, with Hero, Leonatoes short
14 271 daughter
14 272 
14 273    Clau. If this were so, so were it vttred
14 274 
14 275    Bened. Like the old tale, my Lord, it is not so, nor 'twas
14 276 not so: but indeede, God forbid it should be so
14 277 
14 278    Clau. If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
14 279 should be otherwise
14 280 
14 281    Pedro. Amen, if you loue her, for the Ladie is verie
14 282 well worthie
14 283 
14 284    Clau. You speake this to fetch me in, my Lord
14 285 
14 286    Pedr. By my troth I speake my thought
14 287 
14 288    Clau. And in faith, my Lord, I spoke mine
14 289 
14 290    Bened. And by my two faiths and troths, my Lord, I
14 291 speake mine
14 292 
14 293    Clau. That I loue her, I feele
14 294 
14 295    Pedr. That she is worthie, I know
14 296 
14 297    Bened. That I neither feele how shee should be loued,
14 298 nor know how shee should be worthie, is the
14 299 opinion that fire cannot melt out of me, I will die in it at
14 300 the stake
14 301 
14 302    Pedr. Thou wast euer an obstinate heretique in the despight
14 303 of Beautie
14 304 
14 305    Clau. And neuer could maintaine his part, but in the
14 306 force of his will
14 307   Ben. That a woman conceiued me, I thanke her: that
14 308 she brought mee vp, I likewise giue her most humble
14 309 thankes: but that I will haue a rechate winded in my
14 310 forehead, or hang my bugle in an inuisible baldricke, all
14 311 women shall pardon me: because I will not do them the
14 312 wrong to mistrust any, I will doe my selfe the right to
14 313 trust none: and the fine is, (for the which I may goe the
14 314 finer) I will liue a Batchellor
14 315 
14 316    Pedro. I shall see thee ere I die, looke pale with loue
14 317 
14 318    Bene. With anger, with sicknesse, or with hunger,
14 319 my Lord, not with loue: proue that euer I loose more
14 320 blood with loue, then I will get againe with drinking,
14 321 picke out mine eyes with a Ballet-makers penne, and
14 322 hang me vp at the doore of a brothel-house for the signe
14 323 of blinde Cupid
14 324 
14 325    Pedro. Well, if euer thou doost fall from this faith,
14 326 thou wilt proue a notable argument
14 327 
14 328    Bene. If I do, hang me in a bottle like a Cat, & shoot
14 329 at me, and he that hit's me, let him be clapt on the shoulder,
14 330 and cal'd Adam
14 331 
14 332    Pedro. Well, as time shall trie: In time the sauage
14 333 Bull doth beare the yoake
14 334 
14 335    Bene. The sauage bull may, but if euer the sensible
14 336 Benedicke beare it, plucke off the bulles hornes, and set
14 337 them in my forehead, and let me be vildely painted, and
14 338 in such great Letters as they write, heere is good horse
14 339 to hire: let them signifie vnder my signe, here you may
14 340 see Benedicke the married man
14 341 
14 342    Clau. If this should euer happen, thou wouldst bee
14 343 horne mad
14 344 
14 345    Pedro. Nay, if Cupid haue not spent all his Quiuer in
14 346 Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly
14 347 
14 348    Bene. I looke for an earthquake too then
14 349 
14 350    Pedro. Well, you will temporize with the houres, in
14 351 the meane time, good Signior Benedicke, repaire to Leonatoes,
14 352 commend me to him, and tell him I will not faile
14 353 him at supper, for indeede he hath made great preparation
14 354 
14 355    Bene. I haue almost matter enough in me for such an
14 356 Embassage, and so I commit you
14 357 
14 358    Clau. To the tuition of God. From my house, if I
14 359 had it
14 360 
14 361    Pedro. The sixt of Iuly. Your louing friend, Benedick
14 362 
14 363    Bene. Nay mocke not, mocke not; the body of your
14 364 discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the
14 365 guardes are but slightly basted on neither, ere you flout
14 366 old ends any further, examine your conscience, and so I
14 367 leaue you.
14 368 
14 369 Enter.
14 370 
14 371   Clau. My Liege, your Highnesse now may doe mee
14 372 good
14 373 
14 374    Pedro. My loue is thine to teach, teach it but how,
14 375 And thou shalt see how apt it is to learne
14 376 Any hard Lesson that may do thee good
14 377 
14 378    Clau. Hath Leonato any sonne my Lord?
14 379   Pedro. No childe but Hero, she's his onely heire.
14 380 Dost thou affect her Claudio?
14 381   Clau. O my Lord,
14 382 When you went onward on this ended action,
14 383 I look'd vpon her with a souldiers eie,
14 384 That lik'd, but had a rougher taske in hand,
14 385 Than to driue liking to the name of loue:
14 386 But now I am return'd, and that warre-thoughts
14 387 Haue left their places vacant: in their roomes,
14 388 Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
14 389 All prompting mee how faire yong Hero is,
14 390 Saying I lik'd her ere I went to warres
14 391 
14 392    Pedro. Thou wilt be like a louer presently,
14 393 And tire the hearer with a booke of words:
14 394 If thou dost loue faire Hero, cherish it,
14 395 And I will breake with her: wast not to this end,
14 396 That thou beganst to twist so fine a story?
14 397   Clau. How sweetly doe you minister to loue,
14 398 That know loues griefe by his complexion!
14 399 But lest my liking might too sodaine seeme,
14 400 I would haue salu'd it with a longer treatise
14 401 
14 402    Ped. What need y bridge much broder then the flood?
14 403 The fairest graunt is the necessitie:
14 404 Looke what will serue, is fit: 'tis once, thou louest,
14 405 And I will fit thee with the remedie,
14 406 I know we shall haue reuelling to night,
14 407 I will assume thy part in some disguise,
14 408 And tell faire Hero I am Claudio,
14 409 And in her bosome Ile vnclaspe my heart,
14 410 And take her hearing prisoner with the force
14 411 And strong incounter of my amorous tale:
14 412 Then after, to her father will I breake,
14 413 And the conclusion is, shee shall be thine,
14 414 In practise let vs put it presently.
14 415 
14 416 Exeunt.
14 417 
14 418 Enter Leonato and an old man, brother to Leonato.
14 419 
14 420   Leo. How now brother, where is my cosen your son:
14 421 hath he prouided this musicke?
14 422   Old. He is very busie about it, but brother, I can tell
14 423 you newes that you yet dreamt not of
14 424 
14 425    Lo. Are they good?
14 426   Old. As the euents stamps them, but they haue a good
14 427 couer: they shew well outward, the Prince and Count
14 428 Claudio walking in a thick pleached alley in my orchard,
14 429 were thus ouer-heard by a man of mine: the Prince discouered
14 430 to Claudio that hee loued my niece your daughter,
14 431 and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance,
14 432 and if hee found her accordant, hee meant to take the
14 433 present time by the top, and instantly breake with you
14 434 of it
14 435 
14 436    Leo. Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
14 437   Old. A good sharpe fellow, I will send for him, and
14 438 question him your selfe
14 439 
14 440    Leo. No, no; wee will hold it as a dreame, till it appeare
14 441 it selfe: but I will acquaint my daughter withall,
14 442 that she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peraduenture
14 443 this bee true: goe you and tell her of it: coosins,
14 444 you know what you haue to doe, O I crie you mercie
14 445 friend, goe you with mee and I will vse your skill,
14 446 good cosin haue a care this busie time.
14 447 
14 448 Exeunt.
14 449 
14 450 Enter Sir Iohn the Bastard, and Conrade his companion.
14 451 
14 452   Con. What the good yeere my Lord, why are you
14 453 thus out of measure sad?
14 454   Ioh. There is no measure in the occasion that breeds,
14 455 therefore the sadnesse is without limit
14 456 
14 457    Con. You should heare reason
14 458 
14 459    Iohn. And when I haue heard it, what blessing bringeth
14 460 it?
14 461   Con. If not a present remedy, yet a patient sufferance
14 462 
14 463    Ioh. I wonder that thou (being as thou saist thou art,
14 464 borne vnder Saturne) goest about to apply a morall medicine,
14 465 to a mortifying mischiefe: I cannot hide what I
14 466 am: I must bee sad when I haue cause, and smile at no
14 467 mans iests, eat when I haue stomacke, and wait for no
14 468 mans leisure: sleepe when I am drowsie, and tend on no
14 469 mans businesse, laugh when I am merry, and claw no man
14 470 in his humor
14 471 
14 472    Con. Yea, but you must not make the ful show of this,
14 473 till you may doe it without controllment, you haue of
14 474 late stood out against your brother, and hee hath tane
14 475 you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you
14 476 should take root, but by the faire weather that you make
14 477 your selfe, it is needful that you frame the season for your
14 478 owne haruest
14 479 
14 480    Iohn. I had rather be a canker in a hedge, then a rose
14 481 in his grace, and it better fits my bloud to be disdain'd of
14 482 all, then to fashion a carriage to rob loue from any: in this
14 483 (though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man)
14 484 it must not be denied but I am a plaine dealing villaine, I
14 485 am trusted with a mussell, and enfranchisde with a clog,
14 486 therefore I haue decreed, not to sing in my cage: if I had
14 487 my mouth, I would bite: if I had my liberty, I would do
14 488 my liking: in the meane time, let me be that I am, and
14 489 seeke not to alter me
14 490 
14 491    Con. Can you make no vse of your discontent?
14 492   Iohn. I will make all vse of it, for I vse it onely.
14 493 Who comes here? what newes Borachio?
14 494 
14 495 Enter Borachio.
14 496 
14 497   Bor. I came yonder from a great supper, the Prince
14 498 your brother is royally entertained by Leonato, and I can
14 499 giue you intelligence of an intended marriage
14 500 
14 501    Iohn. Will it serue for any Modell to build mischiefe
14 502 on? What is hee for a foole that betrothes himselfe to
14 503 vnquietnesse?
14 504   Bor. Mary it is your brothers right hand
14 505 
14 506    Iohn. Who, the most exquisite Claudio?
14 507   Bor. Euen he
14 508 
14 509    Iohn. A proper squier, and who, and who, which way
14 510 lookes he?
14 511   Bor. Mary on Hero, the daughter and Heire of Leonato
14 512 
14 513    Iohn. A very forward March-chicke, how came you
14 514 to this:
14 515   Bor. Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoaking
14 516 a musty roome, comes me the Prince and Claudio,
14 517 hand in hand in sad conference: I whipt behind the Arras,
14 518 and there heard it agreed vpon, that the Prince should
14 519 wooe Hero for himselfe, and hauing obtain'd her, giue
14 520 her to Count Claudio
14 521 
14 522    Iohn. Come, come, let vs thither, this may proue food
14 523 to my displeasure, that young start-vp hath all the glorie
14 524 of my ouerthrow: if I can crosse him any way, I blesse
14 525 my selfe euery way, you are both sure, and will assist
14 526 mee?
14 527   Conr. To the death my Lord
14 528 
14 529    Iohn. Let vs to the great supper, their cheere is the
14 530 greater that I am subdued, would the Cooke were of my
14 531 minde: shall we goe proue whats to be done?
14 532   Bor. Wee'll wait vpon your Lordship.
14 533 
14 534 Exeunt.
14 535 
14 536 
14 537 Actus Secundus.
14 538 
14 539 Enter Leonato, his brother, his wife, Hero his daughter, and
14 540 Beatrice his
14 541 neece, and a kinsman.
14 542 
14 543   Leonato. Was not Count Iohn here at supper?
14 544   Brother. I saw him not
14 545 
14 546    Beatrice. How tartly that Gentleman lookes, I neuer
14 547 can see him, but I am heart-burn'd an howre after
14 548 
14 549    Hero. He is of a very melancholy disposition
14 550 
14 551    Beatrice. Hee were an excellent man that were made
14 552 iust in the mid-way betweene him and Benedicke, the one
14 553 is too like an image and saies nothing, and the other too
14 554 like my Ladies eldest sonne, euermore tatling
14 555 
14 556    Leon. Then halfe signior Benedicks tongue in Count
14 557 Iohns mouth, and halfe Count Iohns melancholy in Signior
14 558 Benedicks face
14 559 
14 560    Beat. With a good legge, and a good foot vnckle, and
14 561 money enough in his purse, such a man would winne any
14 562 woman in the world, if he could get her good will
14 563 
14 564    Leon. By my troth Neece, thou wilt neuer get thee a
14 565 husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
14 566 
14 567    Brother. Infaith shee's too curst
14 568 
14 569    Beat. Too curst is more then curst, I shall lessen Gods
14 570 sending that way: for it is said, God sends a curst Cow
14 571 short hornes, but to a Cow too curst he sends none
14 572 
14 573    Leon. So, by being too curst, God will send you no
14 574 hornes
14 575 
14 576    Beat. Iust, if he send me no husband, for the which
14 577 blessing, I am at him vpon my knees euery morning and
14 578 euening: Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
14 579 beard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen
14 580 
14 581    Leonato. You may light vpon a husband that hath no
14 582 beard
14 583 
14 584    Beatrice. What should I doe with him? dresse him in
14 585 my apparell, and make him my waiting gentlewoman? he
14 586 that hath a beard, is more then a youth: and he that hath
14 587 no beard, is lesse then a man: and hee that is more then a
14 588 youth, is not for mee: and he that is lesse then a man, I am
14 589 not for him: therefore I will euen take sixepence in earnest
14 590 of the Berrord, and leade his Apes into hell
14 591 
14 592    Leon. Well then, goe you into hell
14 593 
14 594    Beat. No, but to the gate, and there will the Deuill
14 595 meete mee like an old Cuckold with hornes on his head,
14 596 and say, get you to heauen Beatrice, get you to heauen,
14 597 heere's no place for you maids, so deliuer I vp my Apes,
14 598 and away to S[aint]. Peter: for the heauens, hee shewes mee
14 599 where the Batchellers sit, and there liue wee as merry as
14 600 the day is long
14 601 
14 602    Brother. Well neece, I trust you will be rul'd by your
14 603 father
14 604 
14 605    Beatrice. Yes faith, it is my cosens dutie to make curtsie,
14 606 and say, as it please you: but yet for all that cosin, let
14 607 him be a handsome fellow, or else make an other cursie,
14 608 and say, father, as it please me
14 609 
14 610    Leonato. Well neece, I hope to see you one day fitted
14 611 with a husband
14 612 
14 613    Beatrice. Not till God make men of some other mettall
14 614 then earth, would it not grieue a woman to be ouermastred
14 615 with a peece of valiant dust: to make account of
14 616 her life to a clod of waiward marle? no vnckle, ile none:
14 617 Adams sonnes are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sinne
14 618 to match in my kinred
14 619 
14 620    Leon. Daughter, remember what I told you, if the
14 621 Prince doe solicit you in that kinde, you know your answere
14 622 
14 623    Beatrice. The fault will be in the musicke cosin, if you
14 624 be not woed in good time: if the Prince bee too important,
14 625 tell him there is measure in euery thing, & so dance
14 626 out the answere, for heare me Hero, wooing, wedding, &
14 627 repenting, is as a Scotch jigge, a measure, and a cinquepace:
14 628 the first suite is hot and hasty like a Scotch jigge
14 629 (and full as fantasticall) the wedding manerly modest,
14 630 (as a measure) full of state & aunchentry, and then comes
14 631 repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace
14 632 faster and faster, till he sinkes into his graue
14 633 
14 634    Leonato. Cosin you apprehend passing shrewdly
14 635 
14 636    Beatrice. I haue a good eye vnckle, I can see a Church
14 637 by daylight
14 638 
14 639    Leon. The reuellers are entring brother, make good
14 640 roome.
14 641 Enter Prince, Pedro, Claudio, and Benedicke, and Balthasar, or
14 642 dumbe Iohn,
14 643 Maskers with a drum.
14 644 
14 645   Pedro. Lady, will you walke about with your friend?
14 646   Hero. So you walke softly, and looke sweetly, and say
14 647 nothing, I am yours for the walke, and especially when I
14 648 walke away
14 649 
14 650    Pedro. With me in your company
14 651 
14 652    Hero. I may say so when I please
14 653 
14 654    Pedro. And when please you to say so?
14 655   Hero. When I like your fauour, for God defend the
14 656 Lute should be like the case
14 657 
14 658    Pedro. My visor is Philemons roofe, within the house
14 659 is Loue
14 660 
14 661    Hero. Why then your visor should be thatcht
14 662 
14 663    Pedro. Speake low if you speake Loue
14 664 
14 665    Bene. Well, I would you did like me
14 666 
14 667    Mar. So would not I for your owne sake, for I haue
14 668 manie ill qualities
14 669 
14 670    Bene. Which is one?
14 671   Mar. I say my prayers alowd
14 672 
14 673    Ben. I loue you the better, the hearers may cry Amen
14 674 
14 675    Mar. God match me with a good dauncer
14 676 
14 677    Balt. Amen
14 678 
14 679    Mar. And God keepe him out of my sight when the
14 680 daunce is done: answer Clarke
14 681 
14 682    Balt. No more words, the Clarke is answered
14 683 
14 684    Vrsula. I know you well enough, you are Signior Anthonio
14 685 
14 686    Anth. At a word, I am not
14 687 
14 688    Vrsula. I know you by the wagling of your head
14 689 
14 690    Anth. To tell you true, I counterfet him
14 691 
14 692    Vrsu. You could neuer doe him so ill well, vnlesse
14 693 you were the very man: here's his dry hand vp & down,
14 694 you are he, you are he
14 695 
14 696    Anth. At a word I am not
14 697 
14 698    Vrsula. Come, come, doe you thinke I doe not know
14 699 you by your excellent wit? can vertue hide it selfe? goe
14 700 to mumme, you are he, graces will appeare, and there's
14 701 an end
14 702 
14 703    Beat. Will you not tell me who told you so?
14 704   Bene. No, you shall pardon me
14 705 
14 706    Beat. Nor will you not tell me who you are?
14 707   Bened. Not now
14 708 
14 709    Beat. That I was disdainfull, and that I had my good
14 710 wit out of the hundred merry tales: well, this was Signior
14 711 Benedicke that said so
14 712 
14 713    Bene. What's he?
14 714   Beat. I am sure you know him well enough
14 715 
14 716    Bene. Not I, beleeue me
14 717 
14 718    Beat. Did he neuer make you laugh?
14 719   Bene. I pray you what is he?
14 720   Beat. Why he is the Princes ieaster, a very dull foole,
14 721 onely his gift is, in deuising impossible slanders, none
14 722 but Libertines delight in him, and the commendation is
14 723 not in his witte, but in his villanie, for hee both pleaseth
14 724 men and angers them, and then they laugh at him, and
14 725 beat him: I am sure he is in the Fleet, I would he had
14 726 boorded me
14 727 
14 728    Bene. When I know the Gentleman, Ile tell him what
14 729 you say
14 730 
14 731    Beat. Do, do, hee'l but breake a comparison or two
14 732 on me, which peraduenture (not markt, or not laugh'd
14 733 at) strikes him into melancholly, and then there's a Partridge
14 734 wing saued, for the foole will eate no supper that
14 735 night. We must follow the Leaders
14 736 
14 737    Ben. In euery good thing
14 738 
14 739    Bea. Nay, if they leade to any ill, I will leaue them
14 740 at the next turning.
14 741 
14 742 Exeunt.
14 743 
14 744 Musicke for the dance.
14 745 
14 746   Iohn. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath
14 747 withdrawne her father to breake with him about it: the
14 748 Ladies follow her, and but one visor remaines
14 749 
14 750    Borachio. And that is Claudio, I know him by his bearing
14 751 
14 752    Iohn. Are not you signior Benedicke?
14 753   Clau. You know me well, I am hee
14 754 
14 755    Iohn. Signior, you are verie neere my Brother in his
14 756 loue, he is enamor'd on Hero, I pray you disswade him
14 757 from her, she is no equall for his birth: you may do the
14 758 part of an honest man in it
14 759 
14 760    Claudio. How know you he loues her?
14 761   Iohn. I heard him sweare his affection
14 762 
14 763    Bor. So did I too, and he swore he would marrie her
14 764 to night
14 765 
14 766    Iohn. Come, let vs to the banquet.
14 767 
14 768 Ex. manet Clau.
14 769 
14 770   Clau. Thus answere I in name of Benedicke,
14 771 But heare these ill newes with the eares of Claudio:
14 772 'Tis certaine so, the Prince woes for himselfe:
14 773 Friendship is constant in all other things,
14 774 Saue in the Office and affaires of loue:
14 775 Therefore all hearts in loue vse their owne tongues.
14 776 Let euerie eye negotiate for it selfe,
14 777 And trust no Agent: for beautie is a witch,
14 778 Against whose charmes, faith melteth into blood:
14 779 This is an accident of hourely proofe,
14 780 Which I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore Hero.
14 781 Enter Benedicke.
14 782 
14 783   Ben. Count Claudio
14 784 
14 785    Clau. Yea, the same
14 786 
14 787    Ben. Come, will you goe with me?
14 788   Clau. Whither?
14 789   Ben. Euen to the next Willow, about your own businesse,
14 790 Count. What fashion will you weare the Garland
14 791 off? About your necke, like an Vsurers chaine? Or
14 792 vnder your arme, like a Lieutenants scarfe? You must
14 793 weare it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero
14 794 
14 795    Clau . I wish him ioy of her
14 796 
14 797    Ben. Why that's spoken like an honest Drouier, so
14 798 they sel Bullockes: but did you thinke the Prince wold
14 799 haue serued you thus?
14 800   Clau. I pray you leaue me
14 801 
14 802    Ben. Ho now you strike like the blindman, 'twas the
14 803 boy that stole your meate, and you'l beat the post
14 804 
14 805    Clau. If it will not be, Ile leaue you.
14 806 Enter.
14 807 
14 808   Ben. Alas poore hurt fowle, now will he creepe into
14 809 sedges: But that my Ladie Beatrice should know me, &
14 810 not know me: the Princes foole! Hah? It may be I goe
14 811 vnder that title, because I am merrie: yea but so I am
14 812 apt to do my selfe wrong: I am not so reputed, it is the
14 813 base (though bitter) disposition of Beatrice, that putt's
14 814 the world into her person, and so giues me out: well, Ile
14 815 be reuenged as I may.
14 816 Enter the Prince.
14 817 
14 818   Pedro. Now Signior, where's the Count, did you
14 819 see him?
14 820   Bene. Troth my Lord, I haue played the part of Lady
14 821 Fame, I found him heere as melancholy as a Lodge in a
14 822 Warren, I told him, and I thinke, told him true, that your
14 823 grace had got the will of this young Lady, and I offered
14 824 him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a
14 825 garland, as being forsaken, or to binde him a rod, as being
14 826 worthy to be whipt
14 827 
14 828    Pedro. To be whipt, what's his fault?
14 829   Bene. The flat transgression of a Schoole-boy, who
14 830 being ouer-ioyed with finding a birds nest, shewes it his
14 831 companion, and he steales it
14 832 
14 833    Pedro. Wilt thou make a trust, a transgression? the
14 834 transgression is in the stealer
14 835 
14 836    Ben. Yet it had not been amisse the rod had beene
14 837 made, and the garland too, for the garland he might haue
14 838 worne himselfe, and the rod hee might haue bestowed on
14 839 you, who (as I take it) haue stolne his birds nest
14 840 
14 841    Pedro. I will but teach them to sing, and restore them
14 842 to the owner
14 843 
14 844    Bene. If their singing answer your saying, by my faith
14 845 you say honestly
14 846 
14 847    Pedro. The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrell to you, the
14 848 Gentleman that daunst with her, told her shee is much
14 849 wrong'd by you
14 850 
14 851    Bene. O she misusde me past the indurance of a block:
14 852 an oake but with one greene leafe on it, would haue answered
14 853 her: my very visor began to assume life, and scold
14 854 with her: shee told mee, not thinking I had beene my
14 855 selfe, that I was the Princes Iester, and that I was duller
14 856 then a great thaw, hudling iest vpon iest, with such impossible
14 857 conueiance vpon me, that I stood like a man at a
14 858 marke, with a whole army shooting at me: shee speakes
14 859 poynyards, and euery word stabbes: if her breath were
14 860 as terrible as terminations, there were no liuing neere
14 861 her, she would infect to the north starre: I would not
14 862 marry her, though she were indowed with all that Adam
14 863 had left him before he transgrest, she would haue made
14 864   Hercules haue turnd spit, yea, and haue cleft his club to
14 865 make the fire too: come, talke not of her, you shall finde
14 866 her the infernall Ate in good apparell. I would to God
14 867 some scholler would coniure her, for certainely while she
14 868 is heere, a man may liue as quiet in hell, as in a sanctuary,
14 869 and people sinne vpon purpose, because they would goe
14 870 thither, so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation
14 871 followes her.
14 872 Enter Claudio and Beatrice, Leonato, Hero.
14 873 
14 874   Pedro. Looke heere she comes
14 875 
14 876    Bene. Will your Grace command mee any seruice to
14 877 the worlds end? I will goe on the slightest arrand now
14 878 to the Antypodes that you can deuise to send me on: I
14 879 will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the furthest inch
14 880 of Asia: bring you the length of Prester Iohns foot: fetch
14 881 you a hayre off the great Chams beard: doe you any embassage
14 882 to the Pigmies, rather then hould three words
14 883 conference, with this Harpy: you haue no employment
14 884 for me?
14 885   Pedro. None, but to desire your good company
14 886 
14 887    Bene. O God sir, heeres a dish I loue not, I cannot indure
14 888 this Lady tongue.
14 889 Enter.
14 890 
14 891   Pedr. Come Lady, come, you haue lost the heart of
14 892 Signior Benedicke
14 893 
14 894    Beatr. Indeed my Lord, hee lent it me a while, and I
14 895 gaue him vse for it, a double heart for a single one, marry
14 896 once before he wonne it of mee, with false dice, therefore
14 897 your Grace may well say I haue lost it
14 898 
14 899    Pedro. You haue put him downe Lady, you haue put
14 900 him downe
14 901 
14 902    Beat. So I would not he should do me, my Lord, lest
14 903 I should prooue the mother of fooles: I haue brought
14 904 Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seeke
14 905 
14 906    Pedro. Why how now Count, wherfore are you sad?
14 907   Claud. Not sad my Lord
14 908 
14 909    Pedro. How then? sicke?
14 910   Claud. Neither, my Lord
14 911 
14 912    Beat. The Count is neither sad, nor sicke, nor merry,
14 913 nor well: but ciuill Count, ciuill as an Orange, and something
14 914 of a iealous complexion
14 915 
14 916    Pedro. Ifaith Lady, I thinke your blazon to be true.
14 917 though Ile be sworne, if hee be so, his conceit is false:
14 918 heere Claudio, I haue wooed in thy name, and faire Hero
14 919 is won, I haue broke with her father, and his good will
14 920 obtained, name the day of marriage, and God giue
14 921 thee ioy
14 922 
14 923    Leona. Count, take of me my daughter, and with her
14 924 my fortunes: his grace hath made the match, & all grace
14 925 say, Amen to it
14 926 
14 927    Beatr. Speake Count, tis your Qu
14 928 
14 929    Claud. Silence is the perfectest Herault of ioy, I were
14 930 but little happy if I could say, how much? Lady, as you
14 931 are mine, I am yours, I giue away my selfe for you, and
14 932 doat vpon the exchange
14 933 
14 934    Beat. Speake cosin, or (if you cannot) stop his mouth
14 935 with a kisse, and let not him speake neither
14 936 
14 937    Pedro. In faith Lady you haue a merry heart
14 938 
14 939    Beatr. Yea my Lord I thanke it, poore foole it keepes
14 940 on the windy side of Care, my coosin tells him in his eare
14 941 that he is in my heart
14 942 
14 943    Clau. And so she doth coosin
14 944 
14 945    Beat. Good Lord for alliance: thus goes euery one
14 946 to the world but I, and I am sun-burn'd, I may sit in a corner
14 947 and cry, heigh ho for a husband
14 948 
14 949    Pedro. Lady Beatrice, I will get you one
14 950 
14 951    Beat. I would rather haue one of your fathers getting:
14 952 hath your Grace ne're a brother like you? your father
14 953 got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them
14 954 
14 955    Prince. Will you haue me? Lady
14 956 
14 957    Beat. No, my Lord, vnlesse I might haue another for
14 958 working-daies, your Grace is too costly to weare euerie
14 959 day: but I beseech your Grace pardon mee, I was borne
14 960 to speake all mirth, and no matter
14 961 
14 962    Prince. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry,
14 963 best becomes you, for out of question, you were born
14 964 in a merry howre
14 965 
14 966    Beatr. No sure my Lord, my Mother cried, but then
14 967 there was a starre daunst, and vnder that was I borne: cosins
14 968 God giue you ioy
14 969 
14 970    Leonato. Neece, will you looke to those things I told
14 971 you of?
14 972   Beat. I cry you mercy Vncle, by your Graces pardon.
14 973 
14 974 Exit Beatrice.
14 975 
14 976   Prince. By my troth a pleasant spirited Lady
14 977 
14 978    Leon. There's little of the melancholy element in her
14 979 my Lord, she is neuer sad, but when she sleepes, and not
14 980 euer sad then: for I haue heard my daughter say, she hath
14 981 often dreamt of vnhappinesse, and wakt her selfe with
14 982 laughing
14 983 
14 984    Pedro. Shee cannot indure to heare tell of a husband
14 985 
14 986    Leonato. O, by no meanes, she mocks all her wooers
14 987 out of suite
14 988 
14 989    Prince. She were an excellent wife for Benedick
14 990 
14 991    Leonato. O Lord, my Lord, if they were but a weeke
14 992 married, they would talke themselues madde
14 993 
14 994    Prince. Counte Claudio, when meane you to goe to
14 995 Church?
14 996   Clau. To morrow my Lord, Time goes on crutches,
14 997 till Loue haue all his rites
14 998 
14 999    Leonato. Not till monday, my deare sonne, which is
14 1000 hence a iust seuen night, and a time too briefe too, to haue
14 1001 all things answer minde
14 1002 
14 1003    Prince. Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing,
14 1004 but I warrant thee Claudio, the time shall not goe
14 1005 dully by vs, I will in the interim, vndertake one of Hercules
14 1006 labors, which is, to bring Signior Benedicke and the
14 1007 Lady Beatrice into a mountaine of affection, th' one with
14 1008 th' other, I would faine haue it a match, and I doubt not
14 1009 but to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance
14 1010 as I shall giue you direction
14 1011 
14 1012    Leonato. My Lord, I am for you, though it cost mee
14 1013 ten nights watchings
14 1014 
14 1015    Claud. And I my Lord
14 1016 
14 1017    Prin. And you to gentle Hero?
14 1018   Hero. I will doe any modest office, my Lord, to helpe
14 1019 my cosin to a good husband
14 1020 
14 1021    Prin. And Benedick is not the vnhopefullest husband
14 1022 that I know: thus farre can I praise him, hee is of a noble
14 1023 straine, of approued valour, and confirm'd honesty, I will
14 1024 teach you how to humour your cosin, that shee shall fall
14 1025 in loue with Benedicke, and I, with your two helpes, will
14 1026 so practise on Benedicke, that in despight of his quicke
14 1027 wit, and his queasie stomacke, hee shall fall in loue with
14 1028 Beatrice: if wee can doe this, Cupid is no longer an Archer,
14 1029 his glory shall be ours, for wee are the onely louegods,
14 1030 goe in with me, and I will tell you my drift.
14 1031 Enter.
14 1032 
14 1033 Enter Iohn and Borachio.
14 1034 
14 1035   Ioh. It is so, the Count Claudio shal marry the daughter
14 1036 of Leonato
14 1037 
14 1038    Bora. Yea my Lord, but I can crosse it
14 1039 
14 1040    Iohn. Any barre, any crosse, any impediment, will be
14 1041 medicinable to me, I am sicke in displeasure to him, and
14 1042 whatsoeuer comes athwart his affection, ranges euenly
14 1043 with mine, how canst thou crosse this marriage?
14 1044   Bor. Not honestly my Lord, but so couertly, that no
14 1045 dishonesty shall appeare in me
14 1046 
14 1047    Iohn. Shew me breefely how
14 1048 
14 1049    Bor. I thinke I told your Lordship a yeere since, how
14 1050 much I am in the fauour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman
14 1051 to Hero
14 1052 
14 1053    Iohn. I remember
14 1054 
14 1055    Bor. I can at any vnseasonable instant of the night,
14 1056 appoint her to looke out at her Ladies chamber window
14 1057 
14 1058    Iohn. What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
14 1059   Bor. The poyson of that lies in you to temper, goe
14 1060 you to the Prince your brother, spare not to tell him, that
14 1061 hee hath wronged his Honor in marrying the renowned
14 1062 Claudio, whose estimation do you mightily hold vp, to a
14 1063 contaminated stale, such a one as Hero
14 1064 
14 1065    Iohn. What proofe shall I make of that?
14 1066   Bor. Proofe enough, to misuse the Prince, to vexe
14 1067 Claudio, to vndoe Hero, and kill Leonato, looke you for any
14 1068 other issue?
14 1069   Iohn. Onely to despight them, I will endeauour any
14 1070 thing
14 1071 
14 1072    Bor. Goe then, finde me a meete howre, to draw on
14 1073 Pedro and the Count Claudio alone, tell them that you
14 1074 know that Hero loues me, intend a kinde of zeale both
14 1075 to the Prince and Claudio (as in a loue of your brothers
14 1076 honor who hath made this match) and his friends reputation,
14 1077 who is thus like to be cosen'd with the semblance
14 1078 of a maid, that you haue discouer'd thus: they will scarcely
14 1079 beleeue this without triall: offer them instances which
14 1080 shall beare no lesse likelihood, than to see mee at her
14 1081 chamber window, heare me call Margaret, Hero; heare
14 1082 Margaret terme me Claudio, and bring them to see this
14 1083 the very night before the intended wedding, for in the
14 1084 meane time, I will so fashion the matter, that Hero shall
14 1085 be absent, and there shall appeare such seeming truths of
14 1086 Heroes disloyaltie, that iealousie shall be cal'd assurance,
14 1087 and all the preparation ouerthrowne
14 1088 
14 1089    Iohn. Grow this to what aduerse issue it can, I will
14 1090 put it in practise: be cunning in the working this, and
14 1091 thy fee is a thousand ducates
14 1092 
14 1093    Bor. Be thou constant in the accusation, and my cunning
14 1094 shall not shame me
14 1095 
14 1096    Iohn. I will presentlie goe learne their day of marriage.
14 1097 Enter.
14 1098 
14 1099 Enter Benedicke alone.
14 1100 
14 1101   Bene. Boy
14 1102 
14 1103    Boy. Signior
14 1104 
14 1105    Bene. In my chamber window lies a booke, bring it
14 1106 hither to me in the orchard
14 1107 
14 1108    Boy. I am heere already sir.
14 1109 Enter.
14 1110 
14 1111   Bene. I know that, but I would haue thee hence, and
14 1112 heere againe. I doe much wonder, that one man seeing
14 1113 how much another man is a foole, when he dedicates his
14 1114 behauiours to loue, will after hee hath laught at such
14 1115 shallow follies in others, become the argument of his
14 1116 owne scorne, by falling in loue, & such a man is Claudio.
14 1117 I haue known when there was no musicke with him but
14 1118 the drum and the fife, and now had hee rather heare the
14 1119 taber and the pipe: I haue knowne when he would haue
14 1120 walkt ten mile afoot, to see a good armor, and now will
14 1121 he lie ten nights awake caruing the fashion of a new dublet:
14 1122 he was wont to speake plaine, & to the purpose (like
14 1123 an honest man & a souldier) and now is he turn'd orthography,
14 1124 his words are a very fantasticall banquet, iust so
14 1125 many strange dishes: may I be so conuerted, & see with
14 1126 these eyes? I cannot tell, I thinke not: I will not bee
14 1127 sworne, but loue may transforme me to an oyster, but Ile
14 1128 take my oath on it, till he haue made an oyster of me, he
14 1129 shall neuer make me such a foole: one woman is faire, yet
14 1130 I am well: another is wise, yet I am well: another vertuous,
14 1131 yet I am well: but till all graces be in one woman,
14 1132 one woman shall not come in my grace: rich shee shall
14 1133 be, that's certaine: wise, or Ile none: vertuous, or Ile neuer
14 1134 cheapen her: faire, or Ile neuer looke on her: milde,
14 1135 or come not neere me: Noble, or not for an Angell: of
14 1136 good discourse: an excellent Musitian, and her haire shal
14 1137 be of what colour it please God, hah! the Prince and
14 1138 Monsieur Loue, I will hide me in the Arbor.
14 1139 Enter Prince, Leonato, Claudio, and Iacke Wilson.
14 1140 
14 1141   Prin. Come, shall we heare this musicke?
14 1142   Claud. Yea my good Lord: how still the euening is.
14 1143 As husht on purpose to grace harmonie
14 1144 
14 1145    Prin. See you where Benedicke hath hid himselfe?
14 1146   Clau. O very well my Lord: the musicke ended,
14 1147 Wee'll fit the kid-foxe with a penny worth
14 1148 
14 1149    Prince. Come Balthasar, wee'll heare that song again
14 1150 
14 1151    Balth. O good my Lord, taxe not so bad a voyce,
14 1152 To slander musicke any more then once
14 1153 
14 1154    Prin. It is the witnesse still of excellency,
14 1155 To slander Musicke any more then once
14 1156 
14 1157    Prince. It is the witnesse still of excellencie,
14 1158 To put a strange face on his owne perfection,
14 1159 I pray thee sing, and let me woe no more
14 1160 
14 1161    Balth. Because you talke of wooing, I will sing,
14 1162 Since many a wooer doth commence his suit,
14 1163 To her he thinkes not worthy, yet he wooes,
14 1164 Yet will he sweare he loues
14 1165 
14 1166    Prince. Nay pray thee come,
14 1167 Or if thou wilt hold longer argument,
14 1168 Doe it in notes
14 1169 
14 1170    Balth. Note this before my notes,
14 1171 Theres not a note of mine that's worth the noting
14 1172 
14 1173    Prince. Why these are very crotchets that he speaks,
14 1174 Note notes forsooth, and nothing
14 1175 
14 1176    Bene. Now diuine aire, now is his soule rauisht, is it
14 1177 not strange that sheepes guts should hale soules out of
14 1178 mens bodies? well, a horne for my money when all's
14 1179 done.
14 1180 
14 1181 The Song.
14 1182 
14 1183 Sigh no more Ladies, sigh no more,
14 1184 Men were deceiuers euer,
14 1185 One foote in Sea, and one on shore,
14 1186 To one thing constant neuer,
14 1187 Then sigh not so, but let them goe,
14 1188 And be you blithe and bonnie,
14 1189 Conuerting all your sounds of woe,
14 1190 Into hey nony nony.
14 1191 Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
14 1192 Of dumps so dull and heauy,
14 1193 The fraud of men were euer so,
14 1194 Since summer first was leauy,
14 1195 Then sigh not so, &c
14 1196 
14 1197    Prince. By my troth a good song
14 1198 
14 1199    Balth. And an ill singer, my Lord
14 1200 
14 1201    Prince. Ha, no, no faith, thou singst well enough for a
14 1202 shift
14 1203 
14 1204    Ben. And he had been a dog that should haue howld
14 1205 thus, they would haue hang'd him, and I pray God his
14 1206 bad voyce bode no mischiefe, I had as liefe haue heard
14 1207 the night-rauen, come what plague could haue come after
14 1208 it
14 1209 
14 1210    Prince. Yea marry, dost thou heare Balthasar? I pray
14 1211 thee get vs some excellent musick: for to morrow night
14 1212 we would haue it at the Lady Heroes chamber window
14 1213 
14 1214    Balth. The best I can, my Lord.
14 1215 
14 1216 Exit Balthasar.
14 1217 
14 1218   Prince. Do so, farewell. Come hither Leonato, what
14 1219 was it you told me of to day, that your Niece Beatrice
14 1220 was in loue with signior Benedicke?
14 1221   Cla. O I, stalke on, stalke on, the foule sits. I did neuer
14 1222 thinke that Lady would haue loued any man
14 1223 
14 1224    Leon. No, nor I neither, but most wonderful, that she
14 1225 should so dote on Signior Benedicke, whom shee hath in
14 1226 all outward behauiours seemed euer to abhorre
14 1227 
14 1228    Bene. Is't possible? sits the winde in that corner?
14 1229   Leo. By my troth my Lord, I cannot tell what to
14 1230 thinke of it, but that she loues him with an inraged affection,
14 1231 it is past the infinite of thought
14 1232 
14 1233    Prince. May be she doth but counterfeit
14 1234 
14 1235    Claud. Faith like enough
14 1236 
14 1237    Leon. O God! counterfeit? there was neuer counterfeit
14 1238 of passion, came so neere the life of passion as she discouers
14 1239 it
14 1240 
14 1241    Prince. Why what effects of passion shewes she?
14 1242   Claud. Baite the hooke well, this fish will bite
14 1243 
14 1244    Leon. What effects my Lord? shee will sit you, you
14 1245 heard my daughter tell you how
14 1246 
14 1247    Clau. She did indeed
14 1248 
14 1249    Prince. How, how I pray you? you amaze me, I would
14 1250 haue thought her spirit had beene inuincible against all
14 1251 assaults of affection
14 1252 
14 1253    Leo. I would haue sworne it had, my Lord, especially
14 1254 against Benedicke
14 1255 
14 1256    Bene. I should thinke this a gull, but that the whitebearded
14 1257 fellow speakes it: knauery cannot sure hide
14 1258 himselfe in such reuerence
14 1259 
14 1260    Claud. He hath tane th' infection, hold it vp
14 1261 
14 1262    Prince. Hath shee made her affection known to Benedicke:
14 1263   Leonato. No, and sweares she neuer will, that's her
14 1264 torment
14 1265 
14 1266    Claud. 'Tis true indeed, so your daughter saies: shall
14 1267 I, saies she, that haue so oft encountred him with scorne,
14 1268 write to him that I loue him?
14 1269   Leo. This saies shee now when shee is beginning to
14 1270 write to him, for shee'll be vp twenty times a night, and
14 1271 there will she sit in her smocke, till she haue writ a sheet
14 1272 of paper: my daughter tells vs all
14 1273 
14 1274    Clau. Now you talke of a sheet of paper, I remember
14 1275 a pretty iest your daughter told vs of
14 1276 
14 1277    Leon. O when she had writ it, & was reading it ouer,
14 1278 she found Benedicke and Beatrice betweene the sheete
14 1279 
14 1280    Clau. That
14 1281 
14 1282    Leon. O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,
14 1283 raild at her self, that she should be so immodest to write,
14 1284 to one that shee knew would flout her: I measure him,
14 1285 saies she, by my owne spirit, for I should flout him if hee
14 1286 writ to mee, yea though I loue him, I should
14 1287 
14 1288    Clau. Then downe vpon her knees she falls, weepes,
14 1289 sobs, beates her heart, teares her hayre, praies, curses, O
14 1290 sweet Benedicke, God giue me patience
14 1291 
14 1292    Leon. She doth indeed, my daughter saies so, and the
14 1293 extasie hath so much ouerborne her, that my daughter is
14 1294 somtime afeard she will doe a desperate out-rage to her
14 1295 selfe, it is very true
14 1296 
14 1297    Prince. It were good that Benedicke knew of it by some
14 1298 other, if she will not discouer it
14 1299 
14 1300    Clau. To what end? he would but make a sport of it,
14 1301 and torment the poore Lady worse
14 1302 
14 1303    Prin. And he should, it were an almes to hang him,
14 1304 shee's an excellent sweet Lady, and (out of all suspition,)
14 1305 she is vertuous
14 1306 
14 1307    Claudio. And she is exceeding wise
14 1308 
14 1309    Prince. In euery thing, but in louing Benedicke
14 1310 
14 1311    Leon. O my Lord, wisedome and bloud combating in
14 1312 so tender a body, we haue ten proofes to one, that bloud
14 1313 hath the victory, I am sorry for her, as I haue iust cause,
14 1314 being her Vncle, and her Guardian
14 1315 
14 1316    Prince. I would shee had bestowed this dotage on
14 1317 mee, I would haue daft all other respects, and made her
14 1318 halfe my selfe: I pray you tell Benedicke of it, and heare
14 1319 what he will say
14 1320 
14 1321    Leon. Were it good thinke you?
14 1322   Clau. Hero thinkes surely she wil die, for she saies she
14 1323 will die, if hee loue her not, and shee will die ere shee
14 1324 make her loue knowne, and she will die if hee wooe her,
14 1325 rather than shee will bate one breath of her accustomed
14 1326 crossenesse
14 1327 
14 1328    Prince. She doth well, if she should make tender of her
14 1329 loue, 'tis very possible hee'l scorne it, for the man (as you
14 1330 know all) hath a contemptible spirit
14 1331 
14 1332    Clau. He is a very proper man
14 1333 
14 1334    Prin. He hath indeed a good outward happines
14 1335 
14 1336    Clau. 'Fore God, and in my minde very wise
14 1337 
14 1338    Prin. He doth indeed shew some sparkes that are like
14 1339 wit
14 1340 
14 1341    Leon. And I take him to be valiant
14 1342 
14 1343    Prin. As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing of
14 1344 quarrels you may see hee is wise, for either hee auoydes
14 1345 them with great discretion, or vndertakes them with a
14 1346 Christian-like feare
14 1347 
14 1348    Leon. If hee doe feare God, a must necessarilie keepe
14 1349 peace, if hee breake the peace, hee ought to enter into a
14 1350 quarrell with feare and trembling
14 1351 
14 1352    Prin. And so will he doe, for the man doth fear God,
14 1353 howsoeuer it seemes not in him, by some large ieasts hee
14 1354 will make: well, I am sorry for your niece, shall we goe
14 1355 see Benedicke, and tell him of her loue
14 1356 
14 1357    Claud. Neuer tell him, my Lord, let her weare it out
14 1358 with good counsell
14 1359 
14 1360    Leon. Nay that's impossible, she may weare her heart
14 1361 out first
14 1362 
14 1363    Prin. Well, we will heare further of it by your daughter,
14 1364 let it coole the while, I loue Benedicke well, and I
14 1365 could wish he would modestly examine himselfe, to see
14 1366 how much he is vnworthy to haue so good a Lady
14 1367 
14 1368    Leon. My Lord, will you walke? dinner is ready
14 1369 
14 1370    Clau. If he do not doat on her vpon this, I wil neuer
14 1371 trust my expectation
14 1372 
14 1373    Prin. Let there be the same Net spread for her, and
14 1374 that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry:
14 1375 the sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of anothers
14 1376 dotage, and no such matter, that's the Scene that I
14 1377 would see, which will be meerely a dumbe shew: let vs
14 1378 send her to call him into dinner.
14 1379 
14 1380 Exeunt.
14 1381 
14 1382   Bene. This can be no tricke, the conference was sadly
14 1383 borne, they haue the truth of this from Hero, they seeme
14 1384 to pittie the Lady: it seemes her affections haue the full
14 1385 bent: loue me? why it must be requited: I heare how I
14 1386 am censur'd, they say I will beare my selfe proudly, if I
14 1387 perceiue the loue come from her: they say too, that she
14 1388 will rather die than giue any signe of affection: I did neuer
14 1389 thinke to marry, I must not seeme proud, happy are
14 1390 they that heare their detractions, and can put them to
14 1391 mending: they say the Lady is faire, 'tis a truth, I can
14 1392 beare them witnesse: and vertuous, tis so, I cannot reprooue
14 1393 it, and wise, but for louing me, by my troth it is
14 1394 no addition to her witte, nor no great argument of her
14 1395 folly; for I wil be horribly in loue with her, I may chance
14 1396 haue some odde quirkes and remnants of witte broken
14 1397 on mee, because I haue rail'd so long against marriage:
14 1398 but doth not the appetite alter? a man loues the meat in
14 1399 his youth, that he cannot indure in his age. Shall quips
14 1400 and sentences, and these paper bullets of the braine awe
14 1401 a man from the careere of his humour? No, the world
14 1402 must be peopled. When I said I would die a batcheler, I
14 1403 did not think I should liue till I were maried, here comes
14 1404 Beatrice: by this day, shee's a faire Lady, I doe spie some
14 1405 markes of loue in her.
14 1406 Enter Beatrice.
14 1407 
14 1408   Beat. Against my wil I am sent to bid you come in to
14 1409 dinner
14 1410 
14 1411    Bene. Faire Beatrice, I thanke you for your paines
14 1412 
14 1413    Beat. I tooke no more paines for those thankes, then
14 1414 you take paines to thanke me, if it had been painefull, I
14 1415 would not haue come
14 1416 
14 1417    Bene. You take pleasure then in the message
14 1418 
14 1419    Beat. Yea iust so much as you may take vpon a kniues
14 1420 point, and choake a daw withall: you haue no stomacke
14 1421 signior, fare you well.
14 1422 Enter.
14 1423 
14 1424   Bene. Ha, against my will I am sent to bid you come
14 1425 into dinner: there's a double meaning in that: I tooke
14 1426 no more paines for those thankes then you took paines
14 1427 to thanke me, that's as much as to say, any paines that I
14 1428 take for you is as easie as thankes: if I do not take pitty
14 1429 of her I am a villaine, if I doe not loue her I am a Iew, I
14 1430 will goe get her picture.
14 1431 Enter.
14 1432 
14 1433 
14 1434 Actus Tertius.
14 1435 
14 1436 Enter Hero and two Gentlemen, Margaret, and Vrsula.
14 1437 
14 1438   Hero. Good Margaret runne thee to the parlour,
14 1439 There shalt thou finde my Cosin Beatrice,
14 1440 Proposing with the Prince and Claudio,
14 1441 Whisper her eare, and tell her I and Vrsula,
14 1442 Walke in the Orchard, and our whole discourse
14 1443 Is all of her, say that thou ouer-heardst vs,
14 1444 And bid her steale into the pleached bower,
14 1445 Where hony-suckles ripened by the sunne,
14 1446 Forbid the sunne to enter: like fauourites,
14 1447 Made proud by Princes, that aduance their pride,
14 1448 Against that power that bred it, there will she hide her,
14 1449 To listen our purpose, this is thy office,
14 1450 Beare thee well in it, and leaue vs alone
14 1451 
14 1452    Marg. Ile make her come I warrant you presently
14 1453 
14 1454    Hero. Now Vrsula, when Beatrice doth come,
14 1455 As we do trace this alley vp and downe,
14 1456 Our talke must onely be of Benedicke,
14 1457 When I doe name him, let it be thy part,
14 1458 To praise him more then euer man did merit,
14 1459 My talke to thee must be how Benedicke
14 1460 Is sicke in loue with Beatrice; of this matter,
14 1461 Is little Cupids crafty arrow made,
14 1462 That onely wounds by heare-say: now begin,
14 1463 Enter Beatrice.
14 1464 
14 1465 For looke where Beatrice like a Lapwing runs
14 1466 Close by the ground, to heare our conference
14 1467 
14 1468    Vrs. The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
14 1469 Cut with her golden ores the siluer streame,
14 1470 And greedily deuoure the treacherous baite:
14 1471 So angle we for Beatrice, who euen now,
14 1472 Is couched in the wood-bine couerture,
14 1473 Feare you not my part of the Dialogue
14 1474 
14 1475    Her. Then go we neare her that her eare loose nothing,
14 1476 Of the false sweete baite that we lay for it:
14 1477 No truely Vrsula, she is too disdainfull,
14 1478 I know her spirits are as coy and wilde,
14 1479 As Haggerds of the rocke
14 1480 
14 1481    Vrsula. But are you sure,
14 1482 That Benedicke loues Beatrice so intirely?
14 1483   Her. So saies the Prince, and my new trothed Lord
14 1484 
14 1485    Vrs. And did they bid you tell her of it, Madam?
14 1486   Her. They did intreate me to acquaint her of it,
14 1487 But I perswaded them, if they lou'd Benedicke,
14 1488 To wish him wrastle with affection,
14 1489 And neuer to let Beatrice know of it
14 1490 
14 1491    Vrsula. Why did you so, doth not the Gentleman
14 1492 Deserue as full as fortunate a bed,
14 1493 As euer Beatrice shall couch vpon?
14 1494   Hero. O God of loue! I know he doth deserue,
14 1495 As much as may be yeelded to a man:
14 1496 But Nature neuer fram'd a womans heart,
14 1497 Of prowder stuffe then that of Beatrice:
14 1498 Disdaine and Scorne ride sparkling in her eyes,
14 1499 Mis-prizing what they looke on, and her wit
14 1500 Values it selfe so highly, that to her
14 1501 All matter else seemes weake: she cannot loue,
14 1502 Nor take no shape nor proiect of affection,
14 1503 Shee is so selfe indeared
14 1504 
14 1505    Vrsula. Sure I thinke so,
14 1506 And therefore certainely it were not good
14 1507 She knew his loue, lest she make sport at it
14 1508 
14 1509    Hero. Why you speake truth, I neuer yet saw man,
14 1510 How wise, how noble, yong, how rarely featur'd.
14 1511 But she would spell him backward: if faire fac'd,
14 1512 She would sweare the gentleman should be her sister:
14 1513 If blacke, why Nature drawing of an anticke,
14 1514 Made a foule blot: if tall, a launce ill headed:
14 1515 If low, an agot very vildlie cut:
14 1516 If speaking, why a vane blowne with all windes:
14 1517 If silent, why a blocke moued with none.
14 1518 So turnes she euery man the wrong side out,
14 1519 And neuer giues to Truth and Vertue, that
14 1520 Which simplenesse and merit purchaseth
14 1521 
14 1522    Vrsu. Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable
14 1523 
14 1524    Hero. No, not to be so odde, and from all fashions,
14 1525 As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable,
14 1526 But who dare tell her so? if I should speake,
14 1527 She would mocke me into ayre, O she would laugh me
14 1528 Out of my selfe, presse me to death with wit,
14 1529 Therefore let Benedicke like couered fire,
14 1530 Consume away in sighes, waste inwardly:
14 1531 It were a better death, to die with mockes,
14 1532 Which is as bad as die with tickling
14 1533 
14 1534    Vrsu. Yet tell her of it, heare what shee will say
14 1535 
14 1536    Hero. No, rather I will goe to Benedicke,
14 1537 And counsaile him to fight against his passion,
14 1538 And truly Ile deuise some honest slanders,
14 1539 To staine my cosin with, one doth not know,
14 1540 How much an ill word may impoison liking
14 1541 
14 1542    Vrsu. O doe not doe your cosin such a wrong,
14 1543 She cannot be so much without true iudgement,
14 1544 Hauing so swift and excellent a wit
14 1545 As she is prisde to haue, as to refuse
14 1546 So rare a Gentleman as signior Benedicke
14 1547 
14 1548    Hero. He is the onely man of Italy,
14 1549 Alwaies excepted, my deare Claudio
14 1550 
14 1551    Vrsu. I pray you be not angry with me, Madame,
14 1552 Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedicke,
14 1553 For shape, for bearing argument and valour,
14 1554 Goes formost in report through Italy
14 1555 
14 1556    Hero. Indeed he hath an excellent good name
14 1557 
14 1558    Vrsu. His excellence did earne it ere he had it:
14 1559 When are you married Madame?
14 1560   Hero. Why euerie day to morrow, come goe in,
14 1561 Ile shew thee some attires, and haue thy counsell,
14 1562 Which is the best to furnish me to morrow
14 1563 
14 1564    Vrsu. Shee's tane I warrant you,
14 1565 We haue caught her Madame?
14 1566   Hero. If it proue so, then louing goes by haps,
14 1567 Some Cupid kills with arrowes, some with traps.
14 1568 Enter.
14 1569 
14 1570   Beat. What fire is in mine eares? can this be true?
14 1571 Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorne so much?
14 1572 Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adew,
14 1573 No glory liues behinde the backe of such.
14 1574 And Benedicke, loue on, I will requite thee,
14 1575 Taming my wilde heart to thy louing hand:
14 1576 If thou dost loue, my kindnesse shall incite thee
14 1577 To binde our loues vp in a holy band.
14 1578 For others say thou dost deserue, and I
14 1579 Beleeue it better then reportingly.
14 1580 Enter.
14 1581 
14 1582 Enter Prince, Claudio, Benedicke, and Leonato.
14 1583 
14 1584   Prince. I doe but stay till your marriage be consummate,
14 1585 and then go I toward Arragon
14 1586 
14 1587    Clau. Ile bring you thither my Lord, if you'l vouchsafe
14 1588 me
14 1589 
14 1590    Prin. Nay, that would be as great a soyle in the new
14 1591 glosse of your marriage, as to shew a childe his new coat
14 1592 and forbid him to weare it, I will onely bee bold with
14 1593 Benedicke for his companie, for from the crowne of his
14 1594 head, to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth, he hath twice
14 1595 or thrice cut Cupids bow-string, and the little hang-man
14 1596 dare not shoot at him, he hath a heart as sound as a bell,
14 1597 and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinkes,
14 1598 his tongue speakes
14 1599 
14 1600    Bene. Gallants, I am not as I haue bin
14 1601 
14 1602    Leo. So say I, methinkes you are sadder
14 1603 
14 1604    Claud. I hope he be in loue
14 1605 
14 1606    Prin. Hang him truant, there's no true drop of bloud
14 1607 in him to be truly toucht with loue, if he be sad, he wants
14 1608 money
14 1609 
14 1610    Bene. I haue the tooth-ach
14 1611 
14 1612    Prin. Draw it
14 1613 
14 1614    Bene. Hang it
14 1615 
14 1616    Claud. You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards
14 1617 
14 1618    Prin. What? sigh for the tooth-ach
14 1619 
14 1620    Leon. Where is but a humour or a worme
14 1621 
14 1622    Bene. Well, euery one cannot master a griefe, but hee
14 1623 that has it
14 1624 
14 1625    Clau. Yet say I, he is in loue
14 1626 
14 1627    Prin. There is no appearance of fancie in him, vnlesse
14 1628 it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to bee a
14 1629 Dutchman to day, a Frenchman to morrow: vnlesse hee
14 1630 haue a fancy to this foolery, as it appeares hee hath, hee
14 1631 is no foole for fancy, as you would haue it to appeare
14 1632 he is
14 1633 
14 1634    Clau. If he be not in loue with some woman, there
14 1635 is no beleeuing old signes, a brushes his hat a mornings,
14 1636 What should that bode?
14 1637   Prin. Hath any man seene him at the Barbers?
14 1638   Clau. No, but the Barbers man hath beene seen with
14 1639 him, and the olde ornament of his cheeke hath alreadie
14 1640 stuft tennis balls
14 1641 
14 1642    Leon. Indeed he lookes yonger than hee did, by the
14 1643 losse of a beard
14 1644 
14 1645    Prin. Nay a rubs himselfe with Ciuit, can you smell
14 1646 him out by that?
14 1647   Clau. That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in
14 1648 loue
14 1649 
14 1650    Prin. The greatest note of it is his melancholy
14 1651 
14 1652    Clau. And when was he wont to wash his face?
14 1653   Prin. Yea, or to paint himselfe? for the which I heare
14 1654 what they say of him
14 1655 
14 1656    Clau. Nay, but his iesting spirit, which is now crept
14 1657 into a lute-string, and now gouern'd by stops
14 1658 
14 1659    Prin. Indeed that tels a heauy tale for him: conclude,
14 1660 he is in loue
14 1661 
14 1662    Clau. Nay, but I know who loues him
14 1663 
14 1664    Prince. That would I know too, I warrant one that
14 1665 knowes him not
14 1666 
14 1667    Cla. Yes, and his ill conditions, and in despight of all,
14 1668 dies for him
14 1669 
14 1670    Prin. Shee shall be buried with her face vpwards
14 1671 
14 1672    Bene. Yet is this no charme for the tooth-ake, old signior,
14 1673 walke aside with mee, I haue studied eight or nine
14 1674 wise words to speake to you, which these hobby-horses
14 1675 must not heare
14 1676 
14 1677    Prin. For my life to breake with him about Beatrice
14 1678 
14 1679    Clau. 'Tis euen so, Hero and Margaret haue by this
14 1680 played their parts with Beatrice, and then the two Beares
14 1681 will not bite one another when they meete.
14 1682 Enter Iohn the Bastard.
14 1683 
14 1684   Bast. My Lord and brother, God saue you
14 1685 
14 1686    Prin. Good den brother
14 1687 
14 1688    Bast. If your leisure seru'd, I would speake with you
14 1689 
14 1690    Prince. In priuate?
14 1691   Bast. If it please you, yet Count Claudio may heare,
14 1692 for what I would speake of, concernes him
14 1693 
14 1694    Prin. What's the matter?
14 1695   Basta. Meanes your Lordship to be married to morrow?
14 1696   Prin. You know he does
14 1697 
14 1698    Bast. I know not that when he knowes what I know
14 1699 
14 1700    Clau. If there be any impediment, I pray you discouer
14 1701 it
14 1702 
14 1703    Bast. You may thinke I loue you not, let that appeare
14 1704 hereafter, and ayme better at me by that I now will manifest,
14 1705 for my brother (I thinke, he holds you well, and in
14 1706 dearenesse of heart) hath holpe to effect your ensuing
14 1707 marriage: surely sute ill spent, and labour ill bestowed
14 1708 
14 1709    Prin. Why, what's the matter?
14 1710   Bastard. I came hither to tell you, and circumstances
14 1711 shortned, (for she hath beene too long a talking of) the
14 1712 Lady is disloyall
14 1713 
14 1714    Clau. Who Hero?
14 1715   Bast. Euen shee, Leonatoes Hero, your Hero, euery
14 1716 mans Hero
14 1717 
14 1718    Clau. Disloyall?
14 1719   Bast. The word is too good to paint out her wickednesse,
14 1720 I could say she were worse, thinke you of a worse
14 1721 title, and I will fit her to it: wonder not till further warrant:
14 1722 goe but with mee to night, you shal see her chamber
14 1723 window entred, euen the night before her wedding
14 1724 day, if you loue her, then to morrow wed her: But it
14 1725 would better fit your honour to change your minde
14 1726 
14 1727    Claud. May this be so?
14 1728   Princ. I will not thinke it
14 1729 
14 1730    Bast. If you dare not trust that you see, confesse not
14 1731 that you know: if you will follow mee, I will shew you
14 1732 enough, and when you haue seene more, & heard more,
14 1733 proceed accordingly
14 1734 
14 1735    Clau. If I see any thing to night, why I should not
14 1736 marry her to morrow in the congregation, where I shold
14 1737 wedde, there will I shame her
14 1738 
14 1739    Prin. And as I wooed for thee to obtaine her, I will
14 1740 ioyne with thee to disgrace her
14 1741 
14 1742    Bast. I will disparage her no farther, till you are my
14 1743 witnesses, beare it coldly but till night, and let the issue
14 1744 shew it selfe
14 1745 
14 1746    Prin. O day vntowardly turned!
14 1747   Claud. O mischiefe strangelie thwarting!
14 1748   Bastard. O plague right well preuented! so will you
14 1749 say, when you haue seene the sequele.
14 1750 Enter.
14 1751 
14 1752 Enter Dogbery and his compartner with the watch.
14 1753 
14 1754   Dog. Are you good men and true?
14 1755   Verg. Yea, or else it were pitty but they should suffer
14 1756 saluation body and soule
14 1757 
14 1758    Dogb. Nay, that were a punishment too good for
14 1759 them, if they should haue any allegiance in them, being
14 1760 chosen for the Princes watch
14 1761 
14 1762    Verges. Well, giue them their charge, neighbour
14 1763 Dogbery
14 1764 
14 1765    Dog. First, who thinke you the most desartlesse man
14 1766 to be Constable
14 1767 
14 1768    Watch.1. Hugh Ote-cake sir, or George Sea-coale, for
14 1769 they can write and reade
14 1770 
14 1771    Dogb. Come hither neighbour Sea-coale, God hath
14 1772 blest you with a good name: to be a wel-fauoured man,
14 1773 is the gift of Fortune, but to write and reade, comes by
14 1774 Nature
14 1775 
14 1776    Watch 2. Both which Master Constable
14 1777   Dogb. You haue: I knew it would be your answere:
14 1778 well, for your fauour sir, why giue God thankes, & make
14 1779 no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that
14 1780 appeare when there is no need of such vanity, you are
14 1781 thought heere to be the most senslesse and fit man for the
14 1782 Constable of the watch: therefore beare you the lanthorne:
14 1783 this is your charge: You shall comprehend all
14 1784 vagrom men, you are to bid any man stand in the Princes
14 1785 name
14 1786 
14 1787    Watch 2. How if a will not stand?
14 1788   Dogb. Why then take no note of him, but let him go,
14 1789 and presently call the rest of the Watch together, and
14 1790 thanke God you are ridde of a knaue
14 1791 
14 1792    Verges. If he will not stand when he is bidden, hee is
14 1793 none of the Princes subiects
14 1794 
14 1795    Dogb. True, and they are to meddle with none but
14 1796 the Princes subiects: you shall also make no noise in the
14 1797 streetes: for, for the Watch to babble and talke, is most
14 1798 tollerable, and not to be indured
14 1799 
14 1800    Watch. We will rather sleepe than talke, wee know
14 1801 what belongs to a Watch
14 1802 
14 1803    Dog. Why you speake like an ancient and most quiet
14 1804 watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend:
14 1805 only haue a care that your bills be not stolne: well, you
14 1806 are to call at all the Alehouses, and bid them that are
14 1807 drunke get them to bed
14 1808 
14 1809    Watch. How if they will not?
14 1810   Dogb. Why then let them alone till they are sober, if
14 1811 they make you not then the better answere, you may say,
14 1812 they are not the men you tooke them for
14 1813 
14 1814    Watch. Well sir,
14 1815   Dogb. If you meet a theefe, you may suspect him, by
14 1816 vertue of your office, to be no true man: and for such
14 1817 kinde of men, the lesse you meddle or make with them,
14 1818 why the more is for your honesty
14 1819 
14 1820    Watch. If wee know him to be a thiefe, shall wee not
14 1821 lay hands on him
14 1822 
14 1823    Dogb. Truly by your office you may, but I think they
14 1824 that touch pitch will be defil'd: the most peaceable way
14 1825 for you, if you doe take a theefe, is, to let him shew himselfe
14 1826 what he is, and steale out of your company
14 1827 
14 1828    Ver. You haue bin alwaies cal'd a merciful ma[n] partner
14 1829 
14 1830    Dog. Truely I would not hang a dog by my will, much
14 1831 more a man who hath anie honestie in him
14 1832 
14 1833    Verges. If you heare a child crie in the night you must
14 1834 call to the nurse, and bid her still it
14 1835 
14 1836    Watch. How if the nurse be asleepe and will not
14 1837 heare vs?
14 1838   Dog. Why then depart in peace, and let the childe
14 1839 wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not heare
14 1840 her Lambe when it baes, will neuer answere a calfe when
14 1841 he bleates
14 1842 
14 1843    Verges. 'Tis verie true
14 1844 
14 1845    Dog. This is the end of the charge: you constable
14 1846 are to present the Princes owne person, if you meete the
14 1847 Prince in the night, you may staie him
14 1848 
14 1849    Verges. Nay birladie that I thinke a cannot
14 1850 
14 1851    Dog. Fiue shillings to one on't with anie man that
14 1852 knowes the Statutes, he may staie him, marrie not without
14 1853 the prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to
14 1854 offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against
14 1855 his will
14 1856 
14 1857    Verges. Birladie I thinke it be so
14 1858 
14 1859    Dog. Ha, ah ha, well masters good night, and there be
14 1860 anie matter of weight chances, call vp me, keepe your
14 1861 fellowes counsailes, and your owne, and good night,
14 1862 come neighbour
14 1863 
14 1864    Watch. Well masters, we heare our charge, let vs go
14 1865 sit here vpon the Church bench till two, and then all to
14 1866 bed
14 1867 
14 1868    Dog. One word more, honest neighbors. I pray you
14 1869 watch about signior Leonatoes doore, for the wedding being
14 1870 there to morrow, there is a great coyle to night,
14 1871 adiew, be vigitant I beseech you.
14 1872 
14 1873 Exeunt.
14 1874 
14 1875 Enter Borachio and Conrade.
14 1876 
14 1877   Bor. What, Conrade?
14 1878   Watch. Peace, stir not
14 1879 
14 1880    Bor. Conrade I say
14 1881 
14 1882    Con. Here man, I am at thy elbow
14 1883 
14 1884    Bor. Mas and my elbow itcht, I thought there would
14 1885 a scabbe follow
14 1886 
14 1887    Con. I will owe thee an answere for that, and now
14 1888 forward with thy tale
14 1889 
14 1890    Bor. Stand thee close then vnder this penthouse, for it
14 1891 drissels raine, and I will, like a true drunkard, vtter all to
14 1892 thee
14 1893 
14 1894    Watch. Some treason masters, yet stand close
14 1895 
14 1896    Bor. Therefore know, I haue earned of Don Iohn a
14 1897 thousand Ducates
14 1898 
14 1899    Con. Is it possible that anie villanie should be so deare?
14 1900   Bor. Thou should'st rather aske if it were possible anie
14 1901 villanie should be so rich? for when rich villains haue
14 1902 neede of poore ones, poore ones may make what price
14 1903 they will
14 1904 
14 1905    Con. I wonder at it
14 1906 
14 1907    Bor. That shewes thou art vnconfirm'd, thou knowest
14 1908 that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloake, is nothing
14 1909 to a man
14 1910 
14 1911    Con. Yes, it is apparell
14 1912 
14 1913    Bor. I meane the fashion
14 1914 
14 1915    Con. Yes the fashion is the fashion
14 1916 
14 1917    Bor. Tush, I may as well say the foole's the foole, but
14 1918 seest thou not what a deformed theefe this fashion is?
14 1919   Watch. I know that deformed, a has bin a vile theefe,
14 1920 this vii. yeares, a goes vp and downe like a gentle man:
14 1921 I remember his name
14 1922 
14 1923    Bor. Did'st thou not heare some bodie?
14 1924   Con. No, 'twas the vaine on the house
14 1925 
14 1926    Bor. Seest thou not (I say) what a deformed thiefe
14 1927 this fashion is, how giddily a turnes about all the Hotblouds,
14 1928 betweene, foureteene & fiue & thirtie, sometimes
14 1929 fashioning them like Pharaoes souldiours in the rechie
14 1930 painting, sometime like god Bels priests in the old
14 1931 Church window, sometime like the shauen Hercules in
14 1932 the smircht worm-eaten tapestrie, where his cod-peece
14 1933 seemes as massie as his club
14 1934 
14 1935    Con. All this I see, and see that the fashion weares out
14 1936 more apparrell then the man; but art not thou thy selfe
14 1937 giddie with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of
14 1938 thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
14 1939   Bor. Not so neither, but know that I haue to night
14 1940 wooed Margaret the Lady Heroes gentle-woman, by the
14 1941 name of Hero, she leanes me out at her mistris chamberwindow,
14 1942 bids me a thousand times good night: I tell
14 1943 this tale vildly. I should first tell thee how the Prince
14 1944 Claudio and my Master planted, and placed, and possessed
14 1945 by my Master Don Iohn, saw a far off in the Orchard this
14 1946 amiable incounter
14 1947 
14 1948    Con. And thought thy Margaret was Hero?
14 1949   Bor. Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio, but the
14 1950 diuell my Master knew she was Margaret and partly by
14 1951 his oathes, which first possest them, partly by the darke
14 1952 night which did deceiue them, but chiefely, by my villanie,
14 1953 which did confirme any slander that Don Iohn had
14 1954 made, away went Claudio enraged, swore hee would
14 1955 meete her as he was apointed next morning at the Temple,
14 1956 and there, before the whole congregation shame her
14 1957 with what he saw o're night, and send her home againe
14 1958 without a husband
14 1959 
14 1960    Watch.1. We charge you in the Princes name stand
14 1961 
14 1962    Watch.2. Call vp the right master Constable, we haue
14 1963 here recouered the most dangerous peece of lechery, that
14 1964 euer was knowne in the Common-wealth
14 1965 
14 1966    Watch.1. And one Deformed is one of them, I know
14 1967 him, a weares a locke
14 1968 
14 1969    Conr. Masters, masters
14 1970 
14 1971    Watch.2. Youle be made bring deformed forth I warrant
14 1972 you,
14 1973   Conr. Masters, neuer speake, we charge you, let vs obey
14 1974 you to goe with vs
14 1975 
14 1976    Bor. We are like to proue a goodly commoditie, being
14 1977 taken vp of these mens bils
14 1978 
14 1979    Conr. A commoditie in question I warrant you, come
14 1980 weele obey you.
14 1981 
14 1982 Exeunt.
14 1983 
14 1984 Enter Hero, and Margaret, and Vrsula.
14 1985 
14 1986   Hero. Good Vrsula wake my cosin Beatrice, and desire
14 1987 her to rise
14 1988 
14 1989    Vrsu. I will Lady
14 1990 
14 1991    Her. And bid her come hither
14 1992 
14 1993    Vrs. Well
14 1994 
14 1995    Mar. Troth I thinke your other rebato were better
14 1996 
14 1997    Hero. No pray thee good Meg, Ile weare this
14 1998 
14 1999    Marg. By my troth's not so good, and I warrant your
14 2000 cosin will say so
14 2001 
14 2002    Hero. My cosin's a foole, and thou art another, ile
14 2003 weare none but this
14 2004 
14 2005    Mar. I like the new tire within excellently, if the
14 2006 haire were a thought browner: and your gown's a most
14 2007 rare fashion yfaith, I saw the Dutchesse of Millaines
14 2008 gowne that they praise so
14 2009 
14 2010    Hero. O that exceedes they say
14 2011 
14 2012    Mar. By my troth's but a night-gowne in respect of
14 2013 yours, cloth a gold and cuts, and lac'd with siluer, set with
14 2014 pearles, downe sleeues, side sleeues, and skirts, round vnderborn
14 2015 with a blewish tinsel, but for a fine queint gracefull
14 2016 and excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on't
14 2017 
14 2018    Hero. God giue mee ioy to weare it, for my heart is
14 2019 exceeding heauy
14 2020 
14 2021    Marga. 'Twill be heauier soone, by the waight of a
14 2022 man
14 2023 
14 2024    Hero. Fie vpon thee, art not asham'd?
14 2025   Marg. Of what Lady? of speaking honourably? is
14 2026 not marriage honourable in a beggar? is not your Lord
14 2027 honourable without marriage? I thinke you would haue
14 2028 me say, sauing your reuerence a husband: and bad thinking
14 2029 doe not wrest true speaking, Ile offend no body, is
14 2030 there any harme in the heauier for a husband? none I
14 2031 thinke, and it be the right husband, and the right wife,
14 2032 otherwise 'tis light and not heauy, aske my Lady Beatrice
14 2033 else, here she comes.
14 2034 Enter Beatrice.
14 2035 
14 2036   Hero. Good morrow Coze
14 2037 
14 2038    Beat. Good morrow sweet Hero
14 2039 
14 2040    Hero. Why how now? do you speake in the sick tune?
14 2041   Beat. I am out of all other tune, me thinkes
14 2042 
14 2043    Mar. Claps into Light a loue, (that goes without a
14 2044 burden,) do you sing it and Ile dance it
14 2045 
14 2046    Beat. Ye Light aloue with your heeles, then if your
14 2047 husband haue stables enough, you'll looke he shall lacke
14 2048 no barnes
14 2049 
14 2050    Mar. O illegitimate construction! I scorne that with
14 2051 my heeles
14 2052 
14 2053    Beat. 'Tis almost fiue a clocke cosin, 'tis time you
14 2054 were ready, by my troth I am exceeding ill, hey ho
14 2055 
14 2056    Mar. For a hauke, a horse, or a husband?
14 2057   Beat. For the letter that begins them all, H
14 2058 
14 2059    Mar. Well, and you be not turn'd Turke, there's no
14 2060 more sayling by the starre
14 2061 
14 2062    Beat. What meanes the foole trow?
14 2063   Mar. Nothing I, but God send euery one their harts
14 2064 desire
14 2065 
14 2066    Hero. These gloues the Count sent mee, they are an
14 2067 excellent perfume
14 2068 
14 2069    Beat. I am stuft cosin, I cannot smell
14 2070 
14 2071    Mar. A maid and stuft! there's goodly catching of
14 2072 colde
14 2073 
14 2074    Beat. O God helpe me, God help me, how long haue
14 2075 you profest apprehension?
14 2076   Mar. Euer since you left it, doth not my wit become
14 2077 me rarely?
14 2078   Beat. It is not seene enough, you should weare it in
14 2079 your cap, by my troth I am sicke
14 2080 
14 2081    Mar. Get you some of this distill'd carduus benedictus
14 2082 and lay it to your heart, it is the onely thing for a qualm
14 2083 
14 2084    Hero. There thou prick'st her with a thissell
14 2085 
14 2086    Beat. Benedictus, why benedictus? you haue some morall
14 2087 in this benedictus
14 2088 
14 2089    Mar. Morall? no by my troth, I haue no morall meaning,
14 2090 I meant plaine holy thissell, you may thinke perchance
14 2091 that I thinke you are in loue, nay birlady I am not
14 2092 such a foole to thinke what I list, nor I list not to thinke
14 2093 what I can, nor indeed, I cannot thinke, if I would thinke
14 2094 my hart out of thinking, that you are in loue, or that you
14 2095 will be in loue, or that you can be in loue: yet Benedicke
14 2096 was such another, and now is he become a man, he swore
14 2097 hee would neuer marry, and yet now in despight of his
14 2098 heart he eates his meat without grudging, and how you
14 2099 may be conuerted I know not, but me thinkes you looke
14 2100 with your eies as other women doe
14 2101 
14 2102    Beat. What pace is this that thy tongue keepes
14 2103 
14 2104    Mar. Not a false gallop.
14 2105 Enter Vrsula.
14 2106 
14 2107   Vrsula. Madam, withdraw, the Prince, the Count, signior
14 2108 Benedicke, Don Iohn, and all the gallants of the
14 2109 towne are come to fetch you to Church
14 2110 
14 2111    Hero. Helpe me to dresse mee good coze, good Meg,
14 2112 good Vrsula.
14 2113 Enter Leonato, and the Constable, and the Headborough.
14 2114 
14 2115   Leonato. What would you with mee, honest neighbour?
14 2116   Const.Dog. Mary sir I would haue some confidence
14 2117 with you, that decernes you nearely
14 2118 
14 2119    Leon. Briefe I pray you, for you see it is a busie time
14 2120 with me
14 2121 
14 2122    Const.Dog. Mary this it is sir
14 2123 
14 2124    Headb. Yes in truth it is sir
14 2125 
14 2126    Leon. What is it my good friends?
14 2127   Con.Do. Goodman Verges sir speakes a little of the
14 2128 matter, an old man sir, and his wits are not so blunt, as
14 2129 God helpe I would desire they were, but infaith honest
14 2130 as the skin betweene his browes
14 2131 
14 2132    Head. Yes I thank God, I am as honest as any man liuing,
14 2133 that is an old man, and no honester then I
14 2134 
14 2135    Con.Dog. Comparisons are odorous, palabras, neighbour
14 2136 Verges
14 2137 
14 2138    Leon. Neighbours, you are tedious
14 2139 
14 2140    Con.Dog. It pleases your worship to say so, but we are
14 2141 the poore Dukes officers, but truely for mine owne part,
14 2142 if I were as tedious as a King I could finde in my heart to
14 2143 bestow it all of your worship
14 2144 
14 2145    Leon. All thy tediousnesse on me, ah?
14 2146   Const.Dog. Yea, and 'twere a thousand times more
14 2147 than 'tis, for I heare as good exclamation on your Worship
14 2148 as of any man in the Citie, and though I bee but a
14 2149 poore man, I am glad to heare it
14 2150 
14 2151    Head. And so am I
14 2152 
14 2153    Leon. I would faine know what you haue to say
14 2154 
14 2155    Head. Marry sir our watch to night, excepting your
14 2156 worships presence, haue tane a couple of as arrant
14 2157 knaues as any in Messina
14 2158 
14 2159    Con.Dog. A good old man sir, hee will be talking as
14 2160 they say, when the age is in, the wit is out, God helpe vs,
14 2161 it is a world to see: well said yfaith neighbour Verges,
14 2162 well, God's a good man, and two men ride of a horse,
14 2163 one must ride behinde, an honest soule yfaith sir, by my
14 2164 troth he is, as euer broke bread, but God is to bee worshipt,
14 2165 all men are not alike, alas good neighbour
14 2166 
14 2167    Leon. Indeed neighbour he comes too short of you
14 2168 
14 2169    Con.Do. Gifts that God giues
14 2170 
14 2171    Leon. I must leaue you
14 2172 
14 2173    Con.Dog. One word sir, our watch sir haue indeede
14 2174 comprehended two aspitious persons, & we would haue
14 2175 them this morning examined before your worship
14 2176 
14 2177    Leon. Take their examination your selfe, and bring it
14 2178 me, I am now in great haste, as may appeare vnto you
14 2179 
14 2180    Const. It shall be suffigance
14 2181 
14 2182    Leon. Drinke some wine ere you goe: fare you well.
14 2183 Enter.
14 2184 
14 2185   Messenger. My Lord, they stay for you to giue your
14 2186 daughter to her husband
14 2187 
14 2188    Leon. Ile wait vpon them, I am ready
14 2189 
14 2190    Dogb. Goe good partner, goe get you to Francis Seacoale,
14 2191 bid him bring his pen and inkehorne to the Gaole:
14 2192 we are now to examine those men
14 2193 
14 2194    Verges. And we must doe it wisely
14 2195 
14 2196    Dogb. Wee will spare for no witte I warrant you:
14 2197 heere's that shall driue some to a non-come, only
14 2198 get the learned writer to set downe our excommunication,
14 2199 and meet me at the Iaile.
14 2200 
14 2201 Exeunt.
14 2202 
14 2203 
14 2204 Actus Quartus.
14 2205 
14 2206 Enter Prince, Bastard, Leonato, Frier, Claudio, Benedicke, Hero,
14 2207 and
14 2208 Beatrice.
14 2209 
14 2210   Leonato. Come Frier Francis, be briefe, onely to the
14 2211 plaine forme of marriage, and you shal recount their particular
14 2212 duties afterwards
14 2213 
14 2214    Fran. You come hither, my Lord, to marry this Lady
14 2215 
14 2216    Clau. No
14 2217 
14 2218    Leo. To be married to her: Frier, you come to marrie
14 2219 her
14 2220 
14 2221    Frier. Lady, you come hither to be married to this
14 2222 Count
14 2223 
14 2224    Hero. I doe
14 2225 
14 2226    Frier. If either of you know any inward impediment
14 2227 why you should not be conioyned, I charge you on your
14 2228 soules to vtter it
14 2229 
14 2230    Claud. Know you anie, Hero?
14 2231   Hero. None my Lord
14 2232 
14 2233    Frier. Know you anie, Count?
14 2234   Leon. I dare make his answer, None
14 2235 
14 2236    Clau. O what men dare do! what men may do! what
14 2237 men daily do!
14 2238   Bene. How now! interiections? why then, some be
14 2239 of laughing, as ha, ha, he
14 2240 
14 2241    Clau. Stand thee by Frier, father, by your leaue,
14 2242 Will you with free and vnconstrained soule
14 2243 Giue me this maid your daughter?
14 2244   Leon. As freely sonne as God did giue her me
14 2245 
14 2246    Cla. And what haue I to giue you back, whose worth
14 2247 May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
14 2248   Prin. Nothing, vnlesse you render her againe
14 2249 
14 2250    Clau. Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulnes:
14 2251 There Leonato, take her backe againe,
14 2252 Giue not this rotten Orenge to your friend,
14 2253 Shee's but the signe and semblance of her honour:
14 2254 Behold how like a maid she blushes heere!
14 2255 O what authoritie and shew of truth
14 2256 Can cunning sinne couer it selfe withall!
14 2257 Comes not that bloud, as modest euidence,
14 2258 To witnesse simple Vertue? would you not sweare
14 2259 All you that see her, that she were a maide,
14 2260 By these exterior shewes? But she is none:
14 2261 She knowes the heat of a luxurious bed:
14 2262 Her blush is guiltinesse, not modestie
14 2263 
14 2264    Leonato. What doe you meane, my Lord?
14 2265   Clau. Not to be married,
14 2266 Not to knit my soule to an approued wanton
14 2267 
14 2268    Leon. Deere my Lord, if you in your owne proofe,
14 2269 Haue vanquisht the resistance of her youth,
14 2270 And made defeat of her virginitie
14 2271 
14 2272    Clau. I know what you would say: if I haue knowne
14 2273 (her,
14 2274 You will say, she did imbrace me as a husband,
14 2275 And so extenuate the forehand sinne: No Leonato,
14 2276 I neuer tempted her with word too large,
14 2277 But as a brother to his sister, shewed
14 2278 Bashfull sinceritie and comely loue
14 2279 
14 2280    Hero. And seem'd I euer otherwise to you?
14 2281   Clau. Out on thee seeming, I will write against it,
14 2282 You seeme to me as Diane in her Orbe,
14 2283 As chaste as is the budde ere it be blowne:
14 2284 But you are more intemperate in your blood,
14 2285 Than Venus, or those pampred animalls,
14 2286 That rage in sauage sensualitie
14 2287 
14 2288    Hero. Is my Lord well, that he doth speake so wide?
14 2289   Leon. Sweete Prince, why speake not you?
14 2290   Prin. What should I speake?
14 2291 I stand dishonour'd that haue gone about,
14 2292 To linke my deare friend to a common stale
14 2293 
14 2294    Leon. Are these things spoken, or doe I but dreame?
14 2295   Bast. Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true
14 2296 
14 2297    Bene. This lookes not like a nuptiall
14 2298 
14 2299    Hero. True, O God!
14 2300   Clau. Leonato, stand I here?
14 2301 Is this the Prince? is this the Princes brother?
14 2302 Is this face Heroes? are our eies our owne?
14 2303   Leon. All this is so, but what of this my Lord?
14 2304   Clau. Let me but moue one question to your daughter,
14 2305 And by that fatherly and kindly power,
14 2306 That you haue in her, bid her answer truly
14 2307 
14 2308    Leo. I charge thee doe, as thou art my childe
14 2309 
14 2310    Hero. O God defend me how am I beset,
14 2311 What kinde of catechizing call you this?
14 2312   Clau. To make you answer truly to your name
14 2313 
14 2314    Hero. Is it not Hero? who can blot that name
14 2315 With any iust reproach?
14 2316   Claud. Marry that can Hero,
14 2317 Hero it selfe can blot out Heroes vertue.
14 2318 What man was he, talkt with you yesternight,
14 2319 Out at your window betwixt twelue and one?
14 2320 Now if you are a maid, answer to this
14 2321 
14 2322    Hero. I talkt with no man at that howre my Lord
14 2323 
14 2324    Prince. Why then you are no maiden. Leonato,
14 2325 I am sorry you must heare: vpon mine honor,
14 2326 My selfe, my brother, and this grieued Count
14 2327 Did see her, heare her, at that howre last night,
14 2328 Talke with a ruffian at her chamber window,
14 2329 Who hath indeed most like a liberall villaine,
14 2330 Confest the vile encounters they haue had
14 2331 A thousand times in secret
14 2332 
14 2333    Iohn. Fie, fie, they are not to be named my Lord,
14 2334 Not to be spoken of,
14 2335 There is not chastitie enough in language,
14 2336 Without offence to vtter them: thus pretty Lady
14 2337 I am sorry for thy much misgouernment
14 2338 
14 2339    Claud. O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou beene
14 2340 If halfe thy outward graces had beene placed
14 2341 About thy thoughts and counsailes of thy heart?
14 2342 But fare thee well, most foule, most faire, farewell
14 2343 Thou pure impiety, and impious puritie,
14 2344 For thee Ile locke vp all the gates of Loue,
14 2345 And on my eie-lids shall Coniecture hang,
14 2346 To turne all beauty into thoughts of harme,
14 2347 And neuer shall it more be gracious
14 2348 
14 2349    Leon. Hath no mans dagger here a point for me?
14 2350   Beat. Why how now cosin, wherfore sink you down?
14 2351   Bast. Come, let vs go: these things come thus to light,
14 2352 Smother her spirits vp
14 2353 
14 2354    Bene. How doth the Lady?
14 2355   Beat. Dead I thinke, helpe vncle,
14 2356 Hero, why Hero, Vncle, Signor Benedicke, Frier
14 2357 
14 2358    Leonato. O Fate! take not away thy heauy hand,
14 2359 Death is the fairest couer for her shame
14 2360 That may be wisht for
14 2361 
14 2362    Beatr. How now cosin Hero?
14 2363   Fri. Haue comfort Ladie
14 2364 
14 2365    Leon. Dost thou looke vp?
14 2366   Frier. Yea, wherefore should she not?
14 2367   Leon. Wherfore? Why doth not euery earthly thing
14 2368 Cry shame vpon her? Could she heere denie
14 2369 The storie that is printed in her blood?
14 2370 Do not liue Hero, do not ope thine eyes:
14 2371 For did I thinke thou wouldst not quickly die,
14 2372 Thought I thy spirits were stronger then thy shames,
14 2373 My selfe would on the reward of reproaches
14 2374 Strike at thy life. Grieu'd I, I had but one?
14 2375 Chid I, for that at frugal Natures frame?
14 2376 O one too much by thee: why had I one?
14 2377 Why euer was't thou louelie in my eies?
14 2378 Why had I not with charitable hand
14 2379 Tooke vp a beggars issue at my gates,
14 2380 Who smeered thus, and mir'd with infamie,
14 2381 I might haue said, no part of it is mine:
14 2382 This shame deriues it selfe from vnknowne loines,
14 2383 But mine, and mine I lou'd, and mine I prais'd,
14 2384 And mine that I was proud on mine so much,
14 2385 That I my selfe, was to my selfe not mine:
14 2386 Valewing of her, why she, O she is falne
14 2387 Into a pit of Inke, that the wide sea
14 2388 Hath drops too few to wash her cleane againe,
14 2389 And salt too little, which may season giue
14 2390 To her foule tainted flesh
14 2391 
14 2392    Ben. Sir, sir, be patient: for my part, I am so attired
14 2393 in wonder, I know not what to say
14 2394 
14 2395    Bea. O on my soule my cosin is belied
14 2396 
14 2397    Ben. Ladie, were you her bedfellow last night?
14 2398   Bea. No, truly: not although vntill last night,
14 2399 I haue this tweluemonth bin her bedfellow
14 2400 
14 2401    Leon. Confirm'd, confirm'd, O that is stronger made
14 2402 Which was before barr'd vp with ribs of iron.
14 2403 Would the Princes lie, and Claudio lie,
14 2404 Who lou'd her so, that speaking of her foulnesse,
14 2405 Wash'd it with teares? Hence from her, let her die
14 2406 
14 2407    Fri. Heare me a little, for I haue onely bene silent so
14 2408 long, and giuen way vnto this course of fortune, by noting
14 2409 of the Ladie, I haue markt.
14 2410 A thousand blushing apparitions,
14 2411 To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames,
14 2412 In Angel whitenesse beare away those blushes,
14 2413 And in her eie there hath appear'd a fire
14 2414 To burne the errors that these Princes hold
14 2415 Against her maiden truth. Call me a foole,
14 2416 Trust not my reading, nor my obseruations,
14 2417 Which with experimental seale doth warrant
14 2418 The tenure of my booke: trust not my age,
14 2419 My reuerence, calling, nor diuinitie,
14 2420 If this sweet Ladie lye not guiltlesse heere,
14 2421 Vnder some biting error
14 2422 
14 2423    Leo. Friar, it cannot be:
14 2424 Thou seest that all the Grace that she hath left,
14 2425 Is, that she wil not adde to her damnation,
14 2426 A sinne of periury, she not denies it:
14 2427 Why seek'st thou then to couer with excuse,
14 2428 That which appeares in proper nakednesse?
14 2429   Fri. Ladie, what man is he you are accus'd of?
14 2430   Hero. They know that do accuse me, I know none:
14 2431 If I know more of any man aliue
14 2432 Then that which maiden modestie doth warrant,
14 2433 Let all my sinnes lacke mercy. O my Father,
14 2434 Proue you that any man with me conuerst,
14 2435 At houres vnmeete, or that I yesternight
14 2436 Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
14 2437 Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death
14 2438 
14 2439    Fri. There is some strange misprision in the Princes
14 2440 
14 2441    Ben. Two of them haue the verie bent of honor,
14 2442 And if their wisedomes be misled in this:
14 2443 The practise of it liues in Iohn the bastard,
14 2444 Whose spirits toile in frame of villanies
14 2445 
14 2446    Leo. I know not: if they speake but truth of her,
14 2447 These hands shall teare her: If they wrong her honour,
14 2448 The proudest of them shall wel heare of it.
14 2449 Time hath not yet so dried this bloud of mine,
14 2450 Nor age so eate vp my inuention,
14 2451 Nor Fortune made such hauocke of my meanes,
14 2452 Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
14 2453 But they shall finde, awak'd in such a kinde,
14 2454 Both strength of limbe, and policie of minde,
14 2455 Ability in meanes, and choise of friends,
14 2456 To quit me of them throughly
14 2457 
14 2458    Fri. Pause awhile:
14 2459 And let my counsell sway you in this case,
14 2460 Your daughter heere the Princesse (left for dead)
14 2461 Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
14 2462 And publish it, that she is dead indeed:
14 2463 Maintaine a mourning ostentation,
14 2464 And on your Families old monument,
14 2465 Hang mournfull Epitaphes, and do all rites,
14 2466 That appertaine vnto a buriall
14 2467 
14 2468    Leon. What shall become of this? What wil this do?
14 2469   Fri. Marry this wel carried, shall on her behalfe,
14 2470 Change slander to remorse, that is some good,
14 2471 But not for that dreame I on this strange course,
14 2472 But on this trauaile looke for greater birth:
14 2473 She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
14 2474 Vpon the instant that she was accus'd,
14 2475 Shal be lamented, pittied, and excus'd
14 2476 Of euery hearer: for it so fals out,
14 2477 That what we haue, we prize not to the worth,
14 2478 Whiles we enioy it; but being lack'd and lost,
14 2479 Why then we racke the value, then we finde
14 2480 The vertue that possession would not shew vs
14 2481 Whiles it was ours, so will it fare with Claudio:
14 2482 When he shal heare she dyed vpon his words,
14 2483 Th' Idea of her life shal sweetly creepe
14 2484 Into his study of imagination.
14 2485 And euery louely Organ of her life,
14 2486 Shall come apparel'd in more precious habite:
14 2487 More mouing delicate, and ful of life,
14 2488 Into the eye and prospect of his soule
14 2489 Then when she liu'd indeed: then shal he mourne,
14 2490 If euer Loue had interest in his Liuer,
14 2491 And wish he had not so accused her:
14 2492 No, though he thought his accusation true:
14 2493 Let this be so, and doubt not but successe
14 2494 Wil fashion the euent in better shape,
14 2495 Then I can lay it downe in likelihood.
14 2496 But if all ayme but this be leuelld false,
14 2497 The supposition of the Ladies death,
14 2498 Will quench the wonder of her infamie.
14 2499 And if it sort not well, you may conceale her
14 2500 As best befits her wounded reputation,
14 2501 In some reclusiue and religious life,
14 2502 Out of all eyes, tongues, mindes and iniuries
14 2503 
14 2504    Bene. Signior Leonato, let the Frier aduise you,
14 2505 And though you know my inwardnesse and loue
14 2506 Is very much vnto the Prince and Claudio.
14 2507 Yet, by mine honor, I will deale in this,
14 2508 As secretly and iustlie, as your soule
14 2509 Should with your bodie
14 2510 
14 2511    Leon. Being that I flow in greefe,
14 2512 The smallest twine may lead me
14 2513 
14 2514    Frier. 'Tis well consented, presently away,
14 2515 For to strange sores, strangely they straine the cure,
14 2516 Come Lady, die to liue, this wedding day
14 2517 Perhaps is but prolong'd, haue patience & endure.
14 2518 Enter.
14 2519 
14 2520   Bene. Lady Beatrice, haue you wept all this while?
14 2521   Beat. Yea, and I will weepe a while longer
14 2522 
14 2523    Bene. I will not desire that
14 2524 
14 2525    Beat. You haue no reason, I doe it freely
14 2526 
14 2527    Bene. Surelie I do beleeue your fair cosin is wrong'd
14 2528 
14 2529    Beat. Ah, how much might the man deserue of mee
14 2530 that would right her!
14 2531   Bene. Is there any way to shew such friendship?
14 2532   Beat. A verie euen way, but no such friend
14 2533 
14 2534    Bene. May a man doe it?
14 2535   Beat. It is a mans office, but not yours
14 2536 
14 2537    Bene. I doe loue nothing in the world so well as you,
14 2538 is not that strange?
14 2539   Beat. As strange as the thing I know not, it were as
14 2540 possible for me to say, I loued nothing so well as you, but
14 2541 beleeue me not, and yet I lie not, I confesse nothing, nor
14 2542 I deny nothing, I am sorry for my cousin
14 2543 
14 2544    Bene. By my sword Beatrice thou lou'st me
14 2545 
14 2546    Beat. Doe not sweare by it and eat it
14 2547 
14 2548    Bene. I will sweare by it that you loue mee, and I will
14 2549 make him eat it that sayes I loue not you
14 2550 
14 2551    Beat. Will you not eat your word?
14 2552   Bene. With no sawce that can be deuised to it, I protest
14 2553 I loue thee
14 2554 
14 2555    Beat. Why then God forgiue me
14 2556 
14 2557    Bene. What offence sweet Beatrice?
14 2558   Beat. You haue stayed me in a happy howre, I was about
14 2559 to protest I loued you
14 2560 
14 2561    Bene. And doe it with all thy heart
14 2562 
14 2563    Beat. I loue you with so much of my heart, that none
14 2564 is left to protest
14 2565 
14 2566    Bened. Come, bid me doe any thing for thee
14 2567 
14 2568    Beat. Kill Claudio
14 2569 
14 2570    Bene. Ha, not for the wide world
14 2571 
14 2572    Beat. You kill me to denie, farewell
14 2573 
14 2574    Bene. Tarrie sweet Beatrice
14 2575 
14 2576    Beat. I am gone, though I am heere, there is no loue
14 2577 in you, nay I pray you let me goe
14 2578 
14 2579    Bene. Beatrice
14 2580 
14 2581    Beat. Infaith I will goe
14 2582 
14 2583    Bene. Wee'll be friends first
14 2584 
14 2585    Beat. You dare easier be friends with mee, than fight
14 2586 with mine enemy
14 2587 
14 2588    Bene. Is Claudio thine enemie?
14 2589   Beat. Is a not approued in the height a villaine, that
14 2590 hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
14 2591 that I were a man! what, beare her in hand vntill they
14 2592 come to take hands, and then with publike accusation
14 2593 vncouered slander, vnmittigated rancour? O God that I
14 2594 were a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place
14 2595 
14 2596    Bene. Heare me Beatrice
14 2597 
14 2598    Beat. Talke with a man out at a window, a proper
14 2599 saying
14 2600 
14 2601    Bene. Nay but Beatrice
14 2602 
14 2603    Beat. Sweet Hero, she is wrong'd, shee is slandered,
14 2604 she is vndone
14 2605 
14 2606    Bene. Beat?
14 2607   Beat. Princes and Counties! surelie a Princely testimonie,
14 2608 a goodly Count, Comfect, a sweet Gallant surelie,
14 2609 O that I were a man for his sake! or that I had any
14 2610 friend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted
14 2611 into cursies, valour into complement, and men are
14 2612 onelie turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now
14 2613 as valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie, and sweares it:
14 2614 I cannot be a man with wishing, therfore I will die a woman
14 2615 with grieuing
14 2616 
14 2617    Bene. Tarry good Beatrice, by this hand I loue thee
14 2618 
14 2619    Beat. Vse it for my loue some other way then swearing
14 2620 by it
14 2621 
14 2622    Bened. Thinke you in your soule the Count Claudio
14 2623 hath wrong'd Hero?
14 2624   Beat. Yea, as sure as I haue a thought, or a soule
14 2625 
14 2626    Bene. Enough, I am engagde, I will challenge him, I
14 2627 will kisse your hand, and so leaue you: by this hand Claudio
14 2628 shall render me a deere account: as you heare of me,
14 2629 so thinke of me: goe comfort your coosin, I must say she
14 2630 is dead, and so farewell.
14 2631 Enter the Constables, Borachio, and the Towne Clerke in gownes.
14 2632 
14 2633   Keeper. Is our whole dissembly appeard?
14 2634   Cowley. O a stoole and a cushion for the Sexton
14 2635 
14 2636    Sexton. Which be the malefactors?
14 2637   Andrew. Marry that am I, and my partner
14 2638 
14 2639    Cowley. Nay that's certaine, wee haue the exhibition
14 2640 to examine
14 2641 
14 2642    Sexton. But which are the offenders that are to be examined,
14 2643 let them come before master Constable
14 2644 
14 2645    Kemp. Yea marry, let them come before mee, what is
14 2646 your name, friend?
14 2647   Bor. Borachio
14 2648 
14 2649    Kem. Pray write downe Borachio. Yours sirra
14 2650 
14 2651    Con. I am a Gentleman sir, and my name is Conrade
14 2652 
14 2653    Kee. Write downe Master gentleman Conrade: maisters,
14 2654 doe you serue God: maisters, it is proued alreadie
14 2655 that you are little better than false knaues, and it will goe
14 2656 neere to be thought so shortly, how answer you for your
14 2657 selues?
14 2658   Con. Marry sir, we say we are none
14 2659 
14 2660    Kemp. A maruellous witty fellow I assure you, but I
14 2661 will goe about with him: come you hither sirra, a word
14 2662 in your eare sir, I say to you, it is thought you are false
14 2663 knaues
14 2664 
14 2665    Bor. Sir, I say to you, we are none
14 2666 
14 2667    Kemp. Well, stand aside, 'fore God they are both in
14 2668 a tale: haue you writ downe that they are none?
14 2669   Sext. Master Constable, you goe not the way to examine,
14 2670 you must call forth the watch that are their accusers
14 2671 
14 2672    Kemp. Yea marry, that's the eftest way, let the watch
14 2673 come forth: masters, I charge you in the Princes name,
14 2674 accuse these men
14 2675 
14 2676    Watch 1. This man said sir, that Don Iohn the Princes
14 2677 brother was a villaine
14 2678 
14 2679    Kemp. Write down, Prince Iohn a villaine: why this
14 2680 is flat periurie, to call a Princes brother villaine
14 2681 
14 2682    Bora. Master Constable
14 2683 
14 2684    Kemp. Pray thee fellow peace, I do not like thy looke
14 2685 I promise thee
14 2686 
14 2687    Sexton. What heard you him say else?
14 2688   Watch 2. Mary that he had receiued a thousand Dukates
14 2689 of Don Iohn, for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully
14 2690 
14 2691    Kemp. Flat Burglarie as euer was committed
14 2692 
14 2693    Const. Yea by th' masse that it is
14 2694 
14 2695    Sexton. What else fellow?
14 2696   Watch 1. And that Count Claudio did meane vpon his
14 2697 words, to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly, and
14 2698 not marry her
14 2699 
14 2700    Kemp. O villaine! thou wilt be condemn'd into euerlasting
14 2701 redemption for this
14 2702 
14 2703    Sexton. What else?
14 2704   Watch. This is all
14 2705 
14 2706    Sexton. And this is more masters then you can deny,
14 2707 Prince Iohn is this morning secretly stolne away: Hero
14 2708 was in this manner accus'd, in this very manner refus'd,
14 2709 and vpon the griefe of this sodainely died: Master Constable,
14 2710 let these men be bound, and brought to Leonato,
14 2711 I will goe before, and shew him their examination
14 2712 
14 2713    Const. Come, let them be opinion'd
14 2714 
14 2715    Sex. Let them be in the hands of Coxcombe
14 2716 
14 2717    Kem. Gods my life, where's the Sexton? let him write
14 2718 downe the Princes Officer Coxcombe: come, binde them
14 2719 thou naughty varlet
14 2720 
14 2721    Couley. Away, you are an asse, you are an asse
14 2722 
14 2723    Kemp. Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
14 2724 suspect my yeeres? O that hee were heere to write mee
14 2725 downe an asse! but masters, remember that I am an asse:
14 2726 though it be not written down, yet forget not y I am an
14 2727 asse: No thou villaine, y art full of piety as shall be prou'd
14 2728 vpon thee by good witnesse, I am a wise fellow, and
14 2729 which is more, an officer, and which is more, a houshoulder,
14 2730 and which is more, as pretty a peece of flesh as any in
14 2731 Messina, and one that knowes the Law, goe to, & a rich
14 2732 fellow enough, goe to, and a fellow that hath had losses,
14 2733 and one that hath two gownes, and euery thing handsome
14 2734 about him: bring him away: O that I had been writ
14 2735 downe an asse!
14 2736 Enter.
14 2737 
14 2738 
14 2739 Actus Quintus.
14 2740 
14 2741 Enter Leonato and his brother.
14 2742 
14 2743   Brother. If you goe on thus, you will kill your selfe,
14 2744 And 'tis not wisedome thus to second griefe,
14 2745 Against your selfe
14 2746 
14 2747    Leon. I pray thee cease thy counsaile,
14 2748 Which falls into mine eares as profitlesse,
14 2749 As water in a siue: giue not me counsaile,
14 2750 Nor let no comfort delight mine eare,
14 2751 But such a one whose wrongs doth sute with mine.
14 2752 Bring me a father that so lou'd his childe,
14 2753 Whose ioy of her is ouer-whelmed like mine,
14 2754 And bid him speake of patience,
14 2755 Measure his woe the length and bredth of mine,
14 2756 And let it answere euery straine for straine,
14 2757 As thus for thus, and such a griefe for such,
14 2758 In euery lineament, branch, shape, and forme:
14 2759 If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
14 2760 And sorrow, wagge, crie hem, when he should grone,
14 2761 Patch griefe with prouerbs, make misfortune drunke,
14 2762 With candle-wasters: bring him yet to me,
14 2763 And I of him will gather patience:
14 2764 But there is no such man, for brother, men
14 2765 Can counsaile, and speake comfort to that griefe,
14 2766 Which they themselues not feele, but tasting it,
14 2767 Their counsaile turnes to passion, which before,
14 2768 Would giue preceptiall medicine to rage,
14 2769 Fetter strong madnesse in a silken thred,
14 2770 Charme ache with ayre, and agony with words,
14 2771 No, no, 'tis all mens office, to speake patience
14 2772 To those that wring vnder the load of sorrow:
14 2773 But no mans vertue nor sufficiencie
14 2774 To be so morall, when he shall endure
14 2775 The like himselfe: therefore giue me no counsaile,
14 2776 My griefs cry lowder then aduertisement
14 2777 
14 2778    Broth. Therein do men from children nothing differ
14 2779 
14 2780    Leonato. I pray thee peace, I will be flesh and bloud,
14 2781 For there was neuer yet Philosopher,
14 2782 That could endure the tooth-ake patiently,
14 2783 How euer they haue writ the stile of gods,
14 2784 And made a push at chance and sufferance
14 2785 
14 2786    Brother. Yet bend not all the harme vpon your selfe,
14 2787 Make those that doe offend you, suffer too
14 2788 
14 2789    Leon. There thou speak'st reason, nay I will doe so,
14 2790 My soule doth tell me, Hero is belied,
14 2791 And that shall Claudio know, so shall the Prince,
14 2792 And all of them that thus dishonour her.
14 2793 Enter Prince and Claudio.
14 2794 
14 2795   Brot. Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily
14 2796 
14 2797    Prin. Good den, good den
14 2798 
14 2799    Clau. Good day to both of you
14 2800 
14 2801    Leon. Heare you my Lords?
14 2802   Prin. We haue some haste Leonato
14 2803 
14 2804    Leo. Some haste my Lord! wel, fareyouwel my Lord,
14 2805 Are you so hasty now? well, all is one
14 2806 
14 2807    Prin. Nay, do not quarrel with vs, good old man
14 2808 
14 2809    Brot. If he could rite himselfe with quarrelling,
14 2810 Some of vs would lie low
14 2811 
14 2812    Claud. Who wrongs him?
14 2813   Leon. Marry y dost wrong me, thou dissembler, thou:
14 2814 Nay, neuer lay thy hand vpon thy sword,
14 2815 I feare thee not
14 2816 
14 2817    Claud. Marry beshrew my hand,
14 2818 If it should giue your age such cause of feare,
14 2819 Infaith my hand meant nothing to my sword
14 2820 
14 2821    Leonato. Tush, tush, man, neuer fleere and iest at me,
14 2822 I speake not like a dotard, nor a foole,
14 2823 As vnder priuiledge of age to bragge,
14 2824 What I haue done being yong, or what would doe,
14 2825 Were I not old, know Claudio to thy head,
14 2826 Thou hast so wrong'd my innocent childe and me,
14 2827 That I am forc'd to lay my reuerence by,
14 2828 And with grey haires and bruise of many daies,
14 2829 Doe challenge thee to triall of a man,
14 2830 I say thou hast belied mine innocent childe.
14 2831 Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
14 2832 And she lies buried with her ancestors:
14 2833 O in a tombe where neuer scandall slept,
14 2834 Saue this of hers, fram'd by thy villanie
14 2835 
14 2836    Claud. My villany?
14 2837   Leonato. Thine Claudio, thine I say
14 2838 
14 2839    Prin. You say not right old man
14 2840 
14 2841    Leon. My Lord, my Lord,
14 2842 Ile proue it on his body if he dare,
14 2843 Despight his nice fence, and his actiue practise,
14 2844 His Maie of youth, and bloome of lustihood
14 2845 
14 2846    Claud. Away, I will not haue to do with you
14 2847 
14 2848    Leo. Canst thou so daffe me? thou hast kild my child,
14 2849 If thou kilst me, boy, thou shalt kill a man
14 2850 
14 2851    Bro. He shall kill two of vs, and men indeed,
14 2852 But that's no matter, let him kill one first:
14 2853 Win me and weare me, let him answere me,
14 2854 Come follow me boy, come sir boy, come follow me
14 2855 Sir boy, ile whip you from your foyning fence,
14 2856 Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will
14 2857 
14 2858    Leon. Brother
14 2859 
14 2860    Brot. Content your self, God knows I lou'd my neece,
14 2861 And she is dead, slander'd to death by villaines,
14 2862 That dare as well answer a man indeede,
14 2863 As I dare take a serpent by the tongue.
14 2864 Boyes, apes, braggarts, Iackes, milke-sops
14 2865 
14 2866    Leon. Brother Anthony
14 2867 
14 2868    Brot. Hold you content, what man? I know them, yea
14 2869 And what they weigh, euen to the vtmost scruple,
14 2870 Scambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boyes,
14 2871 That lye, and cog, and flout, depraue, and slander,
14 2872 Goe antiquely, and show outward hidiousnesse,
14 2873 And speake of halfe a dozen dang'rous words,
14 2874 How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst.
14 2875 And this is all
14 2876 
14 2877    Leon. But brother Anthonie
14 2878 
14 2879    Ant. Come, 'tis no matter,
14 2880 Do not you meddle, let me deale in this
14 2881 
14 2882    Pri. Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience
14 2883 My heart is sorry for your daughters death:
14 2884 But on my honour she was charg'd with nothing
14 2885 But what was true, and very full of proofe
14 2886 
14 2887    Leon. My Lord, my Lord
14 2888 
14 2889    Prin. I will not heare you.
14 2890 Enter Benedicke.
14 2891 
14 2892   Leo. No come brother, away, I will be heard.
14 2893 
14 2894 Exeunt. ambo.
14 2895 
14 2896   Bro. And shall, or some of vs will smart for it
14 2897 
14 2898    Prin. See, see, here comes the man we went to seeke
14 2899 
14 2900    Clau. Now signior, what newes?
14 2901   Ben. Good day my Lord
14 2902 
14 2903    Prin. Welcome signior, you are almost come to part
14 2904 almost a fray
14 2905 
14 2906    Clau. Wee had likt to haue had our two noses snapt
14 2907 off with two old men without teeth
14 2908 
14 2909    Prin. Leonato and his brother, what think'st thou? had
14 2910 wee fought, I doubt we should haue beene too yong for
14 2911 them
14 2912 
14 2913    Ben. In a false quarrell there is no true valour, I came
14 2914 to seeke you both
14 2915 
14 2916    Clau. We haue beene vp and downe to seeke thee, for
14 2917 we are high proofe melancholly, and would faine haue it
14 2918 beaten away, wilt thou vse thy wit?
14 2919   Ben. It is in my scabberd, shall I draw it?
14 2920   Prin. Doest thou weare thy wit by thy side?
14 2921   Clau. Neuer any did so, though verie many haue been
14 2922 beside their wit, I will bid thee drawe, as we do the minstrels,
14 2923 draw to pleasure vs
14 2924 
14 2925    Prin. As I am an honest man he lookes pale, art thou
14 2926 sicke, or angrie?
14 2927   Clau. What, courage man: what though care kil'd a
14 2928 cat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care
14 2929 
14 2930    Ben. Sir, I shall meete your wit in the careere, and
14 2931 you charge it against me, I pray you chuse another subiect
14 2932 
14 2933    Clau. Nay then giue him another staffe, this last was
14 2934 broke crosse
14 2935 
14 2936    Prin. By this light, he changes more and more, I thinke
14 2937 he be angrie indeede
14 2938 
14 2939    Clau. If he be, he knowes how to turne his girdle
14 2940 
14 2941    Ben. Shall I speake a word in your eare?
14 2942   Clau. God blesse me from a challenge
14 2943 
14 2944    Ben. You are a villaine, I iest not, I will make it good
14 2945 how you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare:
14 2946 do me right, or I will protest your cowardise: you haue
14 2947 kill'd a sweete Ladie, and her death shall fall heauie on
14 2948 you, let me heare from you
14 2949 
14 2950    Clau. Well, I will meete you, so I may haue good
14 2951 cheare
14 2952 
14 2953    Prin. What, a feast, a feast?
14 2954   Clau. I faith I thanke him, he hath bid me to a calues
14 2955 head and a Capon, the which if I doe not carue most curiously,
14 2956 say my knife's naught, shall I not finde a woodcocke
14 2957 too?
14 2958   Ben. Sir, your wit ambles well, it goes easily
14 2959 
14 2960    Prin. Ile tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other
14 2961 day: I said thou hadst a fine wit: true saies she, a fine
14 2962 little one: no said I, a great wit: right saies shee, a great
14 2963 grosse one: nay said I, a good wit: iust said she, it hurts
14 2964 no body: nay said I, the gentleman is wise: certaine said
14 2965 she, a wise gentleman: nay said I, he hath the tongues:
14 2966 that I beleeue said shee, for hee swore a thing to me on
14 2967 munday night, which he forswore on tuesday morning:
14 2968 there's a double tongue, there's two tongues: thus did
14 2969 shee an howre together trans-shape thy particular vertues,
14 2970 yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the
14 2971 proprest man in Italie
14 2972 
14 2973    Claud. For the which she wept heartily, and said shee
14 2974 car'd not
14 2975 
14 2976    Prin. Yea that she did, but yet for all that, and if shee
14 2977 did not hate him deadlie, shee would loue him dearely,
14 2978 the old mans daughter told vs all
14 2979 
14 2980    Clau. All, all, and moreouer, God saw him when he
14 2981 was hid in the garden
14 2982 
14 2983    Prin. But when shall we set the sauage Bulls hornes
14 2984 on the sensible Benedicks head?
14 2985   Clau. Yea and text vnderneath, heere dwells Benedicke
14 2986 the married man
14 2987 
14 2988    Ben. Fare you well, Boy, you know my minde, I will
14 2989 leaue you now to your gossep-like humor, you breake
14 2990 iests as braggards do their blades, which God be thanked
14 2991 hurt not: my Lord, for your manie courtesies I thank
14 2992 you, I must discontinue your companie, your brother
14 2993 the Bastard is fled from Messina: you haue among you,
14 2994 kill'd a sweet and innocent Ladie: for my Lord Lackebeard
14 2995 there, he and I shall meete, and till then peace be
14 2996 with him
14 2997 
14 2998    Prin. He is in earnest
14 2999 
14 3000    Clau. In most profound earnest, and Ile warrant you,
14 3001 for the loue of Beatrice
14 3002 
14 3003    Prin. And hath challeng'd thee
14 3004 
14 3005    Clau. Most sincerely
14 3006 
14 3007    Prin. What a prettie thing man is, when he goes in his
14 3008 doublet and hose, and leaues off his wit.
14 3009 Enter Constable, Conrade, and Borachio.
14 3010 
14 3011   Clau. He is then a Giant to an Ape, but then is an Ape
14 3012 a Doctor to such a man
14 3013 
14 3014    Prin. But soft you, let me be, plucke vp my heart, and
14 3015 be sad, did he not say my brother was fled?
14 3016   Const. Come you sir, if iustice cannot tame you, shee
14 3017 shall nere weigh more reasons in her ballance, nay, and
14 3018 you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be lookt to
14 3019 
14 3020    Prin. How now, two of my brothers men bound? Borachio
14 3021 one
14 3022 
14 3023    Clau. Harken after their offence my Lord
14 3024 
14 3025    Prin. Officers, what offence haue these men done?
14 3026   Const. Marrie sir, they haue committed false report,
14 3027 moreouer they haue spoken vntruths, secondarily they
14 3028 are slanders, sixt and lastly, they haue belyed a Ladie,
14 3029 thirdly, they haue verified vniust things, and to conclude
14 3030 they are lying knaues
14 3031 
14 3032    Prin. First I aske thee what they haue done, thirdlie
14 3033 I aske thee what's their offence, sixt and lastlie why they
14 3034 are committed, and to conclude, what you lay to their
14 3035 charge
14 3036 
14 3037    Clau. Rightlie reasoned, and in his owne diuision, and
14 3038 by my troth there's one meaning well suted
14 3039 
14 3040    Prin. Who haue you offended masters, that you are
14 3041 thus bound to your answer? this learned Constable is too
14 3042 cunning to be vnderstood, what's your offence?
14 3043   Bor. Sweete Prince, let me go no farther to mine answere:
14 3044 do you heare me, and let this Count kill mee: I
14 3045 haue deceiued euen your verie eies: what your wisedomes
14 3046 could not discouer, these shallow fooles haue
14 3047 brought to light, who in the night ouerheard me confessing
14 3048 to this man, how Don Iohn your brother incensed
14 3049 me to slander the Ladie Hero, how you were brought
14 3050 into the Orchard, and saw me court Margaret in Heroes
14 3051 garments, how you disgrac'd her when you should
14 3052 marrie her: my villanie they haue vpon record, which
14 3053 I had rather seale with my death, then repeate ouer to
14 3054 my shame: the Ladie is dead vpon mine and my masters
14 3055 false accusation: and briefelie, I desire nothing but the
14 3056 reward of a villaine
14 3057 
14 3058    Prin. Runs not this speech like yron through your
14 3059 bloud?
14 3060   Clau. I haue drunke poison whiles he vtter'd it
14 3061 
14 3062    Prin. But did my Brother set thee on to this?
14 3063   Bor. Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it
14 3064 
14 3065    Prin. He is compos'd and fram'd of treacherie,
14 3066 And fled he is vpon this villanie
14 3067 
14 3068    Clau. Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appeare
14 3069 In the rare semblance that I lou'd it first
14 3070 
14 3071    Const. Come, bring away the plaintiffes, by this time
14 3072 our Sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
14 3073 and masters, do not forget to specifie when time & place
14 3074 shall serue, that I am an Asse
14 3075 
14 3076    Con.2. Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and
14 3077 the Sexton too.
14 3078 Enter Leonato.
14 3079 
14 3080   Leon. Which is the villaine? let me see his eies,
14 3081 That when I note another man like him,
14 3082 I may auoide him: which of these is he?
14 3083   Bor. If you would know your wronger, looke on me
14 3084 
14 3085    Leon. Art thou the slaue that with thy breath
14 3086 hast kild mine innocent childe?
14 3087   Bor. Yea, euen I alone
14 3088 
14 3089    Leo. No, not so villaine, thou beliest thy selfe,
14 3090 Here stand a paire of honourable men,
14 3091 A third is fled that had a hand in it:
14 3092 I thanke you Princes for my daughters death,
14 3093 Record it with your high and worthie deedes,
14 3094 'Twas brauely done, if you bethinke you of it
14 3095 
14 3096    Clau. I know not how to pray your patience,
14 3097 Yet I must speake, choose your reuenge your selfe,
14 3098 Impose me to what penance your inuention
14 3099 Can lay vpon my sinne, yet sinn'd I not,
14 3100 But in mistaking
14 3101 
14 3102    Prin. By my soule nor I,
14 3103 And yet to satisfie this good old man,
14 3104 I would bend vnder anie heauie waight,
14 3105 That heele enioyne me to
14 3106 
14 3107    Leon. I cannot bid you bid my daughter liue,
14 3108 That were impossible, but I praie you both,
14 3109 Possesse the people in Messina here,
14 3110 How innocent she died, and if your loue
14 3111 Can labour aught in sad inuention,
14 3112 Hang her an epitaph vpon her toomb,
14 3113 And sing it to her bones, sing it to night:
14 3114 To morrow morning come you to my house,
14 3115 And since you could not be my sonne in law,
14 3116 Be yet my Nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
14 3117 Almost the copie of my childe that's dead,
14 3118 And she alone is heire to both of vs,
14 3119 Giue her the right you should haue giu'n her cosin,
14 3120 And so dies my reuenge
14 3121 
14 3122    Clau. O noble sir!
14 3123 Your ouerkindnesse doth wring teares from me,
14 3124 I do embrace your offer, and dispose
14 3125 For henceforth of poore Claudio
14 3126 
14 3127    Leon. To morrow then I will expect your comming,
14 3128 To night I take my leaue, this naughtie man
14 3129 Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
14 3130 Who I beleeue was packt in all this wrong,
14 3131 Hired to it by your brother
14 3132 
14 3133    Bor. No, by my soule she was not,
14 3134 Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
14 3135 But alwaies hath bin iust and vertuous,
14 3136 In anie thing that I do know by her
14 3137 
14 3138    Const. Moreouer sir, which indeede is not vnder white
14 3139 and black, this plaintiffe here, the offendour did call mee
14 3140 asse, I beseech you let it be remembred in his punishment,
14 3141 and also the watch heard them talke of one Deformed,
14 3142 they say he weares a key in his eare and a lock hanging
14 3143 by it, and borrowes monie in Gods name, the which
14 3144 he hath vs'd so long, and neuer paied, that now men grow
14 3145 hard-harted and will lend nothing for Gods sake: praie
14 3146 you examine him vpon that point
14 3147 
14 3148    Leon. I thanke thee for thy care and honest paines
14 3149 
14 3150    Const. Your worship speakes like a most thankefull
14 3151 and reuerend youth, and I praise God for you
14 3152 
14 3153    Leon. There's for thy paines
14 3154 
14 3155    Const. God saue the foundation
14 3156 
14 3157    Leon. Goe, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I
14 3158 thanke thee
14 3159 
14 3160    Const. I leaue an arrant knaue with your worship,
14 3161 which I beseech your worship to correct your selfe, for
14 3162 the example of others: God keepe your worship, I
14 3163 wish your worship well, God restore you to health,
14 3164 I humblie giue you leaue to depart, and if a merrie
14 3165 meeting may be wisht, God prohibite it: come
14 3166 neighbour
14 3167 
14 3168    Leon. Vntill to morrow morning, Lords, farewell.
14 3169 
14 3170 Exeunt.
14 3171 
14 3172   Brot. Farewell my Lords, we looke for you to morrow
14 3173 
14 3174    Prin. We will not faile
14 3175 
14 3176    Clau. To night ile mourne with Hero
14 3177 
14 3178    Leon. Bring you these fellowes on, weel talke with
14 3179 Margaret, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd
14 3180 fellow.
14 3181 
14 3182 Exeunt.
14 3183 
14 3184 Enter Benedicke and Margaret.
14 3185 
14 3186   Ben. Praie thee sweete Mistris Margaret, deserue
14 3187 well at my hands, by helping mee to the speech of Beatrice
14 3188 
14 3189    Mar. Will you then write me a Sonnet in praise of
14 3190 my beautie?
14 3191   Bene. In so high a stile Margaret, that no man liuing
14 3192 shall come ouer it, for in most comely truth thou deseruest
14 3193 it
14 3194 
14 3195    Mar. To haue no man come ouer me, why, shall I alwaies
14 3196 keepe below staires?
14 3197   Bene. Thy wit is as quicke as the grey-hounds mouth,
14 3198 it catches
14 3199 
14 3200    Mar. And yours, as blunt as the Fencers foiles, which
14 3201 hit, but hurt not
14 3202 
14 3203    Bene. A most manly wit Margaret, it will not hurt a
14 3204 woman: and so I pray thee call Beatrice, I giue thee the
14 3205 bucklers
14 3206 
14 3207    Mar. Giue vs the swords, wee haue bucklers of our
14 3208 owne
14 3209 
14 3210    Bene. If you vse them Margaret, you must put in the
14 3211 pikes with a vice, and they are dangerous weapons for
14 3212 Maides
14 3213 
14 3214    Mar. Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I thinke
14 3215 hath legges.
14 3216 
14 3217 Exit Margarite.
14 3218 
14 3219   Ben. And therefore will come. The God of loue that
14 3220 sits aboue, and knowes me, and knowes me, how pittifull
14 3221 I deserue. I meane in singing, but in louing, Leander
14 3222 the good swimmer, Troilous the first imploier of
14 3223 pandars, and a whole booke full of these quondam carpet-mongers,
14 3224 whose name yet runne smoothly in the euen
14 3225 rode of a blanke verse, why they were neuer so truely
14 3226 turned ouer and ouer as my poore selfe in loue: marrie
14 3227 I cannot shew it rime, I haue tried, I can finde out no
14 3228 rime to Ladie but babie, an innocent rime: for scorne,
14 3229 horne, a hard rime: for schoole foole, a babling rime:
14 3230 verie ominous endings, no, I was not borne vnder a riming
14 3231 Plannet, for I cannot wooe in festiuall tearmes:
14 3232 Enter Beatrice.
14 3233 
14 3234 sweete Beatrice would'st thou come when I cal'd
14 3235 thee?
14 3236   Beat. Yea Signior, and depart when you bid me
14 3237 
14 3238    Bene. O stay but till then
14 3239 
14 3240    Beat. Then, is spoken: fare you well now, and yet ere
14 3241 I goe, let me goe with that I came, which is, with knowing
14 3242 what hath past betweene you and Claudio
14 3243 
14 3244    Bene. Onely foule words, and thereupon I will kisse
14 3245 thee
14 3246 
14 3247    Beat. Foule words is but foule wind, and foule wind
14 3248 is but foule breath, and foule breath is noisome, therefore
14 3249 I will depart vnkist
14 3250 
14 3251    Bene. Thou hast frighted the word out of his right
14 3252 sence, so forcible is thy wit, but I must tell thee plainely,
14 3253 Claudio vndergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly
14 3254 heare from him, or I will subscribe him a coward, and
14 3255 I pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst
14 3256 thou first fall in loue with me?
14 3257   Beat. For them all together, which maintain'd so
14 3258 politique a state of euill, that they will not admit any
14 3259 good part to intermingle with them: but for which of
14 3260 my good parts did you first suffer loue for me?
14 3261   Bene. Suffer loue! a good epithite, I do suffer loue indeede,
14 3262 for I loue thee against my will,
14 3263   Beat. In spight of your heart I think, alas poore heart,
14 3264 if you spight it for my sake, I will spight it for yours, for
14 3265 I will neuer loue that which my friend hates
14 3266 
14 3267    Bened. Thou and I are too wise to wooe peaceablie
14 3268 
14 3269    Bea. It appeares not in this confession, there's not one
14 3270 wise man among twentie that will praise himselfe
14 3271 
14 3272    Bene. An old, an old instance Beatrice, that liu'd in
14 3273 the time of good neighbours, if a man doe not erect in
14 3274 this age his owne tombe ere he dies, hee shall liue no
14 3275 longer in monuments, then the Bels ring, & the Widdow
14 3276 weepes
14 3277 
14 3278    Beat. And how long is that thinke you?
14 3279   Ben. Question, why an hower in clamour and a quarter
14 3280 in rhewme, therfore is it most expedient for the wise,
14 3281 if Don worme (his conscience) finde no impediment to
14 3282 the contrarie, to be the trumpet of his owne vertues, as
14 3283 I am to my selfe so much for praising my selfe, who I my
14 3284 selfe will beare witnesse is praise worthie, and now tell
14 3285 me, how doth your cosin?
14 3286   Beat. Verie ill
14 3287 
14 3288    Bene. And how doe you?
14 3289   Beat. Verie ill too.
14 3290 Enter Vrsula.
14 3291 
14 3292   Bene. Serue God, loue me, and mend, there will I leaue
14 3293 you too, for here comes one in haste

14 3395 But for my will, my will is, your good will
14 3396 May stand with ours, this day to be conioyn'd,

14 3420 And all Europa shall reioyce at thee,
14 3421 As once Europa did at lusty Ioue,

14 3440 I am your husband if you like of me

14 3443 And when you lou'd, you were my other husband
14 3444

14 3449 
14 3450    Prin. The former Hero, Hero that is dead

14 3463   Beat. Why no, no more then reason
14 3464

14 3466 haue beene deceiued, they swore you did
14 3467 
14 3468    Beat. Doe not you loue mee?

14 3481    Leon. Come Cosin, I am sure you loue the gentlema[n]
14 3482 
14 3483    Clau. And Ile be sworne vpon't, that he loues her,
14 3484 For heres a paper written in his hand,
14 3485 A halting sonnet of his owne pure braine,
14 3486 Fashioned to Beatrice
14 3487 
14 3488    Hero. And heeres another,
14 3489 Writ in my cosins hand, stolne from her pocket,
14 3490 Containing her affection vnto Benedicke
14 3491 
14 3492    Bene. A miracle, here's our owne hands against our
14 3493 hearts: come I will haue thee, but by this light I take
14 3494 thee for pittie
14 3495 
14 3496    Beat. I would not denie you, but by this good day, I
14 3497 yeeld vpon great perswasion, & partly to saue your life,
14 3498 for I was told, you were in a consumption
14 3499 
14 3500    Leon. Peace I will stop your mouth
14 3501 
14 3502    Prin. How dost thou Benedicke the married man?
14 3503   Bene. Ile tell thee what Prince: a Colledge of witte-crackers
14 3504 cannot flout mee out of my humour, dost thou
14 3505 think I care for a Satyre or an Epigram? no, if a man will
14 3506 be beaten with braines, a shall weare nothing handsome
14 3507 about him: in briefe, since I do purpose to marry, I will
14 3508 thinke nothing to any purpose that the world can say against
14 3509 it, and therefore neuer flout at me, for I haue said
14 3510 against it: for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion:
14 3511 for thy part Claudio, I did thinke to haue beaten
14 3512 thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, liue vnbruis'd,
14 3513 and loue my cousin
14 3514 
14 3515    Cla. I had well hop'd y wouldst haue denied Beatrice, y
14 3516 I might haue cudgel'd thee out of thy single life, to make
14 3517 thee a double dealer, which out of questio[n] thou wilt be,
14 3518 if my Cousin do not looke exceeding narrowly to thee
14 3519 
14 3520    Bene. Come, come, we are friends, let's haue a dance
14 3521 ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts,
14 3522 and our wiues heeles
14 3523 
14 3524    Leon. Wee'll haue dancing afterward
14 3525 
14 3526    Bene. First, of my word, therfore play musick. Prince,
14 3527 thou art sad, get thee a wife, get thee a wife, there is no
14 3528 staff more reuerend then one tipt with horn.
14 3529 Enter. Mes.
14 3530 
14 3531   Messen. My Lord, your brother Iohn is tane in flight,
14 3532 And brought with armed men backe to Messina
14 3533 
14 3534    Bene. Thinke not on him till to morrow, ile deuise
14 3535 thee braue punishments for him: strike vp Pipers.
14 3536 
14 3537 Dance.
14 3538
