11 43 SCENE:
11 44 
11 45 OLIVER'S house; FREDERICK'S court; and the Forest of Arden
11 46 
11 47 
11 48 
11 49 
11 50 ACT I. SCENE I.
11 51 
11 52 Orchard of OLIVER'S house
11 53 
11 54 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
11 55 
11 56 
11 57   ORLANDO. As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
11 58     me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
11 59     charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
11 60     begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
11 61     report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me
11 62     rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
11 63     home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
11 64     birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are
11 65     bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,
11 66     they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly
11 67     hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for
11 68     the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
11 69     as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the
11 70     something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
11 71     me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
11 72     brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
11 73     education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
11 74     my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against
11 75     this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no
11 76     wise remedy how to avoid it.
11 77 
11 78                            Enter OLIVER
11 79 
11 80 
11 81   ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.
11 82 
11 83   ORLANDO. Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
11 84     up.                                           [ADAM retires]
11 85 
11 86   OLIVER. Now, sir! what make you here?
11 87 
11 88   ORLANDO. Nothing; I am not taught to make any thing.
11 89 
11 90   OLIVER. What mar you then, sir?
11 91 
11 92   ORLANDO. Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a
11 93     poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
11 94 
11 95   OLIVER. Marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.
11 96 
11 97   ORLANDO. Shall I keep your hogs, and eat husks with them? What
11 98     prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury?
11 99 
11 100   OLIVER. Know you where you are, sir?
11 101 
11 102   ORLANDO. O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
11 103 
11 104   OLIVER. Know you before whom, sir?
11 105 
11 106   ORLANDO. Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are
11 107     my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you
11 108     should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better
11 109     in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not
11 110     away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as
11 111     much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming
11 112     before me is nearer to his reverence.
11 113 
11 114   OLIVER. What, boy!                               [Strikes him]
11 115 
11 116   ORLANDO. Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
11 117 
11 118   OLIVER. Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
11 119 
11 120   ORLANDO. I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
11 121     Boys. He was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
11 122     a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not
11 123     take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
11 124     tongue for saying so. Thou has rail'd on thyself.
11 125 
11 126   ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
11 127     remembrance, be at accord.
11 128 
11 129   OLIVER. Let me go, I say.
11 130 
11 131   ORLANDO. I will not, till I please; you shall hear me. My father
11 132     charg'd you in his will to give me good education: you have
11 133     train'd me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all
11 134     gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
11 135     me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such
11 136     exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor
11 137     allottery my father left me by testament; with that I will go buy
11 138     my fortunes.
11 139 
11 140   OLIVER. And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir,
11 141     get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have
11 142     some part of your will. I pray you leave me.
11 143 
11 144   ORLANDO. I no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
11 145 
11 146   OLIVER. Get you with him, you old dog.
11 147 
11 148   ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
11 149     your service. God be with my old master! He would not have spoke
11 150     such a word.
11 151                                          Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
11 152 
11 153   OLIVER. Is it even so? Begin you to grow upon me? I will physic
11 154     your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither.
11 155     Holla, Dennis!
11 156 
11 157                           Enter DENNIS
11 158 
11 159 
11 160   DENNIS. Calls your worship?
11 161 
11 162   OLIVER. not Charles, the Duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
11 163 
11 164   DENNIS. So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access
11 165     to you.
11 166 
11 167   OLIVER. Call him in. [Exit DENNIS] 'Twill be a good way; and
11 168     to-morrow the wrestling is.
11 169 
11 170                           Enter CHARLES
11 171 
11 172 
11 173   CHARLES. Good morrow to your worship.
11 174 
11 175   OLIVER. Good Monsieur Charles! What's the new news at the new
11 176     court?
11 177 
11 178   CHARLES. There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
11 179     is, the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke;
11 180     and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
11 181     exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke;
11 182     therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
11 183 
11 184   OLIVER. Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke's daughter, be banished
11 185     with her father?
11 186 
11 187   CHARLES. O, no; for the Duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
11 188     being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have
11 189     followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at
11 190     the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
11 191     daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.
11 192 
11 193   OLIVER. Where will the old Duke live?
11 194 
11 195   CHARLES. They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many
11 196     merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood
11 197     of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,
11 198     and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
11 199 
11 200   OLIVER. What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new Duke?
11 201 
11 202   CHARLES. Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
11 203     matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
11 204     brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
11 205     me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he
11 206     that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
11 207     Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would
11 208     be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come
11 209     in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint
11 210     you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,
11 211     or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is
11 212     thing of his own search and altogether against my will.
11 213 
11 214   OLIVER. Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt
11 215     find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my
11 216     brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to
11 217     dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,
11 218     Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of
11 219     ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret
11 220     and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
11 221     Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his
11 222     neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou
11 223     dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace
11 224     himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap
11 225     thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he
11 226     hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I
11 227     assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one
11 228     so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly
11 229     of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush
11 230     and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.
11 231 
11 232   CHARLES. I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
11 233     to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,
11 234     I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!
11 235 
11 236  Exit
11 237 
11 238   OLIVER. Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester.
11 239     I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
11 240     hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and
11 241     yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
11 242     beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and
11 243     especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am
11 244     altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler
11 245     shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy
11 246     thither, which now I'll go about.                       Exit

11 258 
11 259 SCENE II.
11 260 
11 261 A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
11 262 
11 263 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
11 264 
11 265 
11 266   CELIA. I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
11 267 
11 268   ROSALIND. Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; and
11 269     would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget
11 270     a banished father, you must not learn me how to remember any
11 271     extraordinary pleasure.
11 272 
11 273   CELIA. Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I
11 274     love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, had banished thy
11 275     uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me,
11 276     I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst
11 277     thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd
11 278     as mine is to thee.
11 279 
11 280   ROSALIND. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
11 281     rejoice in yours.
11 282 
11 283   CELIA. You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to
11 284     have; and, truly, when he dies thou shalt be his heir; for what
11 285     he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee
11 286     again in affection. By mine honour, I will; and when I break that
11 287     oath, let me turn monster; therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear
11 288     Rose, be merry.
11 289 
11 290   ROSALIND. From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
11 291     Let me see; what think you of falling in love?
11 292 
11 293   CELIA. Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal; but love no man
11 294     in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither than with safety
11 295     of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again.
11 296 
11 297   ROSALIND. What shall be our sport, then?
11 298 
11 299   CELIA. Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
11 300     wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
11 301 
11 302   ROSALIND. I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
11 303     misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
11 304     gifts to women.
11 305 
11 306   CELIA. 'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
11 307     honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
11 308     ill-favouredly.
11 309 
11 310   ROSALIND. Nay; now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's:
11 311     Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
11 312     Nature.
11 313 
11 314                          Enter TOUCHSTONE
11 315 
11 316 
11 317   CELIA. No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
11 318     Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to
11 319     flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
11 320     the argument?
11 321 
11 322   ROSALIND. Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
11 323     Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of Nature's wit.
11 324 
11 325   CELIA. Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
11 326     Nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of
11 327     such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
11 328     always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.
11 329     How now, wit! Whither wander you?
11 330 
11 331   TOUCHSTONE. Mistress, you must come away to your father.
11 332 
11 333   CELIA. Were you made the messenger?
11 334 
11 335   TOUCHSTONE. No, by mine honour; but I was bid to come for you.
11 336 
11 337   ROSALIND. Where learned you that oath, fool?
11 338 
11 339   TOUCHSTONE. Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
11 340     good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.
11 341     Now I'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard
11 342     was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.
11 343 
11 344   CELIA. How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?
11 345 
11 346   ROSALIND. Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
11 347 
11 348   TOUCHSTONE. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
11 349     by your beards that I am a knave.
11 350 
11 351   CELIA. By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
11 352 
11 353   TOUCHSTONE. By my knavery, if I had it, then I were. But if you
11 354     swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
11 355     knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he
11 356     had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
11 357     that mustard.
11 358 
11 359   CELIA. Prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?
11 360 
11 361   TOUCHSTONE. One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
11 362 
11 363   CELIA. My father's love is enough to honour him. Enough, speak no
11 364     more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.
11 365 
11 366   TOUCHSTONE. The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
11 367     men do foolishly.
11 368 
11 369   CELIA. By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
11 370     fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
11 371     makes a great show. Here comes Monsieur Le Beau.
11 372 
11 373                            Enter LE BEAU
11 374 
11 375 
11 376   ROSALIND. With his mouth full of news.
11 377 
11 378   CELIA. Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.
11 379 
11 380   ROSALIND. Then shall we be news-cramm'd.
11 381 
11 382   CELIA. All the better; we shall be the more marketable. Bon jour,
11 383     Monsieur Le Beau. What's the news?
11 384 
11 385   LE BEAU. Fair Princess, you have lost much good sport.
11 386 
11 387   CELIA. Sport! of what colour?
11 388 
11 389   LE BEAU. What colour, madam? How shall I answer you?
11 390 
11 391   ROSALIND. As wit and fortune will.
11 392 
11 393   TOUCHSTONE. Or as the Destinies decrees.
11 394 
11 395   CELIA. Well said; that was laid on with a trowel.
11 396 
11 397   TOUCHSTONE. Nay, if I keep not my rank-
11 398 
11 399   ROSALIND. Thou losest thy old smell.
11 400 
11 401   LE BEAU. You amaze me, ladies. I would have told you of good
11 402     wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
11 403 
11 404   ROSALIND. Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.
11 405 
11 406   LE BEAU. I will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
11 407     ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and
11 408     here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.
11 409 
11 410   CELIA. Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
11 411 
11 412   LE BEAU. There comes an old man and his three sons-
11 413 
11 414   CELIA. I could match this beginning with an old tale.
11 415 
11 416   LE BEAU. Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
11 417 
11 418   ROSALIND. With bills on their necks: 'Be it known unto all men by
11 419     these presents'-
11 420 
11 421   LE BEAU. The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke's
11 422     wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
11 423     his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv'd
11 424     the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
11 425     their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the
11 426     beholders take his part with weeping.
11 427 
11 428   ROSALIND. Alas!
11 429 
11 430   TOUCHSTONE. But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
11 431     lost?
11 432 
11 433   LE BEAU. Why, this that I speak of.
11 434 
11 435   TOUCHSTONE. Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time
11 436     that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.
11 437 
11 438   CELIA. Or I, I promise thee.
11 439 
11 440   ROSALIND. But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
11 441     his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?
11 442     Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
11 443 
11 444   LE BEAU. You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
11 445     appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.
11 446 
11 447   CELIA. Yonder, sure, they are coming. Let us now stay and see it.
11 448 
11 449            Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, LORDS, ORLANDO,
11 450                      CHARLES, and ATTENDANTS
11 451 
11 452 
11 453   FREDERICK. Come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own
11 454     peril on his forwardness.
11 455 
11 456   ROSALIND. Is yonder the man?
11 457 
11 458   LE BEAU. Even he, madam.
11 459 
11 460   CELIA. Alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.
11 461 
11 462   FREDERICK. How now, daughter and cousin! Are you crept hither to
11 463     see the wrestling?
11 464 
11 465   ROSALIND. Ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.
11 466 
11 467   FREDERICK. You will take little delight in it, I can tell you,
11 468 
11 469     there is such odds in the man. In pity of the challenger's youth
11 470     I would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.
11 471     Speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.
11 472 
11 473   CELIA. Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
11 474 
11 475   FREDERICK. Do so; I'll not be by.
11 476                                      [DUKE FREDERICK goes apart]
11 477 
11 478   LE BEAU. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princess calls for you.
11 479 
11 480   ORLANDO. I attend them with all respect and duty.
11 481 
11 482   ROSALIND. Young man, have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler?
11 483 
11 484   ORLANDO. No, fair Princess; he is the general challenger. I come
11 485     but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.
11 486 
11 487   CELIA. Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
11 488     You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw
11 489     yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the
11 490     fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
11 491     enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own
11 492     safety and give over this attempt.
11 493 
11 494   ROSALIND. Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be
11 495     misprised: we will make it our suit to the Duke that the
11 496     wrestling might not go forward.
11 497 
11 498   ORLANDO. I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,
11 499     wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent
11 500     ladies any thing. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
11 501     with me to my trial; wherein if I be foil'd there is but one
11 502     sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is
11 503     willing to be so. I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none
11 504     to lament me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only
11 505     in the world I fill up a place, which may be better supplied when
11 506     I have made it empty.
11 507 
11 508   ROSALIND. The little strength that I have, I would it were with
11 509     you.
11 510 
11 511   CELIA. And mine to eke out hers.
11 512 
11 513   ROSALIND. Fare you well. Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you!
11 514 
11 515   CELIA. Your heart's desires be with you!
11 516 
11 517   CHARLES. Come, where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
11 518     lie with his mother earth?
11 519 
11 520   ORLANDO. Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
11 521 
11 522   FREDERICK. You shall try but one fall.
11 523 
11 524   CHARLES. No, I warrant your Grace, you shall not entreat him to a
11 525     second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.
11 526 
11 527   ORLANDO. You mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me
11 528     before; but come your ways.
11 529 
11 530   ROSALIND. Now, Hercules be thy speed, young man!
11 531 
11 532   CELIA. I would I were invisible, to catch the strong fellow by the
11 533     leg.                                          [They wrestle]
11 534 
11 535   ROSALIND. O excellent young man!
11 536 
11 537   CELIA. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who should
11 538     down.
11 539                                       [CHARLES is thrown. Shout]
11 540 
11 541   FREDERICK. No more, no more.
11 542 
11 543   ORLANDO. Yes, I beseech your Grace; I am not yet well breath'd.
11 544 
11 545   FREDERICK. How dost thou, Charles?
11 546 
11 547   LE BEAU. He cannot speak, my lord.
11 548 
11 549   FREDERICK. Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
11 550 
11 551   ORLANDO. Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
11 552     Boys.
11 553 
11 554   FREDERICK. I would thou hadst been son to some man else.
11 555     The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
11 556     But I did find him still mine enemy.
11 557     Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed,
11 558     Hadst thou descended from another house.
11 559     But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth;
11 560     I would thou hadst told me of another father.
11 561                                  Exeunt DUKE, train, and LE BEAU
11 562 
11 563   CELIA. Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
11 564 
11 565   ORLANDO. I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
11 566     His youngest son- and would not change that calling
11 567     To be adopted heir to Frederick.
11 568 
11 569   ROSALIND. My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul,
11 570     And all the world was of my father's mind;
11 571     Had I before known this young man his son,
11 572     I should have given him tears unto entreaties
11 573     Ere he should thus have ventur'd.
11 574 
11 575   CELIA. Gentle cousin,
11 576     Let us go thank him, and encourage him;
11 577     My father's rough and envious disposition
11 578     Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserv'd;
11 579     If you do keep your promises in love
11 580     But justly as you have exceeded all promise,
11 581     Your mistress shall be happy.
11 582 
11 583   ROSALIND. Gentleman,        [Giving him a chain from her neck]
11 584     Wear this for me; one out of suits with fortune,
11 585     That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
11 586     Shall we go, coz?
11 587 
11 588   CELIA. Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
11 589 
11 590   ORLANDO. Can I not say 'I thank you'? My better parts
11 591     Are all thrown down; and that which here stands up
11 592     Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
11 593 
11 594   ROSALIND. He calls us back. My pride fell with my fortunes;
11 595     I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
11 596     Sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown
11 597     More than your enemies.
11 598 
11 599   CELIA. Will you go, coz?
11 600 
11 601   ROSALIND. Have with you. Fare you well.
11 602                                        Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
11 603 
11 604   ORLANDO. What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
11 605     I cannot speak to her, yet she urg'd conference.
11 606     O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
11 607     Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
11 608 
11 609                       Re-enter LE BEAU
11 610 
11 611 
11 612   LE BEAU. Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
11 613     To leave this place. Albeit you have deserv'd
11 614     High commendation, true applause, and love,
11 615     Yet such is now the Duke's condition
11 616     That he misconstrues all that you have done.
11 617     The Duke is humorous; what he is, indeed,
11 618     More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
11 619 
11 620   ORLANDO. I thank you, sir; and pray you tell me this:
11 621     Which of the two was daughter of the Duke
11 622     That here was at the wrestling?
11 623 
11 624   LE BEAU. Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
11 625     But yet, indeed, the smaller is his daughter;
11 626     The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,
11 627     And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
11 628     To keep his daughter company; whose loves
11 629     Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
11 630     But I can tell you that of late this Duke
11 631     Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
11 632     Grounded upon no other argument
11 633     But that the people praise her for her virtues
11 634     And pity her for her good father's sake;
11 635     And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
11 636     Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well.
11 637     Hereafter, in a better world than this,
11 638     I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
11 639 
11 640   ORLANDO. I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.
11 641                                                     Exit LE BEAU
11 642     Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
11 643     From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother.
11 644     But heavenly Rosalind!                                  Exit
11 645 
11 646 
11 647 SCENE III.
11 648 
11 649 The DUKE's palace
11 650 
11 651 Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
11 652 
11 653 
11 654   CELIA. Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy!
11 655     Not a word?
11 656 
11 657   ROSALIND. Not one to throw at a dog.
11 658 
11 659   CELIA. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs;
11 660     throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
11 661 
11 662   ROSALIND. Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should
11 663     be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any.
11 664 
11 665   CELIA. But is all this for your father?
11 666 
11 667   ROSALIND. No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how full of
11 668     briers is this working-day world!
11 669 
11 670   CELIA. They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday
11 671     foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats
11 672     will catch them.
11 673 
11 674   ROSALIND. I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my
11 675     heart.
11 676 
11 677   CELIA. Hem them away.
11 678 
11 679   ROSALIND. I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
11 680 
11 681   CELIA. Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
11 682 
11 683   ROSALIND. O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.
11 684 
11 685   CELIA. O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of
11 686     a fall. But, turning these jests out of service, let us talk in
11 687     good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall
11 688     into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
11 689 
11 690   ROSALIND. The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly.
11 691 
11 692   CELIA. Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
11 693     By this kind of chase I should hate him, for my father hated his
11 694     father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.
11 695 
11 696   ROSALIND. No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
11 697 
11 698   CELIA. Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?
11 699 
11 700                     Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
11 701 
11 702 
11 703   ROSALIND. Let me love him for that; and do you love him because I
11 704     do. Look, here comes the Duke.
11 705 
11 706   CELIA. With his eyes full of anger.
11 707 
11 708   FREDERICK. Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
11 709     And get you from our court.
11 710 
11 711   ROSALIND. Me, uncle?
11 712 
11 713   FREDERICK. You, cousin.
11 714     Within these ten days if that thou beest found
11 715     So near our public court as twenty miles,
11 716     Thou diest for it.
11 717 
11 718   ROSALIND. I do beseech your Grace,
11 719     Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me.
11 720     If with myself I hold intelligence,
11 721     Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;
11 722     If that I do not dream, or be not frantic-
11 723     As I do trust I am not- then, dear uncle,
11 724     Never so much as in a thought unborn
11 725     Did I offend your Highness.
11 726 
11 727   FREDERICK. Thus do all traitors;
11 728     If their purgation did consist in words,
11 729     They are as innocent as grace itself.
11 730     Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
11 731 
11 732   ROSALIND. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
11 733     Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
11 734 
11 735   FREDERICK. Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
11 736 
11 737   ROSALIND. SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom;
11 738     So was I when your Highness banish'd him.
11 739     Treason is not inherited, my lord;
11 740     Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
11 741     What's that to me? My father was no traitor.
11 742     Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
11 743     To think my poverty is treacherous.
11 744 
11 745   CELIA. Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
11 746 
11 747   FREDERICK. Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
11 748     Else had she with her father rang'd along.
11 749 
11 750   CELIA. I did not then entreat to have her stay;
11 751     It was your pleasure, and your own remorse;
11 752     I was too young that time to value her,
11 753     But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
11 754     Why so am I: we still have slept together,
11 755     Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together;
11 756     And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
11 757     Still we went coupled and inseparable.
11 758 
11 759   FREDERICK. She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
11 760     Her very silence and her patience,
11 761     Speak to the people, and they pity her.
11 762     Thou art a fool. She robs thee of thy name;
11 763     And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
11 764     When she is gone. Then open not thy lips.
11 765     Firm and irrevocable is my doom
11 766     Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
11 767 
11 768   CELIA. Pronounce that sentence, then, on me, my liege;
11 769     I cannot live out of her company.
11 770 
11 771   FREDERICK. You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself.
11 772     If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
11 773     And in the greatness of my word, you die.
11 774                                            Exeunt DUKE and LORDS
11 775 
11 776   CELIA. O my poor Rosalind! Whither wilt thou go?
11 777     Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
11 778     I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am.
11 779 
11 780   ROSALIND. I have more cause.
11 781 
11 782   CELIA. Thou hast not, cousin.
11 783     Prithee be cheerful. Know'st thou not the Duke
11 784     Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
11 785 
11 786   ROSALIND. That he hath not.
11 787 
11 788   CELIA. No, hath not? Rosalind lacks, then, the love
11 789     Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
11 790     Shall we be sund'red? Shall we part, sweet girl?
11 791     No; let my father seek another heir.
11 792     Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
11 793     Whither to go, and what to bear with us;
11 794     And do not seek to take your charge upon you,
11 795     To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;
11 796     For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
11 797     Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
11 798 
11 799   ROSALIND. Why, whither shall we go?
11 800 
11 801   CELIA. To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden.
11 802 
11 803   ROSALIND. Alas, what danger will it be to us,
11 804     Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
11 805     Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
11 806 
11 807   CELIA. I'll put myself in poor and mean attire,
11 808     And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
11 809     The like do you; so shall we pass along,
11 810     And never stir assailants.
11 811 
11 812   ROSALIND. Were it not better,
11 813     Because that I am more than common tall,
11 814     That I did suit me all points like a man?
11 815     A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
11 816     A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
11 817     Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will-
11 818     We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
11 819     As many other mannish cowards have
11 820     That do outface it with their semblances.
11 821 
11 822   CELIA. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
11 823 
11 824   ROSALIND. I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,
11 825     And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
11 826     But what will you be call'd?
11 827 
11 828   CELIA. Something that hath a reference to my state:
11 829     No longer Celia, but Aliena.
11 830 
11 831   ROSALIND. But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
11 832     The clownish fool out of your father's court?
11 833     Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
11 834 
11 835   CELIA. He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
11 836     Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
11 837     And get our jewels and our wealth together;
11 838     Devise the fittest time and safest way
11 839     To hide us from pursuit that will be made
11 840     After my flight. Now go we in content
11 841     To liberty, and not to banishment.                    Exeunt

11 856 ACT II. SCENE I.
11 857 
11 858 The Forest of Arden
11 859 
11 860 Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three LORDS, like foresters
11 861 
11 862 
11 863   DUKE SENIOR. Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
11 864     Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
11 865     Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
11 866     More free from peril than the envious court?
11 867     Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
11 868     The seasons' difference; as the icy fang
11 869     And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
11 870     Which when it bites and blows upon my body,
11 871     Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
11 872     'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
11 873     That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
11 874     Sweet are the uses of adversity,
11 875     Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
11 876     Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
11 877     And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
11 878     Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
11 879     Sermons in stones, and good in everything.
11 880     I would not change it.
11 881 
11 882   AMIENS. Happy is your Grace,
11 883     That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
11 884     Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
11 885 
11 886   DUKE SENIOR. Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
11 887     And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
11 888     Being native burghers of this desert city,
11 889     Should, in their own confines, with forked heads
11 890     Have their round haunches gor'd.
11 891 
11 892   FIRST LORD. Indeed, my lord,
11 893     The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;
11 894     And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
11 895     Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
11 896     To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
11 897     Did steal behind him as he lay along
11 898     Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
11 899     Upon the brook that brawls along this wood!
11 900     To the which place a poor sequest'red stag,
11 901     That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
11 902     Did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
11 903     The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
11 904     That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
11 905     Almost to bursting; and the big round tears
11 906     Cours'd one another down his innocent nose
11 907     In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
11 908     Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
11 909     Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
11 910     Augmenting it with tears.
11 911 
11 912   DUKE SENIOR. But what said Jaques?
11 913     Did he not moralize this spectacle?
11 914 
11 915   FIRST LORD. O, yes, into a thousand similes.
11 916     First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
11 917     'Poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
11 918     As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
11 919     To that which had too much.' Then, being there alone,
11 920     Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
11 921     ''Tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part
11 922     The flux of company.' Anon, a careless herd,
11 923     Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
11 924     And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques
11 925     'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
11 926     'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
11 927     Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
11 928     Thus most invectively he pierceth through
11 929     The body of the country, city, court,
11 930     Yea, and of this our life; swearing that we
11 931     Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
11 932     To fright the animals, and to kill them up
11 933     In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
11 934 
11 935   DUKE SENIOR. And did you leave him in this contemplation?
11 936 
11 937   SECOND LORD. We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
11 938     Upon the sobbing deer.
11 939 
11 940   DUKE SENIOR. Show me the place;
11 941     I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
11 942     For then he's full of matter.
11 943 
11 944   FIRST LORD. I'll bring you to him straight.             Exeunt
11 945 
11 946 
11 947 SCENE II.
11 948 
11 949 The DUKE'S palace
11 950 
11 951 Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with LORDS
11 952 
11 953 
11 954   FREDERICK. Can it be possible that no man saw them?
11 955     It cannot be; some villains of my court
11 956     Are of consent and sufferance in this.
11 957 
11 958   FIRST LORD. I cannot hear of any that did see her.
11 959     The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
11 960     Saw her abed, and in the morning early
11 961     They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress.
11 962 
11 963   SECOND LORD. My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
11 964     Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
11 965     Hisperia, the Princess' gentlewoman,
11 966     Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
11 967     Your daughter and her cousin much commend
11 968     The parts and graces of the wrestler
11 969     That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
11 970     And she believes, wherever they are gone,
11 971     That youth is surely in their company.
11 972 
11 973   FREDERICK. Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.
11 974     If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
11 975     I'll make him find him. Do this suddenly;
11 976     And let not search and inquisition quail
11 977     To bring again these foolish runaways.                Exeunt
11 978 
11 979 
11 980 SCENE III.
11 981 
11 982 Before OLIVER'S house
11 983 
11 984 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting
11 985 
11 986 
11 987   ORLANDO. Who's there?
11 988 
11 989   ADAM. What, my young master? O my gentle master!
11 990     O my sweet master! O you memory
11 991     Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
11 992     Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
11 993     And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
11 994     Why would you be so fond to overcome
11 995     The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke?
11 996     Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
11 997     Know you not, master, to some kind of men
11 998     Their graces serve them but as enemies?
11 999     No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
11 1000     Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
11 1001     O, what a world is this, when what is comely
11 1002     Envenoms him that bears it!
11 1003 
11 1004   ORLANDO. Why, what's the matter?
11 1005 
11 1006   ADAM. O unhappy youth!
11 1007     Come not within these doors; within this roof
11 1008     The enemy of all your graces lives.
11 1009     Your brother- no, no brother; yet the son-
11 1010     Yet not the son; I will not call him son
11 1011     Of him I was about to call his father-
11 1012     Hath heard your praises; and this night he means
11 1013     To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
11 1014     And you within it. If he fail of that,
11 1015     He will have other means to cut you off;
11 1016     I overheard him and his practices.
11 1017     This is no place; this house is but a butchery;
11 1018     Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
11 1019 
11 1020   ORLANDO. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
11 1021 
11 1022   ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.
11 1023 
11 1024   ORLANDO. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food,
11 1025     Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce
11 1026     A thievish living on the common road?
11 1027     This I must do, or know not what to do;
11 1028     Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
11 1029     I rather will subject me to the malice
11 1030     Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
11 1031 
11 1032   ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
11 1033     The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father,
11 1034     Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,
11 1035     When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
11 1036     And unregarded age in corners thrown.
11 1037     Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
11 1038     Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
11 1039     Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
11 1040     All this I give you. Let me be your servant;
11 1041     Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
11 1042     For in my youth I never did apply
11 1043     Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
11 1044     Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
11 1045     The means of weakness and debility;
11 1046     Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
11 1047     Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you;
11 1048     I'll do the service of a younger man
11 1049     In all your business and necessities.
11 1050 
11 1051   ORLANDO. O good old man, how well in thee appears
11 1052     The constant service of the antique world,
11 1053     When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
11 1054     Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
11 1055     Where none will sweat but for promotion,
11 1056     And having that do choke their service up
11 1057     Even with the having; it is not so with thee.
11 1058     But, poor old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree
11 1059     That cannot so much as a blossom yield
11 1060     In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
11 1061     But come thy ways, we'll go along together,
11 1062     And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
11 1063     We'll light upon some settled low content.
11 1064 
11 1065   ADAM. Master, go on; and I will follow the
11 1066     To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
11 1067     From seventeen years till now almost four-score
11 1068     Here lived I, but now live here no more.
11 1069     At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
11 1070     But at fourscore it is too late a week;
11 1071     Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
11 1072     Than to die well and not my master's debtor.          Exeunt
11 1073 
11 1074 
11 1075 SCENE IV.
11 1076 
11 1077 The Forest of Arden
11 1078 
11 1079 Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE, CELIA for ALIENA, and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE
11 1080 
11 1081 
11 1082   ROSALIND. O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
11 1083 
11 1084   TOUCHSTONE. I Care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
11 1085 
11 1086   ROSALIND. I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's apparel,
11 1087     and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as
11 1088     doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat;
11 1089     therefore, courage, good Aliena.
11 1090 
11 1091   CELIA. I pray you bear with me; I cannot go no further.
11 1092 
11 1093   TOUCHSTONE. For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you;
11 1094     yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you; for I think you
11 1095     have no money in your purse.
11 1096 
11 1097   ROSALIND. Well,. this is the Forest of Arden.
11 1098 
11 1099   TOUCHSTONE. Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was at
11 1100     home I was in a better place; but travellers must be content.
11 1101 
11 1102                         Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
11 1103 
11 1104 
11 1105   ROSALIND. Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a
11 1106     young man and an old in solemn talk.
11 1107 
11 1108   CORIN. That is the way to make her scorn you still.
11 1109 
11 1110   SILVIUS. O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
11 1111 
11 1112   CORIN. I partly guess; for I have lov'd ere now.
11 1113 
11 1114   SILVIUS. No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
11 1115     Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
11 1116     As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.
11 1117     But if thy love were ever like to mine,
11 1118     As sure I think did never man love so,
11 1119     How many actions most ridiculous
11 1120     Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
11 1121 
11 1122   CORIN. Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
11 1123 
11 1124   SILVIUS. O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
11 1125     If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
11 1126     That ever love did make thee run into,
11 1127     Thou hast not lov'd;
11 1128     Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
11 1129     Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
11 1130     Thou hast not lov'd;
11 1131     Or if thou hast not broke from company
11 1132     Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
11 1133     Thou hast not lov'd.
11 1134     O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!                          Exit Silvius
11 1135 
11 1136   ROSALIND. Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
11 1137     I have by hard adventure found mine own.
11 1138 
11 1139   TOUCHSTONE. And I mine. I remember, when I was in love, I broke my
11 1140     sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to
11 1141     Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the
11 1142     cow's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember
11 1143     the wooing of peascod instead of her; from whom I took two cods,
11 1144     and giving her them again, said with weeping tears 'Wear these
11 1145     for my sake.' We that are true lovers run into strange capers;
11 1146     but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal
11 1147     in folly.
11 1148 
11 1149   ROSALIND. Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of.
11 1150 
11 1151   TOUCHSTONE. Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break
11 1152     my shins against it.
11 1153 
11 1154   ROSALIND. Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
11 1155     Is much upon my fashion.
11 1156 
11 1157   TOUCHSTONE. And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
11 1158 
11 1159   CELIA. I pray you, one of you question yond man
11 1160     If he for gold will give us any food;
11 1161     I faint almost to death.
11 1162 
11 1163   TOUCHSTONE. Holla, you clown!
11 1164 
11 1165   ROSALIND. Peace, fool; he's not thy Ensman.
11 1166 
11 1167   CORIN. Who calls?
11 1168 
11 1169   TOUCHSTONE. Your betters, sir.
11 1170 
11 1171   CORIN. Else are they very wretched.
11 1172 
11 1173   ROSALIND. Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
11 1174 
11 1175   CORIN. And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
11 1176 
11 1177   ROSALIND. I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
11 1178     Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
11 1179     Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
11 1180     Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,
11 1181     And faints for succour.
11 1182 
11 1183   CORIN. Fair sir, I pity her,
11 1184     And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
11 1185     My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
11 1186     But I am shepherd to another man,
11 1187     And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
11 1188     My master is of churlish disposition,
11 1189     And little recks to find the way to heaven
11 1190     By doing deeds of hospitality.
11 1191     Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,
11 1192     Are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,
11 1193     By reason of his absence, there is nothing
11 1194     That you will feed on; but what is, come see,
11 1195     And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
11 1196 
11 1197   ROSALIND. What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
11 1198 
11 1199   CORIN. That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
11 1200     That little cares for buying any thing.
11 1201 
11 1202   ROSALIND. I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
11 1203     Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
11 1204     And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
11 1205 
11 1206   CELIA. And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
11 1207     And willingly could waste my time in it.
11 1208 
11 1209   CORIN. Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
11 1210     Go with me; if you like upon report
11 1211     The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
11 1212     I will your very faithful feeder be,
11 1213     And buy it with your gold right suddenly.             Exeunt
11 1214 
11 1215 
11 1216 SCENE V.
11 1217 
11 1218 Another part of the forest
11 1219 
11 1220 Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and OTHERS
11 1221 
11 1222                        SONG
11 1223 
11 1224   AMIENS.    Under the greenwood tree
11 1225                Who loves to lie with me,
11 1226                And turn his merry note
11 1227                Unto the sweet bird's throat,
11 1228              Come hither, come hither, come hither.
11 1229                Here shall he see
11 1230                No enemy
11 1231              But winter and rough weather.
11 1232 
11 1233 
11 1234   JAQUES. More, more, I prithee, more.
11 1235 
11 1236   AMIENS. It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
11 1237 
11 1238   JAQUES. I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck melancholy
11 1239     out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee, more.
11 1240 
11 1241   AMIENS. My voice is ragged; I know I cannot please you.
11 1242 
11 1243   JAQUES. I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to sing.
11 1244     Come, more; another stanzo. Call you 'em stanzos?
11 1245 
11 1246   AMIENS. What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
11 1247 
11 1248   JAQUES. Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me nothing.
11 1249     Will you sing?
11 1250 
11 1251   AMIENS. More at your request than to please myself.
11 1252 
11 1253   JAQUES. Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you; but
11 1254     that they call compliment is like th' encounter of two dog-apes;
11 1255     and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks have given him a
11 1256     penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you
11 1257     that will not, hold your tongues.
11 1258 
11 1259   AMIENS. Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke
11 1260     will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look
11 1261     you.
11 1262 
11 1263   JAQUES. And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is to
11 1264     disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he; but
11 1265     I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. Come, warble,
11 1266     come.
11 1267 
11 1268                        SONG
11 1269               [All together here]
11 1270 
11 1271            Who doth ambition shun,
11 1272            And loves to live i' th' sun,
11 1273            Seeking the food he eats,
11 1274            And pleas'd with what he gets,
11 1275          Come hither, come hither, come hither.
11 1276            Here shall he see
11 1277            No enemy
11 1278            But winter and rough weather.
11 1279 
11 1280 
11 1281   JAQUES. I'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in
11 1282     despite of my invention.
11 1283 
11 1284   AMIENS. And I'll sing it.
11 1285 
11 1286   JAQUES. Thus it goes:
11 1287 
11 1288              If it do come to pass
11 1289              That any man turn ass,
11 1290              Leaving his wealth and ease
11 1291              A stubborn will to please,
11 1292            Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame;
11 1293              Here shall he see
11 1294              Gross fools as he,
11 1295              An if he will come to me.
11 1296 
11 1297 
11 1298   AMIENS. What's that 'ducdame'?
11 1299 
11 1300   JAQUES. 'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle.
11 1301     I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll rail against all the
11 1302     first-born of Egypt.
11 1303 
11 1304   AMIENS. And I'll go seek the Duke; his banquet is prepar'd.
11 1305                                                 Exeunt severally
11 1306 
11 1307 
11 1308 SCENE VI.
11 1309 
11 1310 The forest
11 1311 
11 1312 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
11 1313 
11 1314 
11 1315   ADAM. Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie
11 1316     I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
11 1317 
11 1318   ORLANDO. Why, how now, Adam! No greater heart in thee? Live a
11 1319     little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth
11 1320     forest yield anything savage, I will either be food for it or
11 1321     bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
11 1322     powers. For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at the
11 1323     arm's end. I will here be with the presently; and if I bring thee
11 1324     not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou
11 1325     diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
11 1326     thou look'st cheerly; and I'll be with thee quickly. Yet thou
11 1327     liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter;
11 1328     and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner, if there live
11 1329     anything in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam!          Exeunt
11 1330 
11 1331 
11 1332 SCENE VII.
11 1333 
11 1334 The forest
11 1335 
11 1336 A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
11 1337 
11 1338 
11 1339   DUKE SENIOR. I think he be transform'd into a beast;
11 1340     For I can nowhere find him like a man.
11 1341 
11 1342   FIRST LORD. My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
11 1343     Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
11 1344 
11 1345   DUKE SENIOR. If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
11 1346     We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
11 1347     Go seek him; tell him I would speak with him.
11 1348 
11 1349                          Enter JAQUES
11 1350 
11 1351 
11 1352   FIRST LORD. He saves my labour by his own approach.
11 1353 
11 1354   DUKE SENIOR. Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
11 1355     That your poor friends must woo your company?
11 1356     What, you look merrily!
11 1357 
11 1358   JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest,
11 1359     A motley fool. A miserable world!
11 1360     As I do live by food, I met a fool,
11 1361     Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
11 1362     And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
11 1363     In good set terms- and yet a motley fool.
11 1364     'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I; 'No, sir,' quoth he,
11 1365     'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.'
11 1366     And then he drew a dial from his poke,
11 1367     And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
11 1368     Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock;
11 1369     Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags;
11 1370     'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
11 1371     And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
11 1372     And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
11 1373     And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
11 1374     And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
11 1375     The motley fool thus moral on the time,
11 1376     My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
11 1377     That fools should be so deep contemplative;
11 1378     And I did laugh sans intermission
11 1379     An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
11 1380     A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
11 1381 
11 1382   DUKE SENIOR. What fool is this?
11 1383 
11 1384   JAQUES. O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
11 1385     And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
11 1386     They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
11 1387     Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
11 1388     After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
11 1389     With observation, the which he vents
11 1390     In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
11 1391     I am ambitious for a motley coat.
11 1392 
11 1393   DUKE SENIOR. Thou shalt have one.
11 1394 
11 1395   JAQUES. It is my only suit,
11 1396     Provided that you weed your better judgments
11 1397     Of all opinion that grows rank in them
11 1398     That I am wise. I must have liberty
11 1399     Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
11 1400     To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;
11 1401     And they that are most galled with my folly,
11 1402     They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
11 1403     The why is plain as way to parish church:
11 1404     He that a fool doth very wisely hit
11 1405     Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
11 1406     Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,
11 1407     The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
11 1408     Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.
11 1409     Invest me in my motley; give me leave
11 1410     To speak my mind, and I will through and through
11 1411     Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,
11 1412     If they will patiently receive my medicine.
11 1413 
11 1414   DUKE SENIOR. Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
11 1415 
11 1416   JAQUES. What, for a counter, would I do but good?
11 1417 
11 1418   DUKE SENIOR. Most Mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
11 1419     For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
11 1420     As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
11 1421     And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
11 1422     That thou with license of free foot hast caught
11 1423     Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
11 1424 
11 1425   JAQUES. Why, who cries out on pride
11 1426     That can therein tax any private party?
11 1427     Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
11 1428     Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?
11 1429     What woman in the city do I name
11 1430     When that I say the city-woman bears
11 1431     The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
11 1432     Who can come in and say that I mean her,
11 1433     When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
11 1434     Or what is he of basest function
11 1435     That says his bravery is not on my cost,
11 1436     Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
11 1437     His folly to the mettle of my speech?
11 1438     There then! how then? what then? Let me see wherein
11 1439     My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
11 1440     Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
11 1441     Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
11 1442     Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
11 1443 
11 1444              Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn
11 1445 
11 1446 
11 1447   ORLANDO. Forbear, and eat no more.
11 1448 
11 1449   JAQUES. Why, I have eat none yet.
11 1450 
11 1451   ORLANDO. Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv'd.
11 1452 
11 1453   JAQUES. Of what kind should this cock come of?
11 1454 
11 1455   DUKE SENIOR. Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress?
11 1456     Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
11 1457     That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
11 1458 
11 1459   ORLANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
11 1460     Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
11 1461     Of smooth civility; yet arn I inland bred,
11 1462     And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;
11 1463     He dies that touches any of this fruit
11 1464     Till I and my affairs are answered.
11 1465 
11 1466   JAQUES. An you will not be answer'd with reason, I must die.
11 1467 
11 1468   DUKE SENIOR. What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
11 1469     More than your force move us to gentleness.
11 1470 
11 1471   ORLANDO. I almost die for food, and let me have it.
11 1472 
11 1473   DUKE SENIOR. Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
11 1474 
11 1475   ORLANDO. Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you;
11 1476     I thought that all things had been savage here,
11 1477     And therefore put I on the countenance
11 1478     Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
11 1479     That in this desert inaccessible,
11 1480     Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
11 1481     Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
11 1482     If ever you have look'd on better days,
11 1483     If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
11 1484     If ever sat at any good man's feast,
11 1485     If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear,
11 1486     And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
11 1487     Let gentleness my strong enforcement be;
11 1488     In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
11 1489 
11 1490   DUKE SENIOR. True is it that we have seen better days,
11 1491     And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
11 1492     And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes
11 1493     Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;
11 1494     And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
11 1495     And take upon command what help we have
11 1496     That to your wanting may be minist'red.
11 1497 
11 1498   ORLANDO. Then but forbear your food a little while,
11 1499     Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
11 1500     And give it food. There is an old poor man
11 1501     Who after me hath many a weary step
11 1502     Limp'd in pure love; till he be first suffic'd,
11 1503     Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
11 1504     I will not touch a bit.
11 1505 
11 1506   DUKE SENIOR. Go find him out.
11 1507     And we will nothing waste till you return.
11 1508 
11 1509   ORLANDO. I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
11 1510  Exit
11 1511 
11 1512   DUKE SENIOR. Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
11 1513     This wide and universal theatre
11 1514     Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
11 1515     Wherein we play in.
11 1516 
11 1517   JAQUES. All the world's a stage,
11 1518     And all the men and women merely players;
11 1519     They have their exits and their entrances;
11 1520     And one man in his time plays many parts,
11 1521     His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
11 1522     Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
11 1523     Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
11 1524     And shining morning face, creeping like snail
11 1525     Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
11 1526     Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
11 1527     Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
11 1528     Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
11 1529     Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
11 1530     Seeking the bubble reputation
11 1531     Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
11 1532     In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,
11 1533     With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
11 1534     Full of wise saws and modern instances;
11 1535     And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
11 1536     Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
11 1537     With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
11 1538     His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
11 1539     For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
11 1540     Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
11 1541     And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
11 1542     That ends this strange eventful history,
11 1543     Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
11 1544     Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
11 1545 
11 1546                   Re-enter ORLANDO with ADAM
11 1547 
11 1548 
11 1549   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome. Set down your venerable burden.
11 1550     And let him feed.
11 1551 
11 1552   ORLANDO. I thank you most for him.
11 1553 
11 1554   ADAM. So had you need;
11 1555     I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
11 1556 
11 1557   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome; fall to. I will not trouble you
11 1558     As yet to question you about your fortunes.
11 1559     Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
11 1560 
11 1561                          SONG
11 1562             Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
11 1563             Thou art not so unkind
11 1564               As man's ingratitude;
11 1565             Thy tooth is not so keen,
11 1566             Because thou art not seen,
11 1567               Although thy breath be rude.
11 1568     Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly.
11 1569     Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.
11 1570             Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
11 1571               This life is most jolly.
11 1572 
11 1573             Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
11 1574             That dost not bite so nigh
11 1575               As benefits forgot;
11 1576             Though thou the waters warp,
11 1577             Thy sting is not so sharp
11 1578               As friend rememb'red not.
11 1579     Heigh-ho! sing, &c.
11 1580 
11 1581 
11 1582   DUKE SENIOR. If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
11 1583     As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
11 1584     And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
11 1585     Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
11 1586     Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke
11 1587     That lov'd your father. The residue of your fortune,
11 1588     Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
11 1589     Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
11 1590     Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
11 1591     And let me all your fortunes understand.              Exeunt
11 1592 
11 1593 
11 1594 
11 1595 
11 1596 ACT III. SCENE I.
11 1597 
11 1598 The palace
11 1599 
11 1600 Enter DUKE FREDERICK, OLIVER, and LORDS
11 1601 
11 1602 
11 1603   FREDERICK. Not see him since! Sir, sir, that cannot be.
11 1604     But were I not the better part made mercy,
11 1605     I should not seek an absent argument
11 1606     Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
11 1607     Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is;
11 1608     Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
11 1609     Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
11 1610     To seek a living in our territory.
11 1611     Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
11 1612     Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
11 1613     Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
11 1614     Of what we think against thee.
11 1615 
11 1616   OLIVER. O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
11 1617     I never lov'd my brother in my life.
11 1618 
11 1619   FREDERICK. More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
11 1620     And let my officers of such a nature
11 1621     Make an extent upon his house and lands.
11 1622     Do this expediently, and turn him going.              Exeunt
11 1623 
11 1624 
11 1625 SCENE II.
11 1626 
11 1627 The forest
11 1628 
11 1629 Enter ORLANDO, with a paper
11 1630 
11 1631 
11 1632   ORLANDO. Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love;
11 1633     And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
11 1634     With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
11 1635     Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
11 1636     O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
11 1637     And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
11 1638     That every eye which in this forest looks
11 1639     Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
11 1640     Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree,
11 1641     The fair, the chaste, and unexpressive she.             Exit
11 1642 
11 1643                      Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
11 1644 
11 1645 
11 1646   CORIN. And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
11 1647 
11 1648   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
11 1649     life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought.
11 1650     In respect that it is solitary, I like it very well; but in
11 1651     respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. Now in
11 1652     respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect
11 1653     it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life,
11 1654     look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty
11 1655     in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in
11 1656     thee, shepherd?
11 1657 
11 1658   CORIN. No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
11 1659     ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is
11 1660     without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,
11 1661     and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a
11 1662     great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath
11 1663     learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,
11 1664     or comes of a very dull kindred.
11 1665 
11 1666   TOUCHSTONE. Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
11 1667     court, shepherd?
11 1668 
11 1669   CORIN. No, truly.
11 1670 
11 1671   TOUCHSTONE. Then thou art damn'd.
11 1672 
11 1673   CORIN. Nay, I hope.
11 1674 
11 1675   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
11 1676     one side.
11 1677 
11 1678   CORIN. For not being at court? Your reason.
11 1679 
11 1680   TOUCHSTONE. Why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
11 1681     manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must
11 1682     be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art
11 1683     in a parlous state, shepherd.
11 1684 
11 1685   CORIN. Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the
11 1686     court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
11 1687     country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not
11 1688     at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be
11 1689     uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
11 1690 
11 1691   TOUCHSTONE. Instance, briefly; come, instance.
11 1692 
11 1693   CORIN. Why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
11 1694     know, are greasy.
11 1695 
11 1696   TOUCHSTONE. Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? And is not the
11 1697     grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?
11 1698     Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
11 1699 
11 1700   CORIN. Besides, our hands are hard.
11 1701 
11 1702   TOUCHSTONE. Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
11 1703     A more sounder instance; come.
11 1704 
11 1705   CORIN. And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
11 1706     sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier's hands are
11 1707     perfum'd with civet.
11 1708 
11 1709   TOUCHSTONE. Most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
11 1710     piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is
11 1711     of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat.
11 1712     Mend the instance, shepherd.
11 1713 
11 1714   CORIN. You have too courtly a wit for me; I'll rest.
11 1715 
11 1716   TOUCHSTONE. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God help thee, shallow man!
11 1717     God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
11 1718 
11 1719   CORIN. Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get that I
11 1720     wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
11 1721     men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is
11 1722     to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.
11 1723 
11 1724   TOUCHSTONE. That is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes
11 1725     and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the
11 1726     copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray
11 1727     a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
11 1728     out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn'd for this,
11 1729     the devil himself will have no shepherds; I cannot see else how
11 1730     thou shouldst scape.
11 1731 
11 1732   CORIN. Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.
11 1733 
11 1734                   Enter ROSALIND, reading a paper
11 1735 
11 1736 
11 1737   ROSALIND.   'From the east to western Inde,
11 1738               No jewel is like Rosalinde.
11 1739               Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
11 1740               Through all the world bears Rosalinde.
11 1741               All the pictures fairest lin'd
11 1742               Are but black to Rosalinde.
11 1743               Let no face be kept in mind
11 1744               But the fair of Rosalinde.'
11 1745 
11 1746   TOUCHSTONE. I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners, and
11 1747     suppers, and sleeping hours, excepted. It is the right
11 1748     butter-women's rank to market.
11 1749 
11 1750   ROSALIND. Out, fool!
11 1751 
11 1752   TOUCHSTONE.   For a taste:
11 1753                 If a hart do lack a hind,
11 1754                 Let him seek out Rosalinde.
11 1755                 If the cat will after kind,
11 1756                 So be sure will Rosalinde.
11 1757                 Winter garments must be lin'd,
11 1758                 So must slender Rosalinde.
11 1759                 They that reap must sheaf and bind,
11 1760                 Then to cart with Rosalinde.
11 1761                 Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
11 1762                 Such a nut is Rosalinde.
11 1763                 He that sweetest rose will find
11 1764                 Must find love's prick and Rosalinde.
11 1765     This is the very false gallop of verses; why do you infect
11 1766     yourself with them?
11 1767 
11 1768   ROSALIND. Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
11 1769 
11 1770   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
11 1771 
11 1772   ROSALIND. I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it with a
11 1773     medlar. Then it will be the earliest fruit i' th' country; for
11 1774     you'll be rotten ere you be half ripe, and that's the right
11 1775     virtue of the medlar.
11 1776 
11 1777   TOUCHSTONE. You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the forest
11 1778     judge.
11 1779 
11 1780                       Enter CELIA, with a writing
11 1781 
11 1782 
11 1783   ROSALIND. Peace!
11 1784     Here comes my sister, reading; stand aside.
11 1785 
11 1786   CELIA.   'Why should this a desert be?
11 1787              For it is unpeopled? No;
11 1788            Tongues I'll hang on every tree
11 1789              That shall civil sayings show.
11 1790            Some, how brief the life of man
11 1791              Runs his erring pilgrimage,
11 1792            That the streching of a span
11 1793              Buckles in his sum of age;
11 1794            Some, of violated vows
11 1795              'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
11 1796            But upon the fairest boughs,
11 1797              Or at every sentence end,
11 1798            Will I Rosalinda write,
11 1799              Teaching all that read to know
11 1800            The quintessence of every sprite
11 1801              Heaven would in little show.
11 1802            Therefore heaven Nature charg'd
11 1803              That one body should be fill'd
11 1804            With all graces wide-enlarg'd.
11 1805              Nature presently distill'd
11 1806            Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
11 1807              Cleopatra's majesty,
11 1808            Atalanta's better part,
11 1809              Sad Lucretia's modesty.
11 1810            Thus Rosalinde of many parts
11 1811              By heavenly synod was devis'd,
11 1812            Of many faces, eyes, and hearts,
11 1813              To have the touches dearest priz'd.
11 1814            Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
11 1815            And I to live and die her slave.'
11 1816 
11 1817   ROSALIND. O most gentle pulpiter! What tedious homily of love have
11 1818     you wearied your parishioners withal, and never cried 'Have
11 1819     patience, good people.'
11 1820 
11 1821   CELIA. How now! Back, friends; shepherd, go off a little; go with
11 1822     him, sirrah.
11 1823 
11 1824   TOUCHSTONE. Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
11 1825 
11 1826     though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
11 1827                                      Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
11 1828 
11 1829   CELIA. Didst thou hear these verses?
11 1830 
11 1831   ROSALIND. O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of them
11 1832     had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
11 1833 
11 1834   CELIA. That's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.
11 1835 
11 1836   ROSALIND. Ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
11 1837     without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.
11 1838 
11 1839   CELIA. But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
11 1840     hang'd and carved upon these trees?
11 1841 
11 1842   ROSALIND. I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
11 1843     came; for look here what I found on a palm-tree. I was never so
11 1844     berhym'd since Pythagoras' time that I was an Irish rat,
11 1845     which I can hardly remember.
11 1846 
11 1847   CELIA. Trow you who hath done this?
11 1848 
11 1849   ROSALIND. Is it a man?
11 1850 
11 1851   CELIA. And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
11 1852     Change you colour?
11 1853 
11 1854   ROSALIND. I prithee, who?
11 1855 
11 1856   CELIA. O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to meet; but
11 1857     mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes, and so encounter.
11 1858 
11 1859   ROSALIND. Nay, but who is it?
11 1860 
11 1861   CELIA. Is it possible?
11 1862 
11 1863   ROSALIND. Nay, I prithee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell
11 1864     me who it is.
11 1865 
11 1866   CELIA. O wonderful, wonderful, most wonderful wonderful, and yet
11 1867     again wonderful, and after that, out of all whooping!
11 1868 
11 1869   ROSALIND. Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
11 1870     caparison'd like a man, I have a doublet and hose in my
11 1871     disposition? One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery.
11 1872     I prithee tell me who is it quickly, and speak apace. I would
11 1873     thou could'st stammer, that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man
11 1874     out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of narrow-mouth'd bottle-
11 1875     either too much at once or none at all. I prithee take the cork
11 1876     out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings.
11 1877 
11 1878   CELIA. So you may put a man in your belly.
11 1879 
11 1880   ROSALIND. Is he of God's making? What manner of man?
11 1881     Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?
11 1882 
11 1883   CELIA. Nay, he hath but a little beard.
11 1884 
11 1885   ROSALIND. Why, God will send more if the man will be thankful.
11 1886     Let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the
11 1887     knowledge of his chin.
11 1888 
11 1889   CELIA. It is young Orlando, that tripp'd up the wrestler's heels
11 1890     and your heart both in an instant.
11 1891 
11 1892   ROSALIND. Nay, but the devil take mocking! Speak sad brow and true
11 1893     maid.
11 1894 
11 1895   CELIA. I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
11 1896 
11 1897   ROSALIND. Orlando?
11 1898 
11 1899   CELIA. Orlando.
11 1900 
11 1901   ROSALIND. Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and hose?
11 1902     What did he when thou saw'st him? What said he? How look'd he?
11 1903     Wherein went he? What makes he here? Did he ask for me? Where
11 1904     remains he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him
11 1905     again? Answer me in one word.
11 1906 
11 1907   CELIA. You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first; 'tis a word too
11 1908     great for any mouth of this age's size. To say ay and no to these
11 1909     particulars is more than to answer in a catechism.
11 1910 
11 1911   ROSALIND. But doth he know that I am in this forest, and in man's
11 1912     apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled?
11 1913 
11 1914   CELIA. It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
11 1915     propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my finding him, and
11 1916     relish it with good observance. I found him under a tree, like a
11 1917     dropp'd acorn.
11 1918 
11 1919   ROSALIND. It may well be call'd Jove's tree, when it drops forth
11 1920     such fruit.
11 1921 
11 1922   CELIA. Give me audience, good madam.
11 1923 
11 1924   ROSALIND. Proceed.
11 1925 
11 1926   CELIA. There lay he, stretch'd along like a wounded knight.
11 1927 
11 1928   ROSALIND. Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well becomes
11 1929     the ground.
11 1930 
11 1931   CELIA. Cry 'Holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
11 1932     unseasonably. He was furnish'd like a hunter.
11 1933 
11 1934   ROSALIND. O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
11 1935 
11 1936   CELIA. I would sing my song without a burden; thou bring'st me out
11 1937     of tune.
11 1938 
11 1939   ROSALIND. Do you not know I am a woman? When I think, I must speak.
11 1940     Sweet, say on.
11 1941 
11 1942   CELIA. You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
11 1943 
11 1944                    Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
11 1945 
11 1946 
11 1947   ROSALIND. 'Tis he; slink by, and note him.
11 1948 
11 1949   JAQUES. I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had as
11 1950     lief have been myself alone.
11 1951 
11 1952   ORLANDO. And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you too
11 1953     for your society.
11 1954 
11 1955   JAQUES. God buy you; let's meet as little as we can.
11 1956 
11 1957   ORLANDO. I do desire we may be better strangers.
11 1958 
11 1959   JAQUES. I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
11 1960     their barks.
11 1961 
11 1962   ORLANDO. I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
11 1963     ill-favouredly.
11 1964 
11 1965   JAQUES. Rosalind is your love's name?
11 1966 
11 1967   ORLANDO. Yes, just.
11 1968 
11 1969   JAQUES. I do not like her name.
11 1970 
11 1971   ORLANDO. There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
11 1972     christen'd.
11 1973 
11 1974   JAQUES. What stature is she of?
11 1975 
11 1976   ORLANDO. Just as high as my heart.
11 1977 
11 1978   JAQUES. You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
11 1979     acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conn'd them out of rings?
11 1980 
11 1981   ORLANDO. Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from whence
11 1982     you have studied your questions.
11 1983 
11 1984   JAQUES. You have a nimble wit; I think 'twas made of Atalanta's
11 1985     heels. Will you sit down with me? and we two will rail against
11 1986     our mistress the world, and all our misery.
11 1987 
11 1988   ORLANDO. I will chide no breather in the world but myself, against
11 1989     whom I know most faults.
11 1990 
11 1991   JAQUES. The worst fault you have is to be in love.
11 1992 
11 1993   ORLANDO. 'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue. I am
11 1994     weary of you.
11 1995 
11 1996   JAQUES. By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found you.
11 1997 
11 1998   ORLANDO. He is drown'd in the brook; look but in, and you shall see
11 1999     him.
11 2000 
11 2001   JAQUES. There I shall see mine own figure.
11 2002 
11 2003   ORLANDO. Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
11 2004 
11 2005   JAQUES. I'll tarry no longer with you; farewell, good Signior Love.
11 2006 
11 2007   ORLANDO. I am glad of your departure; adieu, good Monsieur
11 2008     Melancholy.
11 2009                                                      Exit JAQUES
11 2010 
11 2011 
11 2012   ROSALIND. [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him like a saucy lackey,
11 2013     and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear,
11 2014     forester?
11 2015 
11 2016   ORLANDO. Very well; what would you?
11 2017 
11 2018   ROSALIND. I pray you, what is't o'clock?
11 2019 
11 2020   ORLANDO. You should ask me what time o' day; there's no clock in
11 2021     the forest.
11 2022 
11 2023   ROSALIND. Then there is no true lover in the forest, else sighing
11 2024     every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
11 2025     of Time as well as a clock.
11 2026 
11 2027   ORLANDO. And why not the swift foot of Time? Had not that been as
11 2028     proper?
11 2029 
11 2030   ROSALIND. By no means, sir. Time travels in divers paces with
11 2031     divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles withal, who Time
11 2032     trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands still
11 2033     withal.
11 2034 
11 2035   ORLANDO. I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
11 2036 
11 2037   ROSALIND. Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
11 2038     contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd; if the
11 2039     interim be but a se'nnight, Time's pace is so hard that it seems
11 2040     the length of seven year.
11 2041 
11 2042   ORLANDO. Who ambles Time withal?
11 2043 
11 2044   ROSALIND. With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
11 2045     not the gout; for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study,
11 2046     and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain; the one
11 2047     lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning, the other
11 2048     knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury. These Time ambles
11 2049     withal.
11 2050 
11 2051   ORLANDO. Who doth he gallop withal?
11 2052 
11 2053   ROSALIND. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as softly
11 2054     as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
11 2055 
11 2056   ORLANDO. Who stays it still withal?
11 2057 
11 2058   ROSALIND. With lawyers in the vacation; for they sleep between term
11 2059     and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves.
11 2060 
11 2061   ORLANDO. Where dwell you, pretty youth?
11 2062 
11 2063   ROSALIND. With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the skirts of
11 2064     the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
11 2065 
11 2066   ORLANDO. Are you native of this place?
11 2067 
11 2068   ROSALIND. As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled.
11 2069 
11 2070   ORLANDO. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
11 2071     so removed a dwelling.
11 2072 
11 2073   ROSALIND. I have been told so of many; but indeed an old religious
11 2074     uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his youth an inland
11 2075     man; one that knew courtship too well, for there he fell in love.
11 2076     I have heard him read many lectures against it; and I thank God I
11 2077     am not a woman, to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he
11 2078     hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.
11 2079 
11 2080   ORLANDO. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
11 2081     to the charge of women?
11 2082 
11 2083   ROSALIND. There were none principal; they were all like one another
11 2084     as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his
11 2085     fellow-fault came to match it.
11 2086 
11 2087   ORLANDO. I prithee recount some of them.
11 2088 
11 2089   ROSALIND. No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
11 2090     sick. There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
11 2091     plants with carving 'Rosalind' on their barks; hangs odes upon
11 2092     hawthorns and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the
11 2093     name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give
11 2094     him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love
11 2095     upon him.
11 2096 
11 2097   ORLANDO. I am he that is so love-shak'd; I pray you tell me your
11 2098     remedy.
11 2099 
11 2100   ROSALIND. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
11 2101     how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you
11 2102     are not prisoner.
11 2103 
11 2104   ORLANDO. What were his marks?
11 2105 
11 2106   ROSALIND. A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
11 2107     which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;
11 2108     a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,
11 2109     for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.
11 2110     Then your hose should be ungarter'd, your bonnet unbanded, your
11 2111     sleeve unbutton'd, your shoe untied, and every thing about you
11 2112     demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you
11 2113     are rather point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself
11 2114     than seeming the lover of any other.
11 2115 
11 2116   ORLANDO. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
11 2117 
11 2118   ROSALIND. Me believe it! You may as soon make her that you love
11 2119     believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to do than to confess
11 2120     she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give
11 2121     the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he that
11 2122     hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired?
11 2123 
11 2124   ORLANDO. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I
11 2125     am that he, that unfortunate he.
11 2126 
11 2127   ROSALIND. But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
11 2128 
11 2129   ORLANDO. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
11 2130 
11 2131   ROSALIND. Love is merely a madness; and, I tell you, deserves as
11 2132     well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
11 2133     they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
11 2134     ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing
11 2135     it by counsel.
11 2136 
11 2137   ORLANDO. Did you ever cure any so?
11 2138 
11 2139   ROSALIND. Yes, one; and in this manner. He was to imagine me his
11 2140     love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me; at which
11 2141     time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,
11 2142     changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,
11 2143     shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every
11 2144     passion something and for no passion truly anything, as boys and
11 2145     women are for the most part cattle of this colour; would now like
11 2146     him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now
11 2147     weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his
11 2148     mad humour of love to a living humour of madness; which was, to
11 2149     forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
11 2150     merely monastic. And thus I cur'd him; and this way will I take
11 2151     upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,
11 2152     that there shall not be one spot of love in 't.
11 2153 
11 2154   ORLANDO. I would not be cured, youth.
11 2155 
11 2156   ROSALIND. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and
11 2157     come every day to my cote and woo me.
11 2158 
11 2159   ORLANDO. Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.
11 2160 
11 2161   ROSALIND. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you; and, by the way,
11 2162     you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?
11 2163 
11 2164   ORLANDO. With all my heart, good youth.
11 2165 
11 2166   ROSALIND. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you
11 2167     go?                                                   Exeunt
11 2168 
11 2169 
11 2170 SCENE III.
11 2171 
11 2172 The forest
11 2173 
11 2174 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind
11 2175 
11 2176 
11 2177   TOUCHSTONE. Come apace, good Audrey; I will fetch up your goats,
11 2178     Audrey. And how, Audrey, am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature
11 2179     content you?
11 2180 
11 2181   AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
11 2182 
11 2183   TOUCHSTONE. I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
11 2184     capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
11 2185 
11 2186   JAQUES. [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove in a
11 2187     thatch'd house!
11 2188 
11 2189   TOUCHSTONE. When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's
11 2190     good wit seconded with the forward child understanding, it
11 2191     strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.
11 2192     Truly, I would the gods had made thee poetical.
11 2193 
11 2194   AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
11 2195     word? Is it a true thing?
11 2196 
11 2197   TOUCHSTONE. No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning,
11 2198     and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may
11 2199     be said as lovers they do feign.
11 2200 
11 2201   AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
11 2202 
11 2203   TOUCHSTONE. I do, truly, for thou swear'st to me thou art honest;
11 2204     now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some hope thou didst
11 2205     feign.
11 2206 
11 2207   AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?
11 2208 
11 2209   TOUCHSTONE. No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favour'd; for honesty
11 2210     coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
11 2211 
11 2212   JAQUES. [Aside] A material fool!
11 2213 
11 2214   AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
11 2215     honest.
11 2216 
11 2217   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
11 2218     to put good meat into an unclean dish.
11 2219 
11 2220   AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
11 2221 
11 2222   TOUCHSTONE. Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness;
11 2223     sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may be, I will
11 2224     marry thee; and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext,
11 2225     the vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meet me in
11 2226     this place of the forest, and to couple us.
11 2227 
11 2228   JAQUES. [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.
11 2229 
11 2230   AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!
11 2231 
11 2232   TOUCHSTONE. Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger
11 2233     in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no
11 2234     assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are
11 2235     odious, they are necessary. It is said: 'Many a man knows no end
11 2236     of his goods.' Right! Many a man has good horns and knows no end
11 2237     of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife; 'tis none of his
11 2238     own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest
11 2239     deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore
11 2240     blessed? No; as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village, so
11 2241     is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
11 2242     brow of a bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
11 2243     skill, by so much is horn more precious than to want. Here comes
11 2244     Sir Oliver.
11 2245 
11 2246                        Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
11 2247 
11 2248     Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met. Will you dispatch us here
11 2249     under this tree, or shall we go with you to your chapel?
11 2250 
11 2251   MARTEXT. Is there none here to give the woman?
11 2252 
11 2253   TOUCHSTONE. I will not take her on gift of any man.
11 2254 
11 2255   MARTEXT. Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
11 2256 
11 2257   JAQUES. [Discovering himself] Proceed, proceed; I'll give her.
11 2258 
11 2259   TOUCHSTONE. Good even, good Master What-ye-call't; how do you, sir?
11 2260     You are very well met. Goddild you for your last company. I am
11 2261     very glad to see you. Even a toy in hand here, sir. Nay; pray be
11 2262     cover'd.
11 2263 
11 2264   JAQUES. Will you be married, motley?
11 2265 
11 2266   TOUCHSTONE. As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
11 2267     the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and as pigeons
11 2268     bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
11 2269 
11 2270   JAQUES. And will you, being a man of your breeding, be married
11 2271     under a bush, like a beggar? Get you to church and have a good
11 2272     priest that can tell you what marriage is; this fellow will but
11 2273     join you together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
11 2274     prove a shrunk panel, and like green timber warp, warp.
11 2275 
11 2276   TOUCHSTONE. [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
11 2277     married of him than of another; for he is not like to marry me
11 2278     well; and not being well married, it will be a good excuse for me
11 2279     hereafter to leave my wife.
11 2280 
11 2281   JAQUES. Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
11 2282 
11 2283   TOUCHSTONE. Come, sweet Audrey;
11 2284     We must be married or we must live in bawdry.
11 2285     Farewell, good Master Oliver. Not-
11 2286                O sweet Oliver,
11 2287                O brave Oliver,
11 2288            Leave me not behind thee.
11 2289     But-
11 2290                  Wind away,
11 2291                Begone, I say,
11 2292            I will not to wedding with thee.
11 2293                            Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE, and AUDREY
11 2294 
11 2295   MARTEXT. 'Tis no matter; ne'er a fantastical knave of them all
11 2296     shall flout me out of my calling.                       Exit
11 2297 
11 2298 
11 2299 SCENE IV.
11 2300 
11 2301 The forest
11 2302 
11 2303 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
11 2304 
11 2305 
11 2306   ROSALIND. Never talk to me; I will weep.
11 2307 
11 2308   CELIA. Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider that tears
11 2309     do not become a man.
11 2310 
11 2311   ROSALIND. But have I not cause to weep?
11 2312 
11 2313   CELIA. As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
11 2314 
11 2315   ROSALIND. His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
11 2316 
11 2317   CELIA. Something browner than Judas's.
11 2318     Marry, his kisses are Judas's own children.
11 2319 
11 2320   ROSALIND. I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
11 2321 
11 2322   CELIA. An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
11 2323 
11 2324   ROSALIND. And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
11 2325     holy bread.
11 2326 
11 2327   CELIA. He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of
11 2328     winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously; the very ice of
11 2329     chastity is in them.
11 2330 
11 2331   ROSALIND. But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
11 2332     comes not?
11 2333 
11 2334   CELIA. Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
11 2335 
11 2336   ROSALIND. Do you think so?
11 2337 
11 2338   CELIA. Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer; but
11 2339     for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as covered
11 2340     goblet or a worm-eaten nut.
11 2341 
11 2342   ROSALIND. Not true in love?
11 2343 
11 2344   CELIA. Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
11 2345 
11 2346   ROSALIND. You have heard him swear downright he was.
11 2347 
11 2348   CELIA. 'Was' is not 'is'; besides, the oath of a lover is no
11 2349     stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer
11 2350     of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke,
11 2351     your father.
11 2352 
11 2353   ROSALIND. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him.
11 2354     He asked me of what parentage I was; I told him, of as good as
11 2355     he; so he laugh'd and let me go. But what talk we of fathers when
11 2356     there is such a man as Orlando?
11 2357 
11 2358   CELIA. O, that's a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave
11 2359     words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite
11 2360     traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that
11 2361     spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
11 2362     goose. But all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides.
11 2363     Who comes here?
11 2364 
11 2365                          Enter CORIN
11 2366 
11 2367 
11 2368   CORIN. Mistress and master, you have oft enquired
11 2369     After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
11 2370     Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
11 2371     Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
11 2372     That was his mistress.
11 2373 
11 2374   CELIA. Well, and what of him?
11 2375 
11 2376   CORIN. If you will see a pageant truly play'd
11 2377     Between the pale complexion of true love
11 2378     And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
11 2379     Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,
11 2380     If you will mark it.
11 2381 
11 2382   ROSALIND. O, come, let us remove!
11 2383     The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
11 2384     Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
11 2385     I'll prove a busy actor in their play.                Exeunt
11 2386 
11 2387 
11 2388 SCENE V.
11 2389 
11 2390 Another part of the forest
11 2391 
11 2392 Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
11 2393 
11 2394 
11 2395   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe.
11 2396     Say that you love me not; but say not so
11 2397     In bitterness. The common executioner,
11 2398     Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
11 2399     Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
11 2400     But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be
11 2401     Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
11 2402 
11 2403           Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, at a distance
11 2404 
11 2405 
11 2406   PHEBE. I would not be thy executioner;
11 2407     I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
11 2408     Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye.
11 2409     'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
11 2410     That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
11 2411     Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
11 2412     Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
11 2413     Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
11 2414     And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
11 2415     Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;
11 2416     Or, if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
11 2417     Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.
11 2418     Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.
11 2419     Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
11 2420     Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,
11 2421     The cicatrice and capable impressure
11 2422     Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
11 2423     Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;
11 2424     Nor, I am sure, there is not force in eyes
11 2425     That can do hurt.
11 2426 
11 2427   SILVIUS. O dear Phebe,
11 2428     If ever- as that ever may be near-
11 2429     You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
11 2430     Then shall you know the wounds invisible
11 2431     That love's keen arrows make.
11 2432 
11 2433   PHEBE. But till that time
11 2434     Come not thou near me; and when that time comes,
11 2435     Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
11 2436     As till that time I shall not pity thee.
11 2437 
11 2438   ROSALIND. [Advancing] And why, I pray you? Who might be your
11 2439       mother,
11 2440     That you insult, exult, and all at once,
11 2441     Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty-
11 2442     As, by my faith, I see no more in you
11 2443     Than without candle may go dark to bed-
11 2444     Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
11 2445     Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
11 2446     I see no more in you than in the ordinary
11 2447     Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
11 2448     I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
11 2449     No faith, proud mistress, hope not after it;
11 2450     'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
11 2451     Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
11 2452     That can entame my spirits to your worship.
11 2453     You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
11 2454     Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?
11 2455     You are a thousand times a properer man
11 2456     Than she a woman. 'Tis such fools as you
11 2457     That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children.
11 2458     'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
11 2459     And out of you she sees herself more proper
11 2460     Than any of her lineaments can show her.
11 2461     But, mistress, know yourself. Down on your knees,
11 2462     And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;
11 2463     For I must tell you friendly in your ear:
11 2464     Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.
11 2465     Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;
11 2466     Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
11 2467     So take her to thee, shepherd. Fare you well.
11 2468 
11 2469   PHEBE. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a year together;
11 2470     I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
11 2471 
11 2472   ROSALIND. He's fall'n in love with your foulness, and she'll fall
11 2473     in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as she answers thee
11 2474     with frowning looks, I'll sauce her with bitter words. Why look
11 2475     you so upon me?
11 2476 
11 2477   PHEBE. For no ill will I bear you.
11 2478 
11 2479   ROSALIND. I pray you do not fall in love with me,
11 2480     For I am falser than vows made in wine;
11 2481     Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
11 2482     'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
11 2483     Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
11 2484     Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
11 2485     And be not proud; though all the world could see,
11 2486     None could be so abus'd in sight as he.
11 2487     Come, to our flock.        Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN
11 2488 
11 2489   PHEBE. Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might:
11 2490     'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?'
11 2491 
11 2492   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe.
11 2493 
11 2494   PHEBE. Ha! what say'st thou, Silvius?
11 2495 
11 2496   SILVIUS. Sweet Phebe, pity me.
11 2497 
11 2498   PHEBE. Why, I arn sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
11 2499 
11 2500   SILVIUS. Wherever sorrow is, relief would be.
11 2501     If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
11 2502     By giving love, your sorrow and my grief
11 2503     Were both extermin'd.
11 2504 
11 2505   PHEBE. Thou hast my love; is not that neighbourly?
11 2506 
11 2507   SILVIUS. I would have you.
11 2508 
11 2509   PHEBE. Why, that were covetousness.
11 2510     Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;
11 2511     And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
11 2512     But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
11 2513     Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
11 2514     I will endure; and I'll employ thee too.
11 2515     But do not look for further recompense
11 2516     Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
11 2517 
11 2518   SILVIUS. So holy and so perfect is my love,
11 2519     And I in such a poverty of grace,
11 2520     That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
11 2521     To glean the broken ears after the man
11 2522     That the main harvest reaps; loose now and then
11 2523     A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
11 2524 
11 2525   PHEBE. Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
11 2526 
11 2527   SILVIUS. Not very well; but I have met him oft;
11 2528     And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
11 2529     That the old carlot once was master of.
11 2530 
11 2531   PHEBE. Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
11 2532     'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.
11 2533     But what care I for words? Yet words do well
11 2534     When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
11 2535     It is a pretty youth- not very pretty;
11 2536     But, sure, he's proud; and yet his pride becomes him.
11 2537     He'll make a proper man. The best thing in him
11 2538     Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
11 2539     Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
11 2540     He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;
11 2541     His leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
11 2542     There was a pretty redness in his lip,
11 2543     A little riper and more lusty red
11 2544     Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
11 2545     Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
11 2546     There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
11 2547     In parcels as I did, would have gone near
11 2548     To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
11 2549     I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
11 2550     I have more cause to hate him than to love him;
11 2551     For what had he to do to chide at me?
11 2552     He said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
11 2553     And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
11 2554     I marvel why I answer'd not again;
11 2555     But that's all one: omittance is no quittance.
11 2556     I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
11 2557     And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
11 2558 
11 2559   SILVIUS. Phebe, with all my heart.
11 2560 
11 2561   PHEBE. I'll write it straight;
11 2562     The matter's in my head and in my heart;
11 2563     I will be bitter with him and passing short.
11 2564     Go with me, Silvius.                                  Exeunt

11 2579 ACT IV. SCENE I.
11 2580 
11 2581 The forest
11 2582 
11 2583 Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES
11 2584 
11 2585 
11 2586   JAQUES. I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with
11 2587     thee.
11 2588 
11 2589   ROSALIND. They say you are a melancholy fellow.
11 2590 
11 2591   JAQUES. I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
11 2592 
11 2593   ROSALIND. Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
11 2594     fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
11 2595     drunkards.
11 2596 
11 2597   JAQUES. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
11 2598 
11 2599   ROSALIND. Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
11 2600 
11 2601   JAQUES. I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
11 2602     emulation; nor the musician's, which is fantastical; nor the
11 2603     courtier's, which is proud; nor the soldier's, which is
11 2604     ambitious; nor the lawyer's, which is politic; nor the lady's,
11 2605     which is nice; nor the lover's, which is all these; but it is a
11 2606     melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted
11 2607     from many objects, and, indeed, the sundry contemplation of my
11 2608     travels; in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous
11 2609     sadness.
11 2610 
11 2611   ROSALIND. A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be
11 2612     sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men's; then
11 2613     to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
11 2614     poor hands.
11 2615 
11 2616   JAQUES. Yes, I have gain'd my experience.
11 2617 
11 2618                         Enter ORLANDO
11 2619 
11 2620 
11 2621   ROSALIND. And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a
11 2622     fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to
11 2623     travel for it too.
11 2624 
11 2625   ORLANDO. Good day, and happiness, dear Rosalind!
11 2626 
11 2627   JAQUES. Nay, then, God buy you, an you talk in blank verse.
11 2628 
11 2629   ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller; look you lisp and wear
11 2630     strange suits, disable all the benefits of your own country, be
11 2631     out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making
11 2632     you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have
11 2633     swam in a gondola. [Exit JAQUES] Why, how now, Orlando! where
11 2634     have you been all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
11 2635     another trick, never come in my sight more.
11 2636 
11 2637   ORLANDO. My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
11 2638 
11 2639   ROSALIND. Break an hour's promise in love! He that will divide a
11 2640     minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the
11 2641     thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said
11 2642     of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o' th' shoulder, but I'll
11 2643     warrant him heart-whole.
11 2644 
11 2645   ORLANDO. Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
11 2646 
11 2647   ROSALIND. Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had
11 2648     as lief be woo'd of a snail.
11 2649 
11 2650   ORLANDO. Of a snail!
11 2651 
11 2652   ROSALIND. Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries
11 2653     his house on his head- a better jointure, I think, than you make
11 2654     a woman; besides, he brings his destiny with him.
11 2655 
11 2656   ORLANDO. What's that?
11 2657 
11 2658   ROSALIND. Why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to
11 2659     your wives for; but he comes armed in his fortune, and prevents
11 2660     the slander of his wife.
11 2661 
11 2662   ORLANDO. Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
11 2663 
11 2664   ROSALIND. And I am your Rosalind.
11 2665 
11 2666   CELIA. It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a
11 2667     better leer than you.
11 2668 
11 2669   ROSALIND. Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humour,
11 2670     and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, an I
11 2671     were your very very Rosalind?
11 2672 
11 2673   ORLANDO. I would kiss before I spoke.
11 2674 
11 2675   ROSALIND. Nay, you were better speak first; and when you were
11 2676     gravell'd for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss.
11 2677     Very good orators, when they are out, they will spit; and for
11 2678     lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter, the cleanliest shift is to
11 2679     kiss.
11 2680 
11 2681   ORLANDO. How if the kiss be denied?
11 2682 
11 2683   ROSALIND. Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new
11 2684     matter.
11 2685 
11 2686   ORLANDO. Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
11 2687 
11 2688   ROSALIND. Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress; or I
11 2689     should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
11 2690 
11 2691   ORLANDO. What, of my suit?
11 2692 
11 2693   ROSALIND. Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
11 2694     Am not I your Rosalind?
11 2695 
11 2696   ORLANDO. I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking
11 2697     of her.
11 2698 
11 2699   ROSALIND. Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.
11 2700 
11 2701   ORLANDO. Then, in mine own person, I die.
11 2702 
11 2703   ROSALIND. No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six
11 2704     thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man
11 2705     died in his own person, videlicet, in a love-cause. Troilus had
11 2706     his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
11 2707     could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love.
11 2708     Leander, he would have liv'd many a fair year, though Hero had
11 2709     turn'd nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for,
11 2710     good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and,
11 2711     being taken with the cramp, was drown'd; and the foolish
11 2712     chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos. But these
11 2713     are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have
11 2714     eaten them, but not for love.
11 2715 
11 2716   ORLANDO. I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind; for,
11 2717     I protest, her frown might kill me.
11 2718 
11 2719   ROSALIND. By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I
11 2720     will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me
11 2721     what you will, I will grant it.
11 2722 
11 2723   ORLANDO. Then love me, Rosalind.
11 2724 
11 2725   ROSALIND. Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays, and all.
11 2726 
11 2727   ORLANDO. And wilt thou have me?
11 2728 
11 2729   ROSALIND. Ay, and twenty such.
11 2730 
11 2731   ORLANDO. What sayest thou?
11 2732 
11 2733   ROSALIND. Are you not good?
11 2734 
11 2735   ORLANDO. I hope so.
11 2736 
11 2737   ROSALIND. Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
11 2738     Come, sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand,
11 2739     Orlando. What do you say, sister?
11 2740 
11 2741   ORLANDO. Pray thee, marry us.
11 2742 
11 2743   CELIA. I cannot say the words.
11 2744 
11 2745   ROSALIND. You must begin 'Will you, Orlando'-
11 2746 
11 2747   CELIA. Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
11 2748 
11 2749   ORLANDO. I will.
11 2750 
11 2751   ROSALIND. Ay, but when?
11 2752 
11 2753   ORLANDO. Why, now; as fast as she can marry us.
11 2754 
11 2755   ROSALIND. Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
11 2756 
11 2757   ORLANDO. I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
11 2758 
11 2759   ROSALIND. I might ask you for your commission; but- I do take thee,
11 2760     Orlando, for my husband. There's a girl goes before the priest;
11 2761     and, certainly, a woman's thought runs before her actions.
11 2762 
11 2763   ORLANDO. So do all thoughts; they are wing'd.
11 2764 
11 2765   ROSALIND. Now tell me how long you would have her, after you have
11 2766     possess'd her.
11 2767 
11 2768   ORLANDO. For ever and a day.
11 2769 
11 2770   ROSALIND. Say 'a day' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; men are
11 2771     April when they woo, December when they wed: maids are May when
11 2772     they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will
11 2773     be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
11 2774     more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than
11 2775     an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for
11 2776     nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you
11 2777     are dispos'd to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and that when
11 2778     thou are inclin'd to sleep.
11 2779 
11 2780   ORLANDO. But will my Rosalind do so?
11 2781 
11 2782   ROSALIND. By my life, she will do as I do.
11 2783 
11 2784   ORLANDO. O, but she is wise.
11 2785 
11 2786   ROSALIND. Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser,
11 2787     the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman's wit, and it will out
11 2788     at the casement; shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole; stop
11 2789     that, 'twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.
11 2790 
11 2791   ORLANDO. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 'Wit,
11 2792     whither wilt?' ROSALIND. Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your
11 2793     wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
11 2794 
11 2795   ORLANDO. And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
11 2796 
11 2797   ROSALIND. Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never
11 2798     take her without her answer, unless you take her without her
11 2799     tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband's
11 2800     occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will
11 2801     breed it like a fool!
11 2802 
11 2803   ORLANDO. For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
11 2804 
11 2805   ROSALIND. Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!
11 2806 
11 2807   ORLANDO. I must attend the Duke at dinner; by two o'clock I will be
11 2808     with thee again.
11 2809 
11 2810   ROSALIND. Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would
11 2811     prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less.
11 2812     That flattering tongue of yours won me. 'Tis but one cast away, and
11 2813     so, come death! Two o'clock is your hour?
11 2814 
11 2815   ORLANDO. Ay, sweet Rosalind.
11 2816 
11 2817   ROSALIND. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and
11 2818     by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot
11 2819     of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will
11 2820     think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow
11 2821     lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may
11 2822     be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful. Therefore
11 2823     beware my censure, and keep your promise.
11 2824 
11 2825   ORLANDO. With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
11 2826     Rosalind; so, adieu.
11 2827 
11 2828   ROSALIND. Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
11 2829     offenders, and let Time try. Adieu.             Exit ORLANDO
11 2830 
11 2831   CELIA. You have simply misus'd our sex in your love-prate. We must
11 2832     have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head, and show the
11 2833     world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
11 2834 
11 2835   ROSALIND. O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst
11 2836     know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded;
11 2837     my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the Bay of Portugal.
11 2838 
11 2839   CELIA. Or rather, bottomless; that as fast as you pour affection
11 2840     in, it runs out.
11 2841 
11 2842   ROSALIND. No; that same wicked bastard of Venus, that was begot of
11 2843     thought, conceiv'd of spleen, and born of madness; that blind
11 2844     rascally boy, that abuses every one's eyes, because his own are
11 2845     out- let him be judge how deep I am in love. I'll tell thee,
11 2846     Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando. I'll go find a
11 2847     shadow, and sigh till he come.
11 2848 
11 2849   CELIA. And I'll sleep.                                  Exeunt
11 2850 
11 2851 
11 2852 SCENE II.
11 2853 
11 2854 The forest
11 2855 
11 2856         Enter JAQUES and LORDS, in the habit of foresters
11 2857 
11 2858 
11 2859   JAQUES. Which is he that killed the deer?
11 2860 
11 2861   LORD. Sir, it was I.
11 2862 
11 2863   JAQUES. Let's present him to the Duke, like a Roman conqueror; and
11 2864     it would do well to set the deer's horns upon his head for a
11 2865     branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?
11 2866 
11 2867   LORD. Yes, sir.
11 2868 
11 2869   JAQUES. Sing it; 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise
11 2870     enough.
11 2871 
11 2872                     SONG.
11 2873 
11 2874       What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
11 2875       His leather skin and horns to wear.
11 2876                               [The rest shall hear this burden:]
11 2877            Then sing him home.
11 2878 
11 2879       Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
11 2880       It was a crest ere thou wast born.
11 2881            Thy father's father wore it;
11 2882            And thy father bore it.
11 2883       The horn, the horn, the lusty horn,
11 2884       Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.                   Exeunt
11 2885 
11 2886 
11 2887 SCENE III.
11 2888 
11 2889 The forest
11 2890 
11 2891 Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
11 2892 
11 2893 
11 2894   ROSALIND. How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock?
11 2895     And here much Orlando!
11 2896 
11 2897   CELIA. I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath
11 2898     ta'en his bow and arrows, and is gone forth- to sleep. Look, who
11 2899     comes here.
11 2900 
11 2901                       Enter SILVIUS
11 2902 
11 2903 
11 2904   SILVIUS. My errand is to you, fair youth;
11 2905     My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
11 2906     I know not the contents; but, as I guess
11 2907     By the stern brow and waspish action
11 2908     Which she did use as she was writing of it,
11 2909     It bears an angry tenour. Pardon me,
11 2910     I am but as a guiltless messenger.
11 2911 
11 2912   ROSALIND. Patience herself would startle at this letter,
11 2913     And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
11 2914     She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
11 2915     She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
11 2916     Were man as rare as Phoenix. 'Od's my will!
11 2917     Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
11 2918     Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
11 2919     This is a letter of your own device.
11 2920 
11 2921   SILVIUS. No, I protest, I know not the contents;
11 2922     Phebe did write it.
11 2923 
11 2924   ROSALIND. Come, come, you are a fool,
11 2925     And turn'd into the extremity of love.
11 2926     I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,
11 2927     A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
11 2928     That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;
11 2929     She has a huswife's hand- but that's no matter.
11 2930     I say she never did invent this letter:
11 2931     This is a man's invention, and his hand.
11 2932 
11 2933   SILVIUS. Sure, it is hers.
11 2934 
11 2935   ROSALIND. Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style;
11 2936     A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
11 2937     Like Turk to Christian. Women's gentle brain
11 2938     Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
11 2939     Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
11 2940     Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
11 2941 
11 2942   SILVIUS. So please you, for I never heard it yet;
11 2943     Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
11 2944 
11 2945   ROSALIND. She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
11 2946                                                          [Reads]
11 2947 
11 2948             'Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
11 2949             That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?'
11 2950 
11 2951     Can a woman rail thus?
11 2952 
11 2953   SILVIUS. Call you this railing?
11 2954 
11 2955   ROSALIND. 'Why, thy godhead laid apart,
11 2956              Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?'
11 2957 
11 2958     Did you ever hear such railing?
11 2959 
11 2960             'Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
11 2961             That could do no vengeance to me.'
11 2962 
11 2963     Meaning me a beast.
11 2964 
11 2965             'If the scorn of your bright eyne
11 2966             Have power to raise such love in mine,
11 2967             Alack, in me what strange effect
11 2968             Would they work in mild aspect!
11 2969             Whiles you chid me, I did love;
11 2970             How then might your prayers move!
11 2971             He that brings this love to the
11 2972             Little knows this love in me;
11 2973             And by him seal up thy mind,
11 2974             Whether that thy youth and kind
11 2975             Will the faithful offer take
11 2976             Of me and all that I can make;
11 2977             Or else by him my love deny,
11 2978             And then I'll study how to die.'
11 2979 
11 2980   SILVIUS. Call you this chiding?
11 2981 
11 2982   CELIA. Alas, poor shepherd!
11 2983 
11 2984   ROSALIND. Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love
11 2985     such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false
11 2986     strains upon thee! Not to be endur'd! Well, go your way to her,
11 2987     for I see love hath made thee tame snake, and say this to her-
11 2988     that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not,
11 2989     I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a
11 2990     true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.
11 2991                                                     Exit SILVIUS
11 2992 
11 2993                          Enter OLIVER
11 2994 
11 2995 
11 2996   OLIVER. Good morrow, fair ones; pray you, if you know,
11 2997     Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
11 2998     A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
11 2999 
11 3000   CELIA. West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom.
11 3001     The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
11 3002     Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
11 3003     But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
11 3004     There's none within.
11 3005 
11 3006   OLIVER. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
11 3007     Then should I know you by description-
11 3008     Such garments, and such years: 'The boy is fair,
11 3009     Of female favour, and bestows himself
11 3010     Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
11 3011     And browner than her brother.' Are not you
11 3012     The owner of the house I did inquire for?
11 3013 
11 3014   CELIA. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
11 3015 
11 3016   OLIVER. Orlando doth commend him to you both;
11 3017     And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
11 3018     He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
11 3019 
11 3020   ROSALIND. I am. What must we understand by this?
11 3021 
11 3022   OLIVER. Some of my shame; if you will know of me
11 3023     What man I am, and how, and why, and where,
11 3024     This handkercher was stain'd.
11 3025 
11 3026   CELIA. I pray you, tell it.
11 3027 
11 3028   OLIVER. When last the young Orlando parted from you,
11 3029     He left a promise to return again
11 3030     Within an hour; and, pacing through the forest,
11 3031     Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
11 3032     Lo, what befell! He threw his eye aside,
11 3033     And mark what object did present itself.
11 3034     Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
11 3035     And high top bald with dry antiquity,
11 3036     A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
11 3037     Lay sleeping on his back. About his neck
11 3038     A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
11 3039     Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
11 3040     The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
11 3041     Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
11 3042     And with indented glides did slip away
11 3043     Into a bush; under which bush's shade
11 3044     A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
11 3045     Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
11 3046     When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
11 3047     The royal disposition of that beast
11 3048     To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
11 3049     This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
11 3050     And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
11 3051 
11 3052   CELIA. O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
11 3053     And he did render him the most unnatural
11 3054     That liv'd amongst men.
11 3055 
11 3056   OLIVER. And well he might so do,
11 3057     For well I know he was unnatural.
11 3058 
11 3059   ROSALIND. But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
11 3060     Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
11 3061 
11 3062   OLIVER. Twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
11 3063     But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
11 3064     And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
11 3065     Made him give battle to the lioness,
11 3066     Who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
11 3067     From miserable slumber I awak'd.
11 3068 
11 3069   CELIA. Are you his brother?
11 3070 
11 3071   ROSALIND. Was't you he rescu'd?
11 3072 
11 3073   CELIA. Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
11 3074 
11 3075   OLIVER. 'Twas I; but 'tis not I. I do not shame
11 3076     To tell you what I was, since my conversion
11 3077     So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
11 3078 
11 3079   ROSALIND. But for the bloody napkin?
11 3080 
11 3081   OLIVER. By and by.
11 3082     When from the first to last, betwixt us two,
11 3083     Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd,
11 3084     As how I came into that desert place-
11 3085     In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
11 3086     Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
11 3087     Committing me unto my brother's love;
11 3088     Who led me instantly unto his cave,
11 3089     There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
11 3090     The lioness had torn some flesh away,
11 3091     Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
11 3092     And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
11 3093     Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound,
11 3094     And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
11 3095     He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
11 3096     To tell this story, that you might excuse
11 3097     His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
11 3098     Dy'd in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
11 3099     That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
11 3100                                                [ROSALIND swoons]
11 3101 
11 3102   CELIA. Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
11 3103 
11 3104   OLIVER. Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
11 3105 
11 3106   CELIA. There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
11 3107 
11 3108   OLIVER. Look, he recovers.
11 3109 
11 3110   ROSALIND. I would I were at home.
11 3111 
11 3112   CELIA. We'll lead you thither.
11 3113     I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
11 3114 
11 3115   OLIVER. Be of good cheer, youth. You a man!
11 3116     You lack a man's heart.
11 3117 
11 3118   ROSALIND. I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think
11 3119     this was well counterfeited. I pray you tell your brother how
11 3120     well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
11 3121 
11 3122   OLIVER. This was not counterfeit; there is too great testimony in
11 3123     your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.
11 3124 
11 3125   ROSALIND. Counterfeit, I assure you.
11 3126 
11 3127   OLIVER. Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
11 3128 
11 3129   ROSALIND. So I do; but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by
11 3130     right.
11 3131 
11 3132   CELIA. Come, you look paler and paler; pray you draw homewards.
11 3133     Good sir, go with us.
11 3134 
11 3135   OLIVER. That will I, for I must bear answer back
11 3136     How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
11 3137 
11 3138   ROSALIND. I shall devise something; but, I pray you, commend my
11 3139     counterfeiting to him. Will you go?                   Exeunt

11 3154 ACT V. SCENE I.
11 3155 
11 3156 The forest
11 3157 
11 3158 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
11 3159 
11 3160 
11 3161   TOUCHSTONE. We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
11 3162 
11 3163   AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
11 3164     gentleman's saying.
11 3165 
11 3166   TOUCHSTONE. A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext.
11 3167     But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to
11 3168     you.
11 3169 
11 3170   AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the
11 3171     world; here comes the man you mean.
11 3172 
11 3173                          Enter WILLIAM
11 3174 
11 3175 
11 3176   TOUCHSTONE. It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth,
11 3177     we that have good wits have much to answer for: we shall be
11 3178     flouting; we cannot hold.
11 3179 
11 3180   WILLIAM. Good ev'n, Audrey.
11 3181 
11 3182   AUDREY. God ye good ev'n, William.
11 3183 
11 3184   WILLIAM. And good ev'n to you, sir.
11 3185 
11 3186   TOUCHSTONE. Good ev'n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
11 3187     head; nay, prithee be cover'd. How old are you, friend?
11 3188 
11 3189   WILLIAM. Five and twenty, sir.
11 3190 
11 3191   TOUCHSTONE. A ripe age. Is thy name William?
11 3192 
11 3193   WILLIAM. William, sir.
11 3194 
11 3195   TOUCHSTONE. A fair name. Wast born i' th' forest here?
11 3196 
11 3197   WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I thank God.
11 3198 
11 3199   TOUCHSTONE. 'Thank God.' A good answer.
11 3200     Art rich?
11 3201 
11 3202   WILLIAM. Faith, sir, so so.
11 3203 
11 3204   TOUCHSTONE. 'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
11 3205     yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
11 3206 
11 3207   WILLIAM. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
11 3208 
11 3209   TOUCHSTONE. Why, thou say'st well. I do now remember a saying:
11 3210 'The
11 3211     fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be
11 3212     a fool.' The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a
11 3213     grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning
11 3214     thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do
11 3215     love this maid?
11 3216 
11 3217   WILLIAM. I do, sir.
11 3218 
11 3219   TOUCHSTONE. Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
11 3220 
11 3221   WILLIAM. No, sir.
11 3222 
11 3223   TOUCHSTONE. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a
11 3224     figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour'd out of cup into a
11 3225     glass, by filling the one doth empty the other; for all your
11 3226     writers do consent that ipse is he; now, you are not ipse, for I
11 3227     am he.
11 3228 
11 3229   WILLIAM. Which he, sir?
11 3230 
11 3231   TOUCHSTONE. He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
11 3232     clown, abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society-which
11 3233     in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is
11 3234     woman- which together is: abandon the society of this female; or,
11 3235     clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better understanding, diest;
11 3236     or, to wit, I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into
11 3237     death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee,
11 3238     or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction;
11 3239     will o'er-run thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and
11 3240     fifty ways; therefore tremble and depart.
11 3241 
11 3242   AUDREY. Do, good William.
11 3243 
11 3244   WILLIAM. God rest you merry, sir.                         Exit
11 3245 
11 3246 
11 3247                           Enter CORIN
11 3248 
11 3249 
11 3250   CORIN. Our master and mistress seeks you; come away, away.
11 3251 
11 3252   TOUCHSTONE. Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey. I attend, I attend.
11 3253                                                           Exeunt
11 3254 
11 3255 
11 3256 SCENE II.
11 3257 
11 3258 The forest
11 3259 
11 3260 Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER
11 3261 
11 3262 
11 3263   ORLANDO. Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should
11 3264     like her? that but seeing you should love her? and loving woo?
11 3265     and, wooing, she should grant? and will you persever to enjoy
11 3266     her?
11 3267 
11 3268   OLIVER. Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the poverty
11 3269     of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden wooing, nor her sudden
11 3270     consenting; but say with me, I love Aliena; say with her that she
11 3271     loves me; consent with both that we may enjoy each other. It
11 3272     shall be to your good; for my father's house and all the revenue
11 3273     that was old Sir Rowland's will I estate upon you, and here live
11 3274     and die a shepherd.
11 3275 
11 3276   ORLANDO. You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow.
11 3277     Thither will I invite the Duke and all's contented followers.
11 3278     Go you and prepare Aliena; for, look you, here comes my Rosalind.
11 3279 
11 3280                         Enter ROSALIND
11 3281 
11 3282 
11 3283   ROSALIND. God save you, brother.
11 3284 
11 3285   OLIVER. And you, fair sister.                             Exit
11 3286 
11 3287   ROSALIND. O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee wear
11 3288     thy heart in a scarf!
11 3289 
11 3290   ORLANDO. It is my arm.
11 3291 
11 3292   ROSALIND. I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
11 3293     lion.
11 3294 
11 3295   ORLANDO. Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
11 3296 
11 3297   ROSALIND. Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
11 3298     when he show'd me your handkercher?
11 3299 
11 3300   ORLANDO. Ay, and greater wonders than that.
11 3301 
11 3302   ROSALIND. O, I know where you are. Nay, 'tis true. There was never
11 3303     any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar's
11 3304     thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and overcame.' For your brother
11 3305     and my sister no sooner met but they look'd; no sooner look'd but
11 3306     they lov'd; no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd; no sooner sigh'd but
11 3307     they ask'd one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but
11 3308     they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair
11 3309     of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else
11 3310     be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of
11 3311 
11 3312 
11 3313     love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.
11 3314 
11 3315   ORLANDO. They shall be married to-morrow; and I will bid the Duke
11 3316     to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it is to look into
11 3317     happiness through another man's eyes! By so much the more shall I
11 3318     to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I
11 3319     shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
11 3320 
11 3321   ROSALIND. Why, then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
11 3322     Rosalind?
11 3323 
11 3324   ORLANDO. I can live no longer by thinking.
11 3325 
11 3326   ROSALIND. I will weary you, then, no longer with idle talking.
11 3327     Know of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are
11 3328     a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should
11 3329     bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you
11 3330     are; neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some
11 3331     little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and
11 3332     not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do
11 3333     strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers'd
11 3334     with a magician, most profound in his art and yet not damnable.
11 3335     If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries
11 3336     it out, when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her.
11 3337     I know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not
11 3338     impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set
11 3339     her before your eyes to-morrow, human as she is, and without any
11 3340     danger.
11 3341 
11 3342   ORLANDO. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?
11 3343 
11 3344   ROSALIND. By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I say I
11 3345     am a magician. Therefore put you in your best array, bid your
11 3346     friends; for if you will be married to-morrow, you shall; and to
11 3347     Rosalind, if you will.
11 3348 
11 3349                      Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
11 3350 
11 3351     Look, here comes a lover of mine, and a lover of hers.
11 3352 
11 3353   PHEBE. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness
11 3354     To show the letter that I writ to you.
11 3355 
11 3356   ROSALIND. I care not if I have. It is my study
11 3357     To seem despiteful and ungentle to you.
11 3358     You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd;
11 3359     Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
11 3360 
11 3361   PHEBE. Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
11 3362 
11 3363   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
11 3364     And so am I for Phebe.
11 3365 
11 3366   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
11 3367 
11 3368   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
11 3369 
11 3370   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
11 3371 
11 3372   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of faith and service;
11 3373     And so am I for Phebe.
11 3374 
11 3375   PHEBE. And I for Ganymede.
11 3376 
11 3377   ORLANDO. And I for Rosalind.
11 3378 
11 3379   ROSALIND. And I for no woman.
11 3380 
11 3381   SILVIUS. It is to be all made of fantasy,
11 3382     All made of passion, and all made of wishes;
11 3383     All adoration, duty, and observance,
11 3384     All humbleness, all patience, and impatience,
11 3385     All purity, all trial, all obedience;
11 3386     And so am I for Phebe.
11 3387 
11 3388   PHEBE. And so am I for Ganymede.
11 3389 
11 3390   ORLANDO. And so am I for Rosalind.
11 3391 
11 3392   ROSALIND. And so am I for no woman.
11 3393 
11 3394   PHEBE. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
11 3395 
11 3396   SILVIUS. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
11 3397 
11 3398   ORLANDO. If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
11 3399 
11 3400   ROSALIND. Why do you speak too, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
11 3401 
11 3402   ORLANDO. To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
11 3403 
11 3404   ROSALIND. Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish
11 3405     wolves against the moon. [To SILVIUS] I will help you if I can.
11 3406     [To PHEBE] I would love you if I could.- To-morrow meet me all
11 3407     together. [ To PHEBE ] I will marry you if ever I marry woman,
11 3408     and I'll be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] I will satisfy you if
11 3409     ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow. [To
11 3410     Silvius] I will content you if what pleases you contents you, and
11 3411     you shall be married to-morrow. [To ORLANDO] As you love
11 3412     Rosalind, meet. [To SILVIUS] As you love Phebe, meet;- and as I
11 3413     love no woman, I'll meet. So, fare you well; I have left you
11 3414     commands.
11 3415 
11 3416   SILVIUS. I'll not fail, if I live.
11 3417 
11 3418   PHEBE. Nor I.
11 3419 
11 3420   ORLANDO. Nor I.                                         Exeunt

11 3423 SCENE III.
11 3424 
11 3425 The forest
11 3426 
11 3427 Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
11 3428 
11 3429 
11 3430   TOUCHSTONE. To-morrow is the joyful day, Audre'y; to-morrow will we
11 3431     be married.
11 3432 
11 3433   AUDREY. I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no
11 3434     dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come
11 3435     two of the banish'd Duke's pages.
11 3436 
11 3437                             Enter two PAGES
11 3438 
11 3439 
11 3440   FIRST PAGE. Well met, honest gentleman.
11 3441 
11 3442   TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.
11 3443 
11 3444   SECOND PAGE. We are for you; sit i' th' middle.
11 3445 
11 3446   FIRST PAGE. Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or
11 3447     spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues
11 3448     to a bad voice?
11 3449 
11 3450   SECOND PAGE. I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies
11 3451     on a horse.
11 3452 
11 3453                       SONG.
11 3454         It was a lover and his lass,
11 3455           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
11 3456         That o'er the green corn-field did pass
11 3457           In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
11 3458         When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.
11 3459         Sweet lovers love the spring.
11 3460 
11 3461         Between the acres of the rye,
11 3462           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
11 3463         These pretty country folks would lie,
11 3464           In the spring time, &c.
11 3465 
11 3466         This carol they began that hour,
11 3467           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
11 3468         How that a life was but a flower,
11 3469           In the spring time, &c.
11 3470 
11 3471         And therefore take the present time,
11 3472           With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
11 3473         For love is crowned with the prime,
11 3474           In the spring time, &c.
11 3475 
11 3476 
11 3477   TOUCHSTONE. Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
11 3478     matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.
11 3479 
11 3480   FIRST PAGE. YOU are deceiv'd, sir; we kept time, we lost not our
11 3481     time.
11 3482 
11 3483   TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such
11 3484     a foolish song. God buy you; and God mend your voices. Come,
11 3485     Audrey.                                               Exeunt

11 3488 SCENE IV.
11 3489 
11 3490 The forest
11 3491 
11 3492 Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA
11 3493 
11 3494 
11 3495   DUKE SENIOR. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
11 3496     Can do all this that he hath promised?
11 3497 
11 3498   ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not:
11 3499     As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
11 3500 
11 3501                Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE
11 3502 
11 3503 
11 3504   ROSALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd:
11 3505     You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
11 3506     You will bestow her on Orlando here?
11 3507 
11 3508   DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
11 3509 
11 3510   ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?
11 3511 
11 3512   ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
11 3513 
11 3514   ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?
11 3515 
11 3516   PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.
11 3517 
11 3518   ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me,
11 3519     You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
11 3520 
11 3521   PHEBE. So is the bargain.
11 3522 
11 3523   ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
11 3524 
11 3525   SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.
11 3526 
11 3527   ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even.
11 3528     Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;
11 3529     You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;
11 3530     Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
11 3531     Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;
11 3532     Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her
11 3533     If she refuse me; and from hence I go,
11 3534     To make these doubts all even.
11 3535                                        Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
11 3536 
11 3537   DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy
11 3538     Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
11 3539 
11 3540   ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
11 3541     Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
11 3542     But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
11 3543     And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
11 3544     Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
11 3545     Whom he reports to be a great magician,
11 3546     Obscured in the circle of this forest.
11 3547 
11 3548                     Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
11 3549 
11 3550 
11 3551   JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are
11 3552     coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which
11 3553     in all tongues are call'd fools.
11 3554 
11 3555   TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!
11 3556 
11 3557   JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded
11 3558     gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a
11 3559     courtier, he swears.
11 3560 
11 3561   TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
11 3562     I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been
11 3563     politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone
11 3564     three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought
11 3565     one.
11 3566 
11 3567   JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?
11 3568 
11 3569   TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
11 3570     seventh cause.
11 3571 
11 3572   JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
11 3573 
11 3574   DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.
11 3575 
11 3576   TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in
11 3577     here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear
11 3578     and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A
11 3579     poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a
11 3580     poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will.
11 3581     Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl
11 3582     in your foul oyster.
11 3583 
11 3584   DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
11 3585 
11 3586   TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
11 3587     diseases.
11 3588 
11 3589   JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
11 3590     the seventh cause?
11 3591 
11 3592   TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
11 3593     seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain
11 3594     courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not
11 3595     cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort
11 3596     Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would
11 3597     send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip
11 3598     Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.
11 3599     This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut,
11 3600     he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof
11 3601     Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie.
11 3602     This is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie
11 3603     Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
11 3604 
11 3605   JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
11 3606 
11 3607   TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor
11 3608     he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords
11 3609     and parted.
11 3610 
11 3611   JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
11 3612 
11 3613   TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
11 3614     books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first,
11 3615     the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the
11 3616     Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
11 3617     Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance;
11 3618     the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie
11 3619     Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven
11 3620     justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were
11 3621     met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you
11 3622     said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore
11 3623     brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.
11 3624 
11 3625   JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?
11 3626     He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.
11 3627 
11 3628   DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the
11 3629     presentation of that he shoots his wit:
11 3630 
11 3631           Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC
11 3632 
11 3633     HYMEN.    Then is there mirth in heaven,
11 3634               When earthly things made even
11 3635                 Atone together.
11 3636               Good Duke, receive thy daughter;
11 3637               Hymen from heaven brought her,
11 3638                 Yea, brought her hither,
11 3639               That thou mightst join her hand with his,
11 3640               Whose heart within his bosom is.
11 3641 
11 3642   ROSALIND. [To DUKE] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
11 3643     [To ORLANDO] To you I give myself, for I am yours.
11 3644 
11 3645   DUKE SENIOR. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
11 3646 
11 3647   ORLANDO. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
11 3648 
11 3649   PHEBE. If sight and shape be true,
11 3650     Why then, my love adieu!
11 3651 
11 3652   ROSALIND. I'll have no father, if you be not he;
11 3653     I'll have no husband, if you be not he;
11 3654     Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
11 3655 
11 3656   HYMEN.    Peace, ho! I bar confusion;
11 3657             'Tis I must make conclusion
11 3658               Of these most strange events.
11 3659             Here's eight that must take hands
11 3660             To join in Hymen's bands,
11 3661               If truth holds true contents.
11 3662             You and you no cross shall part;
11 3663             You and you are heart in heart;
11 3664             You to his love must accord,
11 3665             Or have a woman to your lord;
11 3666             You and you are sure together,
11 3667             As the winter to foul weather.
11 3668             Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
11 3669             Feed yourselves with questioning,
11 3670             That reason wonder may diminish,
11 3671             How thus we met, and these things finish.
11 3672 
11 3673                        SONG
11 3674             Wedding is great Juno's crown;
11 3675               O blessed bond of board and bed!
11 3676             'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
11 3677               High wedlock then be honoured.
11 3678             Honour, high honour, and renown,
11 3679             To Hymen, god of every town!
11 3680 
11 3681 
11 3682   DUKE SENIOR. O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
11 3683     Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
11 3684 
11 3685   PHEBE. I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
11 3686     Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
11 3687 
11 3688                  Enter JAQUES de BOYS
11 3689 
11 3690 
11 3691   JAQUES de BOYS. Let me have audience for a word or two.
11 3692     I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
11 3693     That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
11 3694     Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
11 3695     Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
11 3696     Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
11 3697     In his own conduct, purposely to take
11 3698     His brother here, and put him to the sword;
11 3699     And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
11 3700     Where, meeting with an old religious man,
11 3701     After some question with him, was converted
11 3702     Both from his enterprise and from the world;
11 3703     His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
11 3704     And all their lands restor'd to them again
11 3705     That were with him exil'd. This to be true
11 3706     I do engage my life.
11 3707 
11 3708   DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man.
11 3709     Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
11 3710     To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,
11 3711     A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
11 3712     First, in this forest let us do those ends
11 3713     That here were well begun and well begot;
11 3714     And after, every of this happy number,
11 3715     That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,
11 3716     Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
11 3717     According to the measure of their states.
11 3718     Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,
11 3719     And fall into our rustic revelry.
11 3720     Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,
11 3721     With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.
11 3722 
11 3723   JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
11 3724     The Duke hath put on a religious life,
11 3725     And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
11 3726 
11 3727   JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.
11 3728 
11 3729   JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites
11 3730     There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
11 3731     [To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath;
11 3732     Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.
11 3733     [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit;
11 3734     [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies
11 3735     [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed;
11 3736     [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
11 3737     Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;
11 3738     I am for other than for dancing measures.
11 3739 
11 3740   DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.
11 3741 
11 3742   JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you would have
11 3743     I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.               Exit
11 3744 
11 3745   DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites,
11 3746     As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.    [A dance]
11 3747 
11 3748 Exeunt
11 3749 
11 3750 EPILOGUE
11 3751                            EPILOGUE.
11 3752 
11 3753   ROSALIND. It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but
11 3754     it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue.
11 3755     If it be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play
11 3756     needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and
11 3757     good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues.
11 3758     What a case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot
11 3759     insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
11 3760     furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me.
11 3761     My way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge
11 3762     you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of
11 3763     this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love
11 3764     you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you
11 3765     hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.
11 3766     If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that
11 3767     pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied
11 3768     not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,
11 3769     or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,
11 3770     bid me farewell.

11 3814 Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

11 3817 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
11 3818 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
11 3819 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
11 3820 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
11 3821 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you

11 3834 
11 3835 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
11 3836 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
11 3837 
11 3838 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
11 3839 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
11 3840 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
11 3841 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
11 3842 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
11 3843 http://gutenberg.org/license).
11 3844 
11 3845 
11 3846 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
11 3847 electronic works
11 3848 
11 3849 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
11 3850 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
11 3851 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
11 3852 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
11 3853 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
11 3854 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
11 3855 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
11 3856 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
11 3857 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
11 3858 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
11 3859 
11 3860 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
11 3861 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
11 3862 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
11 3863 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
11 3864 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
11 3865 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
11 3866 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
11 3867 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
11 3868 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
11 3869 
11 3870 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
11 3871 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
11 3872 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
11 3873 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
11 3874 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
11 3875 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
11 3876 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
11 3877 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
11 3878 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
11 3879 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
11 3880 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
11 3881 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
11 3882 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
11 3883 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
11 3884 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
11 3885 
11 3886 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
11 3887 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
11 3888 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
11 3889 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
11 3890 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
11 3891 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
11 3892 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
11 3893 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
11 3894 States.
11 3895 
11 3896 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
11 3897 
11 3898 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
11 3899 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
11 3900 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
11 3901 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
11 3902 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
11 3903 copied or distributed:
11 3904 
11 3905 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
11 3906 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
11 3907 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
11 3908 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
11 3909 
11 3910 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
11 3911 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
11 3912 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
11 3913 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
11 3914 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
11 3915 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
11 3916 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
11 3917 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
11 3918 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
11 3919 1.E.9.
11 3920 
11 3921 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
11 3922 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
11 3923 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
11 3924 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
11 3925 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
11 3926 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
11 3927 
11 3928 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
11 3929 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
11 3930 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
11 3931 
11 3932 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
11 3933 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
11 3934 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
11 3935 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
11 3936 Gutenberg-tm License.
11 3937 
11 3938 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
11 3939 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
11 3940 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
11 3941 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
11 3942 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
11 3943 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
11 3944 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
11 3945 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
11 3946 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
11 3947 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
11 3948 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
11 3949 
11 3950 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
11 3951 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
11 3952 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
11 3953 
11 3954 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
11 3955 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
11 3956 that
11 3957 
11 3958 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
11 3959      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
11 3960      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
11 3961      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
11 3962      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
11 3963      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
11 3964      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
11 3965      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
11 3966      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
11 3967      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
11 3968      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
11 3969      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

11 3971 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
11 3972      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
11 3973      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
11 3974      License.  You must require such a user to return or
11 3975      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
11 3976      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
11 3977      Project Gutenberg-tm works.
11 3978 
11 3979 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
11 3980      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
11 3981      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
11 3982      of receipt of the work.
11 3983 
11 3984 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
11 3985      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

11 3988 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
11 3989 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
11 3990 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
11 3991 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

11 3993 
11 3994 1.F.
11 3995 
11 3996 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
11 3997 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
11 3998 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
11 3999 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
11 4000 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
11 4001 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
11 4002 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
11 4003 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
11 4004 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
11 4005 your equipment.
11 4006 
11 4007 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
11 4008 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
11 4009 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
11 4010 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
11 4011 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
11 4012 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
11 4013 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
11 4014 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
11 4015 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
11 4016 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
11 4017 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
11 4018 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
11 4019 DAMAGE.
11 4020 
11 4021 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
11 4022 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
11 4023 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
11 4024 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
11 4025 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
11 4026 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
11 4027 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
11 4028 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
11 4029 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
11 4030 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
11 4031 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
11 4032 opportunities to fix the problem.
11 4033 
11 4034 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
11 4035 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
11 4036 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
11 4037 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
11 4038 
11 4039 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
11 4040 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
11 4041 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
11 4042 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
11 4043 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
11 4044 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
11 4045 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
11 4046 
11 4047 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
11 4048 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
11 4049 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
11 4050 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
11 4051 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
11 4052 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
11 4053 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
11 4054 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
11 4055 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
11 4056 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
11 4057 
11 4058 
11 4059 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
11 4060 
11 4061 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
11 4062 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
11 4063 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
11 4064 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
11 4065 people in all walks of life.
11 4066 
11 4067 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
11 4068 assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
11 4069 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
11 4070 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
11 4071 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

11 4104 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
11 4105 Literary Archive Foundation
11 4106 
11 4107 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
11 4108 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
11 4109 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
11 4110 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
11 4111 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
11 4112 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
11 4113 status with the IRS.
11 4114 
11 4115 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
11 4116 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
11 4117 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
11 4118 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
11 4119 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
11 4120 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
11 4121 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
11 4122 particular state visit http://pglaf.org
11 4123 
11 4124 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
11 4125 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
11 4126 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
11 4127 approach us with offers to donate.
11 4128 
11 4129 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
11 4130 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
11 4131 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
11 4132 
11 4133 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
11 4134 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
11 4135 ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

11 4139 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
11 4140 works.
11 4141 
11 4142 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
11 4143 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
11 4144 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
11 4145 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
11 4146 
11 4147 
11 4148 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
11 4149 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
11 4150 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
11 4151 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
