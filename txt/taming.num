12 49                       INDUCTION. SCENE I.
12 50                   Before an alehouse on a heath
12 51 
12 52                       Enter HOSTESS and SLY
12 53 
12 54   SLY. I'll pheeze you, in faith.
12 55   HOSTESS. A pair of stocks, you rogue!
12 56   SLY. Y'are a baggage; the Slys are no rogues. Look in the
12 57     chronicles: we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore,
12 58 paucas
12 59     pallabris; let the world slide. Sessa!
12 60   HOSTESS. You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
12 61   SLY. No, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold
12 62 bed
12 63     and warm thee.
12 64   HOSTESS. I know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.
12 65  Exit
12 66   SLY. Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him by
12 67 law.
12 68     I'll not budge an inch, boy; let him come, and kindly.
12 69                                                   [Falls asleep]
12 70 
12 71        Wind horns. Enter a LORD from hunting, with his train
12 72 
12 73   LORD. Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds; 
12 74     Brach Merriman, the poor cur, is emboss'd;
12 75     And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
12 76     Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
12 77     At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?
12 78     I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
12 79   FIRST HUNTSMAN. Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
12 80     He cried upon it at the merest loss,
12 81     And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent;
12 82     Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
12 83   LORD. Thou art a fool; if Echo were as fleet,
12 84     I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
12 85     But sup them well, and look unto them all;
12 86     To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
12 87   FIRST HUNTSMAN. I will, my lord.
12 88   LORD. What's here? One dead, or drunk?
12 89     See, doth he breathe?
12 90   SECOND HUNTSMAN. He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with
12 91 ale,
12 92     This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
12 93   LORD. O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
12 94     Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image! 
12 95     Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
12 96     What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
12 97     Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
12 98     A most delicious banquet by his bed,
12 99     And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
12 100     Would not the beggar then forget himself?
12 101   FIRST HUNTSMAN. Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
12 102   SECOND HUNTSMAN. It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd.
12 103   LORD. Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.
12 104     Then take him up, and manage well the jest:
12 105     Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
12 106     And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
12 107     Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
12 108     And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
12 109     Procure me music ready when he wakes,
12 110     To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
12 111     And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
12 112     And with a low submissive reverence
12 113     Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
12 114     Let one attend him with a silver basin 
12 115     Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;
12 116     Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
12 117     And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
12 118     Some one be ready with a costly suit,
12 119     And ask him what apparel he will wear;
12 120     Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
12 121     And that his lady mourns at his disease;
12 122     Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
12 123     And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,
12 124     For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
12 125     This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
12 126     It will be pastime passing excellent,
12 127     If it be husbanded with modesty.
12 128   FIRST HUNTSMAN. My lord, I warrant you we will play our part
12 129     As he shall think by our true diligence
12 130     He is no less than what we say he is.
12 131   LORD. Take him up gently, and to bed with him;
12 132     And each one to his office when he wakes.
12 133                           [SLY is carried out. A trumpet sounds]
12 134     Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds- 
12 135                                                     Exit SERVANT
12 136     Belike some noble gentleman that means,
12 137     Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
12 138 
12 139                          Re-enter a SERVINGMAN
12 140 
12 141     How now! who is it?
12 142   SERVANT. An't please your honour, players
12 143     That offer service to your lordship.
12 144   LORD. Bid them come near.
12 145 
12 146                              Enter PLAYERS
12 147 
12 148     Now, fellows, you are welcome.
12 149   PLAYERS. We thank your honour.
12 150   LORD. Do you intend to stay with me to-night?
12 151   PLAYER. So please your lordship to accept our duty.
12 152   LORD. With all my heart. This fellow I remember
12 153     Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son;
12 154     'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well. 
12 155     I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
12 156     Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
12 157   PLAYER. I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
12 158   LORD. 'Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.
12 159     Well, you are come to me in happy time,
12 160     The rather for I have some sport in hand
12 161     Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
12 162     There is a lord will hear you play to-night;
12 163     But I am doubtful of your modesties,
12 164     Lest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,
12 165     For yet his honour never heard a play,
12 166     You break into some merry passion
12 167     And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
12 168     If you should smile, he grows impatient.
12 169   PLAYER. Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,
12 170     Were he the veriest antic in the world.
12 171   LORD. Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
12 172     And give them friendly welcome every one;
12 173     Let them want nothing that my house affords.
12 174                                        Exit one with the PLAYERS 
12 175     Sirrah, go you to Bartholomew my page,
12 176     And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady;
12 177     That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber,
12 178     And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
12 179     Tell him from me- as he will win my love-
12 180     He bear himself with honourable action,
12 181     Such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies
12 182     Unto their lords, by them accomplished;
12 183     Such duty to the drunkard let him do,
12 184     With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
12 185     And say 'What is't your honour will command,
12 186     Wherein your lady and your humble wife
12 187     May show her duty and make known her love?'
12 188     And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
12 189     And with declining head into his bosom,
12 190     Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
12 191     To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
12 192     Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
12 193     No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
12 194     And if the boy have not a woman's gift 
12 195     To rain a shower of commanded tears,
12 196     An onion will do well for such a shift,
12 197     Which, in a napkin being close convey'd,
12 198     Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
12 199     See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst;
12 200     Anon I'll give thee more instructions.     Exit a SERVINGMAN
12 201     I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
12 202     Voice, gait, and action, of a gentlewoman;
12 203     I long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband';
12 204     And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
12 205     When they do homage to this simple peasant.
12 206     I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
12 207     May well abate the over-merry spleen,
12 208     Which otherwise would grow into extremes.             Exeunt
12 209 
12 210 SC_2
12 211                             SCENE II.
12 212                A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
12 213 
12 214     Enter aloft SLY, with ATTENDANTS; some with apparel, basin
12 215              and ewer, and other appurtenances; and LORD
12 216 
12 217   SLY. For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
12 218   FIRST SERVANT. Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
12 219   SECOND SERVANT. Will't please your honour taste of these
12 220 conserves?
12 221   THIRD SERVANT. What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
12 222   SLY. I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
12 223 'lordship.' I
12 224     ne'er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any
12 225 conserves,
12 226     give me conserves of beef. Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll
12 227 wear,
12 228     for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
12 229 than
12 230     legs, nor no more shoes than feet- nay, sometime more feet
12 231 than
12 232     shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.
12 233   LORD. Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
12 234     O, that a mighty man of such descent,
12 235     Of such possessions, and so high esteem,
12 236     Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
12 237   SLY. What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old
12 238     Sly's son of Burton Heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a 
12 239     cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present
12 240     profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of
12 241     Wincot, if she know me not; if she say I am not fourteen
12 242 pence on
12 243     the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lying'st knave
12 244 in
12 245     Christendom. What! I am not bestraught.  [Taking a pot of
12 246 ale]
12 247     Here's-
12 248   THIRD SERVANT. O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
12 249   SECOND SERVANT. O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
12 250   LORD. Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
12 251     As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
12 252     O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!
12 253     Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,
12 254     And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
12 255     Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
12 256     Each in his office ready at thy beck.
12 257     Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays,            [Music]
12 258     And twenty caged nightingales do sing.
12 259     Or wilt thou sleep? We'll have thee to a couch
12 260     Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
12 261     On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis. 
12 262     Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground.
12 263     Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp'd,
12 264     Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
12 265     Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
12 266     Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?
12 267     Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
12 268     And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth.
12 269   FIRST SERVANT. Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as
12 270 swift
12 271     As breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.
12 272   SECOND SERVANT. Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee
12 273       straight
12 274     Adonis painted by a running brook,
12 275     And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
12 276     Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
12 277     Even as the waving sedges play wi' th' wind.
12 278   LORD. We'll show thee lo as she was a maid
12 279     And how she was beguiled and surpris'd,
12 280     As lively painted as the deed was done.
12 281   THIRD SERVANT. Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
12 282     Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds 
12 283     And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
12 284     So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
12 285   LORD. Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord.
12 286     Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
12 287     Than any woman in this waning age.
12 288   FIRST SERVANT. And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee
12 289     Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
12 290     She was the fairest creature in the world;
12 291     And yet she is inferior to none.
12 292   SLY. Am I a lord and have I such a lady?
12 293     Or do I dream? Or have I dream'd till now?
12 294     I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
12 295     I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things.
12 296     Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,
12 297     And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.
12 298     Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
12 299     And once again, a pot o' th' smallest ale.
12 300   SECOND SERVANT. Will't please your Mightiness to wash your
12 301 hands?
12 302     O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
12 303     O, that once more you knew but what you are! 
12 304     These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
12 305     Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.
12 306   SLY. These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
12 307     But did I never speak of all that time?
12 308   FIRST SERVANT. O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;
12 309     For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
12 310     Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
12 311     And rail upon the hostess of the house,
12 312     And say you would present her at the leet,
12 313     Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts.
12 314     Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
12 315   SLY. Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
12 316   THIRD SERVANT. Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
12 317     Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
12 318     As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
12 319     And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;
12 320     And twenty more such names and men as these,
12 321     Which never were, nor no man ever saw.
12 322   SLY. Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!
12 323   ALL. Amen. 
12 324 
12 325            Enter the PAGE as a lady, with ATTENDANTS
12 326 
12 327   SLY. I thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.
12 328   PAGE. How fares my noble lord?
12 329   SLY. Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.
12 330     Where is my wife?
12 331   PAGE. Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?
12 332   SLY. Are you my wife, and will not call me husband?
12 333     My men should call me 'lord'; I am your goodman.
12 334   PAGE. My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
12 335     I am your wife in all obedience.
12 336   SLY. I know it well. What must I call her?
12 337   LORD. Madam.
12 338   SLY. Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
12 339   LORD. Madam, and nothing else; so lords call ladies.
12 340   SLY. Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
12 341     And slept above some fifteen year or more.
12 342   PAGE. Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
12 343     Being all this time abandon'd from your bed. 
12 344   SLY. 'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
12 345                                                  Exeunt SERVANTS
12 346     Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
12 347   PAGE. Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
12 348     To pardon me yet for a night or two;
12 349     Or, if not so, until the sun be set.
12 350     For your physicians have expressly charg'd,
12 351     In peril to incur your former malady,
12 352     That I should yet absent me from your bed.
12 353     I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
12 354   SLY. Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long. But I
12 355 would
12 356     be loath to fall into my dreams again. I will therefore tarry
12 357 in
12 358     despite of the flesh and the blood.
12 359 
12 360                        Enter a MESSENGER
12 361 
12 362   MESSENGER. Your honour's players, hearing your amendment,
12 363     Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
12 364     For so your doctors hold it very meet,
12 365     Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood, 
12 366     And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.
12 367     Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
12 368     And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
12 369     Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
12 370   SLY. Marry, I will; let them play it. Is not a comonty a
12 371     Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
12 372   PAGE. No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
12 373   SLY. What, household stuff?
12 374   PAGE. It is a kind of history.
12 375   SLY. Well, we'll see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and
12 376 let
12 377     the world slip;-we shall ne'er be younger.
12 378                                                  [They sit down]
12 379 
12 380           A flourish of trumpets announces the play

12 396 ACT I. SCENE I.
12 397 Padua. A public place
12 398 
12 399 Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO
12 400 
12 401   LUCENTIO. Tranio, since for the great desire I had
12 402     To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
12 403     I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,
12 404     The pleasant garden of great Italy,
12 405     And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
12 406     With his good will and thy good company,
12 407     My trusty servant well approv'd in all,
12 408     Here let us breathe, and haply institute
12 409     A course of learning and ingenious studies.
12 410     Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
12 411     Gave me my being and my father first,
12 412     A merchant of great traffic through the world,
12 413     Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;
12 414     Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
12 415     It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,
12 416     To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.
12 417     And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study, 
12 418     Virtue and that part of philosophy
12 419     Will I apply that treats of happiness
12 420     By virtue specially to be achiev'd.
12 421     Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
12 422     And am to Padua come as he that leaves
12 423     A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
12 424     And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
12 425   TRANIO. Mi perdonato, gentle master mine;
12 426     I am in all affected as yourself;
12 427     Glad that you thus continue your resolve
12 428     To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
12 429     Only, good master, while we do admire
12 430     This virtue and this moral discipline,
12 431     Let's be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,
12 432     Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
12 433     As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
12 434     Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
12 435     And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
12 436     Music and poesy use to quicken you;
12 437     The mathematics and the metaphysics, 
12 438     Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.
12 439     No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
12 440     In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
12 441   LUCENTIO. Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
12 442     If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
12 443     We could at once put us in readiness,
12 444     And take a lodging fit to entertain
12 445     Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
12 446 
12 447       Enter BAPTISTA with his two daughters, KATHERINA
12 448         and BIANCA; GREMIO, a pantaloon; HORTENSIO,
12 449         suitor to BIANCA. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by
12 450 
12 451     But stay awhile; what company is this?
12 452   TRANIO. Master, some show to welcome us to town.
12 453   BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
12 454     For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;
12 455     That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
12 456     Before I have a husband for the elder.
12 457     If either of you both love Katherina, 
12 458     Because I know you well and love you well,
12 459     Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
12 460   GREMIO. To cart her rather. She's too rough for me.
12 461     There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?
12 462   KATHERINA.  [To BAPTISTA]  I pray you, sir, is it your will
12 463     To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
12 464   HORTENSIO. Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,
12 465     Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
12 466   KATHERINA. I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;
12 467     Iwis it is not halfway to her heart;
12 468     But if it were, doubt not her care should be
12 469     To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,
12 470     And paint your face, and use you like a fool.
12 471   HORTENSIO. From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
12 472   GREMIO. And me, too, good Lord!
12 473   TRANIO. Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;
12 474     That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
12 475   LUCENTIO. But in the other's silence do I see
12 476     Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.
12 477     Peace, Tranio! 
12 478   TRANIO. Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
12 479   BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
12 480     What I have said- Bianca, get you in;
12 481     And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
12 482     For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
12 483   KATHERINA. A pretty peat! it is best
12 484     Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
12 485   BIANCA. Sister, content you in my discontent.
12 486     Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe;
12 487     My books and instruments shall be my company,
12 488     On them to look, and practise by myself.
12 489   LUCENTIO. Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!
12 490   HORTENSIO. Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
12 491     Sorry am I that our good will effects
12 492     Bianca's grief.
12 493   GREMIO. Why will you mew her up,
12 494     Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
12 495     And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
12 496   BAPTISTA. Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
12 497     Go in, Bianca.                                   Exit BIANCA 
12 498     And for I know she taketh most delight
12 499     In music, instruments, and poetry,
12 500     Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
12 501     Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
12 502     Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
12 503     Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
12 504     I will be very kind, and liberal
12 505     To mine own children in good bringing-up;
12 506     And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;
12 507     For I have more to commune with Bianca.                 Exit
12 508   KATHERINA. Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
12 509     What! shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike,
12 510     I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha!          Exit
12 511   GREMIO. You may go to the devil's dam; your gifts are so good
12 512     here's none will hold you. There! Love is not so great,
12 513     Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it
12 514 fairly
12 515     out; our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell; yet, for the
12 516 love
12 517     I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
12 518 man
12 519     to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to
12 520 her
12 521     father. 
12 522   HORTENSIO. SO Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray.
12 523 Though
12 524     the nature of our quarrel yet never brook'd parle, know now,
12 525 upon
12 526     advice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have
12 527 access to
12 528     our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca's love- to
12 529     labour and effect one thing specially.
12 530   GREMIO. What's that, I pray?
12 531   HORTENSIO. Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
12 532   GREMIO. A husband? a devil.
12 533   HORTENSIO. I say a husband.
12 534   GREMIO. I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her
12 535 father
12 536     be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to
12 537 hell?
12 538   HORTENSIO. Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine
12 539 to
12 540     endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in
12 541 the
12 542     world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all
12 543     faults, and money enough.
12 544   GREMIO. I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
12 545 this
12 546     condition: to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning.
12 547   HORTENSIO. Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
12 548     apples. But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it
12 549     shall be so far forth friendly maintain'd till by helping 
12 550     Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest
12 551 free
12 552     for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy
12 553 man
12 554     be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you,
12 555     Signior Gremio?
12 556   GREMIO. I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse
12 557 in
12 558     Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed
12 559 her,
12 560     and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.
12 561                                      Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
12 562   TRANIO. I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
12 563     That love should of a sudden take such hold?
12 564   LUCENTIO. O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
12 565     I never thought it possible or likely.
12 566     But see! while idly I stood looking on,
12 567     I found the effect of love in idleness;
12 568     And now in plainness do confess to thee,
12 569     That art to me as secret and as dear
12 570     As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was-
12 571     Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
12 572     If I achieve not this young modest girl.
12 573     Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst; 
12 574     Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
12 575   TRANIO. Master, it is no time to chide you now;
12 576     Affection is not rated from the heart;
12 577     If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so:
12 578     'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
12 579   LUCENTIO. Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
12 580     The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
12 581   TRANIO. Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.
12 582     Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
12 583   LUCENTIO. O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
12 584     Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
12 585     That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
12 586     When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
12 587   TRANIO. Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how her sister
12 588     Began to scold and raise up such a storm
12 589     That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
12 590   LUCENTIO. Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,
12 591     And with her breath she did perfume the air;
12 592     Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
12 593   TRANIO. Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance. 
12 594     I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,
12 595     Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
12 596     Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
12 597     That, till the father rid his hands of her,
12 598     Master, your love must live a maid at home;
12 599     And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
12 600     Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
12 601   LUCENTIO. Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
12 602     But art thou not advis'd he took some care
12 603     To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
12 604   TRANIO. Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.
12 605   LUCENTIO. I have it, Tranio.
12 606   TRANIO. Master, for my hand,
12 607     Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
12 608   LUCENTIO. Tell me thine first.
12 609   TRANIO. You will be schoolmaster,
12 610     And undertake the teaching of the maid-
12 611     That's your device.
12 612   LUCENTIO. It is. May it be done?
12 613   TRANIO. Not possible; for who shall bear your part 
12 614     And be in Padua here Vincentio's son;
12 615     Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
12 616     Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
12 617   LUCENTIO. Basta, content thee, for I have it full.
12 618     We have not yet been seen in any house,
12 619     Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
12 620     For man or master. Then it follows thus:
12 621     Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
12 622     Keep house and port and servants, as I should;
12 623     I will some other be- some Florentine,
12 624     Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
12 625     'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
12 626     Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
12 627     When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
12 628     But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
12 629   TRANIO. So had you need.                [They exchange habits]
12 630     In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
12 631     And I am tied to be obedient-
12 632     For so your father charg'd me at our parting:
12 633     'Be serviceable to my son' quoth he, 
12 634     Although I think 'twas in another sense-
12 635     I am content to be Lucentio,
12 636     Because so well I love Lucentio.
12 637   LUCENTIO. Tranio, be so because Lucentio loves;
12 638     And let me be a slave t' achieve that maid
12 639     Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
12 640 
12 641                        Enter BIONDELLO.
12 642 
12 643     Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?
12 644   BIONDELLO. Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
12 645     Master, has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes?
12 646     Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news?
12 647   LUCENTIO. Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,
12 648     And therefore frame your manners to the time.
12 649     Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
12 650     Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
12 651     And I for my escape have put on his;
12 652     For in a quarrel since I came ashore
12 653     I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried. 
12 654     Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
12 655     While I make way from hence to save my life.
12 656     You understand me?
12 657   BIONDELLO. I, sir? Ne'er a whit.
12 658   LUCENTIO. And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
12 659     Tranio is chang'd into Lucentio.
12 660   BIONDELLO. The better for him; would I were so too!
12 661   TRANIO. So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
12 662     That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
12 663     But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master's, I advise
12 664     You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.
12 665     When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
12 666     But in all places else your master Lucentio.
12 667   LUCENTIO. Tranio, let's go.
12 668     One thing more rests, that thyself execute-
12 669     To make one among these wooers. If thou ask me why-
12 670     Sufficeth, my reasons are both good and weighty.      Exeunt
12 671 
12 672                  The Presenters above speak
12 673  
12 674   FIRST SERVANT. My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
12 675   SLY. Yes, by Saint Anne do I. A good matter, surely; comes
12 676 there
12 677     any more of it?
12 678   PAGE. My lord, 'tis but begun.
12 679   SLY. 'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady
12 680     Would 'twere done!                        [They sit and mark]
12 681 
12 682 
12 683 
12 684 
12 685 SCENE II.
12 686 Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house
12 687 
12 688 Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO
12 689 
12 690   PETRUCHIO. Verona, for a while I take my leave,
12 691     To see my friends in Padua; but of all
12 692     My best beloved and approved friend,
12 693     Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
12 694     Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.
12 695  GRUMIO. Knock, sir! Whom should I knock?
12 696     Is there any man has rebus'd your worship?
12 697   PETRUCHIO. Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
12 698   GRUMIO. Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I
12 699     should knock you here, sir?
12 700   PETRUCHIO. Villain, I say, knock me at this gate,
12 701     And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
12 702   GRUMIO. My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you
12 703 first,
12 704     And then I know after who comes by the worst.
12 705   PETRUCHIO. Will it not be?
12 706     Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock I'll ring it;
12 707     I'll try how you can sol-fa, and sing it.
12 708                                      [He wrings him by the ears] 
12 709   GRUMIO. Help, masters, help! My master is mad.
12 710   PETRUCHIO. Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
12 711 
12 712                         Enter HORTENSIO
12 713 
12 714   HORTENSIO. How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and
12 715 my
12 716     good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
12 717   PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
12 718     'Con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may I say.
12 719   HORTENSIO. Alla nostra casa ben venuto,
12 720     Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.
12 721     Rise, Grumio, rise; we will compound this quarrel.
12 722   GRUMIO. Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin. If
12 723 this
12 724     be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service- look you,
12 725 sir:
12 726     he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it
12 727 fit
12 728     for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught
12 729 I
12 730     see, two and thirty, a pip out?
12 731     Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,
12 732     Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
12 733   PETRUCHIO. A senseless villain! Good Hortensio, 
12 734     I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
12 735     And could not get him for my heart to do it.
12 736   GRUMIO. Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words
12 737     plain: 'Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and
12 738     knock me soundly'? And come you now with 'knocking at the
12 739 gate'?
12 740   PETRUCHIO. Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
12 741   HORTENSIO. Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge;
12 742     Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
12 743     Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
12 744     And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
12 745     Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
12 746   PETRUCHIO. Such wind as scatters young men through the world
12 747     To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
12 748     Where small experience grows. But in a few,
12 749     Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
12 750     Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
12 751     And I have thrust myself into this maze,
12 752     Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;
12 753     Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
12 754     And so am come abroad to see the world. 
12 755   HORTENSIO. Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
12 756     And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
12 757     Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel,
12 758     And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
12 759     And very rich; but th'art too much my friend,
12 760     And I'll not wish thee to her.
12 761   PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
12 762     Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
12 763     One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
12 764     As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
12 765     Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
12 766     As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
12 767     As Socrates' Xanthippe or a worse-
12 768     She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
12 769     Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
12 770     As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
12 771     I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
12 772     If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
12 773   GRUMIO. Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind
12 774 is.
12 775     Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an 
12 776     aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head,
12 777 though
12 778     she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why,
12 779 nothing
12 780     comes amiss, so money comes withal.
12 781   HORTENSIO. Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
12 782     I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
12 783     I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
12 784     With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;
12 785     Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;
12 786     Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
12 787     Is- that she is intolerable curst,
12 788     And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
12 789     That, were my state far worser than it is,
12 790     I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
12 791   PETRUCHIO. Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect.
12 792     Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
12 793     For I will board her though she chide as loud
12 794     As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
12 795   HORTENSIO. Her father is Baptista Minola,
12 796     An affable and courteous gentleman;
12 797     Her name is Katherina Minola, 
12 798     Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
12 799   PETRUCHIO. I know her father, though I know not her;
12 800     And he knew my deceased father well.
12 801     I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
12 802     And therefore let me be thus bold with you
12 803     To give you over at this first encounter,
12 804     Unless you will accompany me thither.
12 805   GRUMIO. I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O'
12 806 my
12 807     word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think
12 808 scolding
12 809     would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half
12 810 a
12 811     score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; and he begin once,
12 812 he'll
12 813     rail in his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what, sir: an she
12 814 stand
12 815     him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so
12 816     disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see
12 817     withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
12 818   HORTENSIO. Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
12 819     For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.
12 820     He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
12 821     His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca;
12 822     And her withholds from me, and other more, 
12 823     Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
12 824     Supposing it a thing impossible-
12 825     For those defects I have before rehears'd-
12 826     That ever Katherina will be woo'd.
12 827     Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
12 828     That none shall have access unto Bianca
12 829     Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.
12 830   GRUMIO. Katherine the curst!
12 831     A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
12 832   HORTENSIO. Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
12 833     And offer me disguis'd in sober robes
12 834     To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
12 835     Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
12 836     That so I may by this device at least
12 837     Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
12 838     And unsuspected court her by herself.
12 839 
12 840         Enter GREMIO with LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO
12 841 
12 842   GRUMIO. Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how
12 843 the 
12 844     young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look
12 845 about
12 846     you. Who goes there, ha?
12 847   HORTENSIO. Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love.
12 848 Petruchio,
12 849     stand by awhile.
12 850   GRUMIO. A proper stripling, and an amorous!
12 851                                               [They stand aside]
12 852   GREMIO. O, very well; I have perus'd the note.
12 853     Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound-
12 854     All books of love, see that at any hand;
12 855     And see you read no other lectures to her.
12 856     You understand me- over and beside
12 857     Signior Baptista's liberality,
12 858     I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
12 859     And let me have them very well perfum'd;
12 860     For she is sweeter than perfume itself
12 861     To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
12 862   LUCENTIO. Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
12 863     As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,
12 864     As firmly as yourself were still in place;
12 865     Yea, and perhaps with more successful words 
12 866     Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
12 867   GREMIO. O this learning, what a thing it is!
12 868   GRUMIO. O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
12 869   PETRUCHIO. Peace, sirrah!
12 870   HORTENSIO. Grumio, mum!                       [Coming forward]
12 871     God save you, Signior Gremio!
12 872   GREMIO. And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
12 873     Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
12 874     I promis'd to enquire carefully
12 875     About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;
12 876     And by good fortune I have lighted well
12 877     On this young man; for learning and behaviour
12 878     Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
12 879     And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.
12 880   HORTENSIO. 'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
12 881     Hath promis'd me to help me to another,
12 882     A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
12 883     So shall I no whit be behind in duty
12 884     To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
12 885   GREMIO. Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove. 
12 886   GRUMIO. And that his bags shall prove.
12 887   HORTENSIO. Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
12 888     Listen to me, and if you speak me fair
12 889     I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
12 890     Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
12 891     Upon agreement from us to his liking,
12 892     Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;
12 893     Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
12 894   GREMIO. So said, so done, is well.
12 895     Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
12 896   PETRUCHIO. I know she is an irksome brawling scold;
12 897     If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
12 898   GREMIO. No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
12 899   PETRUCHIO. Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.
12 900     My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
12 901     And I do hope good days and long to see.
12 902   GREMIO. O Sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
12 903     But if you have a stomach, to't a God's name;
12 904     You shall have me assisting you in all.
12 905     But will you woo this wild-cat? 
12 906   PETRUCHIO. Will I live?
12 907   GRUMIO. Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.
12 908   PETRUCHIO. Why came I hither but to that intent?
12 909     Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
12 910     Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
12 911     Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
12 912     Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
12 913     Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
12 914     And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
12 915     Have I not in a pitched battle heard
12 916     Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
12 917     And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
12 918     That gives not half so great a blow to hear
12 919     As will a chestnut in a fariner's fire?
12 920     Tush! tush! fear boys with bugs.
12 921   GRUMIO. For he fears none.
12 922   GREMIO. Hortensio, hark:
12 923     This gentleman is happily arriv'd,
12 924     My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
12 925   HORTENSIO. I promis'd we would be contributors 
12 926     And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.
12 927   GREMIO. And so we will- provided that he win her.
12 928   GRUMIO. I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
12 929 
12 930     Enter TRANIO, bravely apparelled as LUCENTIO, and BIONDELLO
12 931 
12 932   TRANIO. Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,
12 933     Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
12 934     To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
12 935   BIONDELLO. He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you
12 936 mean?
12 937   TRANIO. Even he, Biondello.
12 938   GREMIO. Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-
12 939   TRANIO. Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?
12 940   PETRUCHIO. Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
12 941   TRANIO. I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
12 942   LUCENTIO.  [Aside]  Well begun, Tranio.
12 943   HORTENSIO. Sir, a word ere you go.
12 944     Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
12 945   TRANIO. And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
12 946   GREMIO. No; if without more words you will get you hence. 
12 947   TRANIO. Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
12 948     For me as for you?
12 949   GREMIO. But so is not she.
12 950 
12 951   TRANIO. For what reason, I beseech you?
12 952   GREMIO. For this reason, if you'll know,
12 953     That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
12 954   HORTENSIO. That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
12 955   TRANIO. Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,
12 956     Do me this right- hear me with patience.
12 957     Baptista is a noble gentleman,
12 958     To whom my father is not all unknown,
12 959     And, were his daughter fairer than she is,
12 960     She may more suitors have, and me for one.
12 961     Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
12 962     Then well one more may fair Bianca have;
12 963     And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,
12 964     Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
12 965   GREMIO. What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!
12 966   LUCENTIO. Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade. 
12 967   PETRUCHIO. Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
12 968   HORTENSIO. Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
12 969     Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
12 970   TRANIO. No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:
12 971     The one as famous for a scolding tongue
12 972     As is the other for beauteous modesty.
12 973   PETRUCHIO. Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
12 974   GREMIO. Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,
12 975     And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
12 976   PETRUCHIO. Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
12 977     The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
12 978     Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
12 979     And will not promise her to any man
12 980     Until the elder sister first be wed.
12 981     The younger then is free, and not before.
12 982   TRANIO. If it be so, sir, that you are the man
12 983     Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;
12 984     And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
12 985     Achieve the elder, set the younger free
12 986     For our access- whose hap shall be to have her 
12 987     Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
12 988   HORTENSIO. Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
12 989     And since you do profess to be a suitor,
12 990     You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
12 991     To whom we all rest generally beholding.
12 992   TRANIO. Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
12 993     Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
12 994     And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;
12 995     And do as adversaries do in law-
12 996     Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
12 997   GRUMIO, BIONDELLO. O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
12 998   HORTENSIO. The motion's good indeed, and be it so.
12 999     Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.                Exeunt

12 1015 ACT II. SCENE I.
12 1016 Padua. BAPTISTA'S house
12 1017 
12 1018 Enter KATHERINA and BIANCA
12 1019 
12 1020   BIANCA. Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
12 1021     To make a bondmaid and a slave of me-
12 1022     That I disdain; but for these other gawds,
12 1023     Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
12 1024     Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
12 1025     Or what you will command me will I do,
12 1026     So well I know my duty to my elders.
12 1027   KATHERINA. Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
12 1028     Whom thou lov'st best. See thou dissemble not.
12 1029   BIANCA. Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
12 1030     I never yet beheld that special face
12 1031     Which I could fancy more than any other.
12 1032   KATHERINA. Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
12 1033   BIANCA. If you affect him, sister, here I swear
12 1034     I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him.
12 1035   KATHERINA. O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
12 1036     You will have Gremio to keep you fair. 
12 1037   BIANCA. Is it for him you do envy me so?
12 1038     Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive
12 1039     You have but jested with me all this while.
12 1040     I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
12 1041   KATHERINA. [Strikes her]  If that be jest, then an the rest was
12 1042 so.
12 1043 
12 1044                             Enter BAPTISTA
12 1045 
12 1046   BAPTISTA. Why, how now, dame! Whence grows this insolence?
12 1047     Bianca, stand aside- poor girl! she weeps.
12 1048                                                 [He unbinds her]
12 1049     Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
12 1050     For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
12 1051     Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
12 1052     When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
12 1053   KATHERINA. Her silence flouts me, and I'll be reveng'd.
12 1054                                             [Flies after BIANCA]
12 1055   BAPTISTA. What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
12 1056                                                      Exit BIANCA
12 1057   KATHERINA. What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see 
12 1058     She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
12 1059     I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,
12 1060     And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
12 1061     Talk not to me; I will go sit and weep,
12 1062     Till I can find occasion of revenge.          Exit KATHERINA
12 1063   BAPTISTA. Was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I?
12 1064     But who comes here?
12 1065 
12 1066         Enter GREMIO, with LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man;
12 1067          PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO,
12 1068     as LUCENTIO, with his boy, BIONDELLO, bearing a lute and
12 1069 books
12 1070 
12 1071   GREMIO. Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
12 1072   BAPTISTA. Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
12 1073     God save you, gentlemen!
12 1074   PETRUCHIO. And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
12 1075     Call'd Katherina, fair and virtuous?
12 1076   BAPTISTA. I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katherina.
12 1077   GREMIO. You are too blunt; go to it orderly.
12 1078   PETRUCHIO. You wrong me, Signior Gremio; give me leave. 
12 1079     I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
12 1080     That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
12 1081     Her affability and bashful modesty,
12 1082     Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
12 1083     Am bold to show myself a forward guest
12 1084     Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
12 1085     Of that report which I so oft have heard.
12 1086     And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
12 1087     I do present you with a man of mine,
12 1088                                           [Presenting HORTENSIO]
12 1089     Cunning in music and the mathematics,
12 1090     To instruct her fully in those sciences,
12 1091     Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
12 1092     Accept of him, or else you do me wrong-
12 1093     His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
12 1094   BAPTISTA. Y'are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;
12 1095     But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,
12 1096     She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
12 1097   PETRUCHIO. I see you do not mean to part with her;
12 1098     Or else you like not of my company. 
12 1099   BAPTISTA. Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
12 1100     Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?
12 1101   PETRUCHIO. Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,
12 1102     A man well known throughout all Italy.
12 1103   BAPTISTA. I know him well; you are welcome for his sake.
12 1104   GREMIO. Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
12 1105     Let us that are poor petitioners speak too.
12 1106     Bacare! you are marvellous forward.
12 1107   PETRUCHIO. O, pardon me, Signior Gremio! I would fain be doing.
12 1108   GREMIO. I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
12 1109     Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To
12 1110     express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly
12 1111     beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young
12 1112     scholar  [Presenting LUCENTIO]  that hath been long studying
12 1113 at
12 1114     Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as
12 1115 the
12 1116     other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray
12 1117 accept
12 1118     his service.
12 1119   BAPTISTA. A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good
12 1120 Cambio.
12 1121     [To TRANIO]  But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a
12 1122 stranger.
12 1123     May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming? 
12 1124   TRANIO. Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
12 1125     That, being a stranger in this city here,
12 1126     Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
12 1127     Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
12 1128     Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
12 1129     In the preferment of the eldest sister.
12 1130     This liberty is all that I request-
12 1131     That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
12 1132     I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
12 1133     And free access and favour as the rest.
12 1134     And toward the education of your daughters
12 1135     I here bestow a simple instrument,
12 1136     And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.
12 1137     If you accept them, then their worth is great.
12 1138   BAPTISTA. Lucentio is your name? Of whence, I pray?
12 1139   TRANIO. Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
12 1140   BAPTISTA. A mighty man of Pisa. By report
12 1141     I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.
12 1142     Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
12 1143     You shall go see your pupils presently. 
12 1144     Holla, within!
12 1145 
12 1146                          Enter a SERVANT
12 1147 
12 1148     Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
12 1149     To my daughters; and tell them both
12 1150     These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.
12 1151 
12 1152                 Exit SERVANT leading HORTENSIO carrying the lute
12 1153                                      and LUCENTIO with the books
12 1154 
12 1155     We will go walk a little in the orchard,
12 1156     And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
12 1157     And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
12 1158   PETRUCHIO. Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
12 1159     And every day I cannot come to woo.
12 1160     You knew my father well, and in him me,
12 1161     Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
12 1162     Which I have bettered rather than decreas'd.
12 1163     Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love, 
12 1164     What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
12 1165   BAPTISTA. After my death, the one half of my lands
12 1166     And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
12 1167   PETRUCHIO. And for that dowry, I'll assure her of
12 1168     Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
12 1169     In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
12 1170     Let specialities be therefore drawn between us,
12 1171     That covenants may be kept on either hand.
12 1172   BAPTISTA. Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
12 1173     That is, her love; for that is all in all.
12 1174   PETRUCHIO. Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
12 1175     I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
12 1176     And where two raging fires meet together,
12 1177     They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
12 1178     Though little fire grows great with little wind,
12 1179     Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
12 1180     So I to her, and so she yields to me;
12 1181     For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.
12 1182   BAPTISTA. Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed
12 1183     But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words. 
12 1184   PETRUCHIO. Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
12 1185     That shake not though they blow perpetually.
12 1186 
12 1187              Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke
12 1188 
12 1189   BAPTISTA. How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?
12 1190   HORTENSIO. For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
12 1191   BAPTISTA. What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
12 1192   HORTENSIO. I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
12 1193     Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
12 1194   BAPTISTA. Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
12 1195   HORTENSIO. Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
12 1196     I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
12 1197     And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,
12 1198     When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
12 1199     'Frets, call you these?' quoth she 'I'll fume with them.'
12 1200     And with that word she struck me on the head,
12 1201     And through the instrument my pate made way;
12 1202     And there I stood amazed for a while,
12 1203     As on a pillory, looking through the lute, 
12 1204     While she did call me rascal fiddler
12 1205     And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,
12 1206     As she had studied to misuse me so.
12 1207   PETRUCHIO. Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
12 1208     I love her ten times more than e'er I did.
12 1209     O, how I long to have some chat with her!
12 1210   BAPTISTA. Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;
12 1211     Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
12 1212     She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
12 1213     Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
12 1214     Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
12 1215   PETRUCHIO. I pray you do.             Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
12 1216     I'll attend her here,
12 1217     And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
12 1218     Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain
12 1219     She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
12 1220     Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
12 1221     As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.
12 1222     Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;
12 1223     Then I'll commend her volubility, 
12 1224     And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.
12 1225     If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
12 1226     As though she bid me stay by her a week;
12 1227     If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
12 1228     When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.
12 1229     But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
12 1230 
12 1231                         Enter KATHERINA
12 1232 
12 1233     Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.
12 1234   KATHERINA. Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
12 1235     They call me Katherine that do talk of me.
12 1236   PETRUCHIO. You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
12 1237     And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
12 1238     But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
12 1239     Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
12 1240     For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
12 1241     Take this of me, Kate of my consolation-
12 1242     Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
12 1243     Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded, 
12 1244     Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
12 1245     Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.
12 1246   KATHERINA. Mov'd! in good time! Let him that mov'd you hither
12 1247     Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
12 1248     You were a moveable.
12 1249   PETRUCHIO. Why, what's a moveable?
12 1250   KATHERINA. A join'd-stool.
12 1251   PETRUCHIO. Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.
12 1252   KATHERINA. Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
12 1253   PETRUCHIO. Women are made to bear, and so are you.
12 1254   KATHERINA. No such jade as you, if me you mean.
12 1255   PETRUCHIO. Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee!
12 1256     For, knowing thee to be but young and light-
12 1257   KATHERINA. Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
12 1258     And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
12 1259   PETRUCHIO. Should be! should- buzz!
12 1260   KATHERINA. Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
12 1261   PETRUCHIO. O, slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
12 1262   KATHERINA. Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
12 1263   PETRUCHIO. Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry. 
12 1264   KATHERINA. If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
12 1265   PETRUCHIO. My remedy is then to pluck it out.
12 1266   KATHERINA. Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
12 1267   PETRUCHIO. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
12 1268     In his tail.
12 1269   KATHERINA. In his tongue.
12 1270   PETRUCHIO. Whose tongue?
12 1271   KATHERINA. Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.
12 1272   PETRUCHIO. What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
12 1273     Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
12 1274   KATHERINA. That I'll try.                    [She strikes him]
12 1275   PETRUCHIO. I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
12 1276   KATHERINA. So may you lose your arms.
12 1277     If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
12 1278     And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
12 1279   PETRUCHIO. A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
12 1280   KATHERINA. What is your crest- a coxcomb?
12 1281   PETRUCHIO. A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
12 1282   KATHERINA. No cock of mine: you crow too like a craven.
12 1283   PETRUCHIO. Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour. 
12 1284   KATHERINA. It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
12 1285   PETRUCHIO. Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
12 1286   KATHERINA. There is, there is.
12 1287   PETRUCHIO. Then show it me.
12 1288   KATHERINA. Had I a glass I would.
12 1289   PETRUCHIO. What, you mean my face?
12 1290   KATHERINA. Well aim'd of such a young one.
12 1291   PETRUCHIO. Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
12 1292   KATHERINA. Yet you are wither'd.
12 1293   PETRUCHIO. 'Tis with cares.
12 1294   KATHERINA. I care not.
12 1295   PETRUCHIO. Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.
12 1296   KATHERINA. I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.
12 1297   PETRUCHIO. No, not a whit; I find you passing gentle.
12 1298     'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
12 1299     And now I find report a very liar;
12 1300     For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
12 1301     But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.
12 1302     Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
12 1303     Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will, 
12 1304     Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
12 1305     But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;
12 1306     With gentle conference, soft and affable.
12 1307     Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
12 1308     O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
12 1309     Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
12 1310     As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
12 1311     O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
12 1312   KATHERINA. Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
12 1313   PETRUCHIO. Did ever Dian so become a grove
12 1314     As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
12 1315     O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
12 1316     And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!
12 1317   KATHERINA. Where did you study all this goodly speech?
12 1318   PETRUCHIO. It is extempore, from my mother wit.
12 1319   KATHERINA. A witty mother! witless else her son.
12 1320   PETRUCHIO. Am I not wise?
12 1321   KATHERINA. Yes, keep you warm.
12 1322   PETRUCHIO. Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
12 1323     And therefore, setting all this chat aside, 
12 1324     Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
12 1325     That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;
12 1326     And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
12 1327     Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
12 1328     For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
12 1329     Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
12 1330     Thou must be married to no man but me;
12 1331     For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
12 1332     And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
12 1333     Conformable as other household Kates.
12 1334 
12 1335                Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO
12 1336 
12 1337     Here comes your father. Never make denial;
12 1338     I must and will have Katherine to my wife.
12 1339   BAPTISTA. Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my
12 1340 daughter?
12 1341   PETRUCHIO. How but well, sir? how but well?
12 1342     It were impossible I should speed amiss.
12 1343   BAPTISTA. Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?
12 1344   KATHERINA. Call you me daughter? Now I promise you 
12 1345     You have show'd a tender fatherly regard
12 1346     To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
12 1347     A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
12 1348     That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
12 1349   PETRUCHIO. Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world
12 1350     That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.
12 1351     If she be curst, it is for policy,
12 1352     For,she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
12 1353     She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
12 1354     For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
12 1355     And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.
12 1356     And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together
12 1357     That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
12 1358   KATHERINA. I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
12 1359   GREMIO. Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd first.
12 1360   TRANIO. Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!
12 1361   PETRUCHIO. Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;
12 1362     If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
12 1363     'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
12 1364     That she shall still be curst in company. 
12 1365     I tell you 'tis incredible to believe.
12 1366     How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!
12 1367     She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
12 1368     She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
12 1369     That in a twink she won me to her love.
12 1370     O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see,
12 1371     How tame, when men and women are alone,
12 1372     A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
12 1373     Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,
12 1374     To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
12 1375     Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
12 1376     I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
12 1377   BAPTISTA. I know not what to say; but give me your hands.
12 1378     God send you joy, Petruchio! 'Tis a match.
12 1379   GREMIO, TRANIO. Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.
12 1380   PETRUCHIO. Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
12 1381     I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
12 1382     We will have rings and things, and fine array;
12 1383     And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.
12 1384                         Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA severally 
12 1385   GREMIO. Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
12 1386   BAPTISTA. Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
12 1387     And venture madly on a desperate mart.
12 1388   TRANIO. 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;
12 1389     'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
12 1390   BAPTISTA. The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
12 1391   GREMIO. No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
12 1392     But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:
12 1393     Now is the day we long have looked for;
12 1394     I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
12 1395   TRANIO. And I am one that love Bianca more
12 1396     Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
12 1397   GREMIO. Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
12 1398   TRANIO. Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.
12 1399   GREMIO. But thine doth fry.
12 1400     Skipper, stand back; 'tis age that nourisheth.
12 1401   TRANIO. But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
12 1402   BAPTISTA. Content you, gentlemen; I will compound this strife.
12 1403     'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
12 1404     That can assure my daughter greatest dower 
12 1405     Shall have my Bianca's love.
12 1406     Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
12 1407   GREMIO. First, as you know, my house within the city
12 1408     Is richly furnished with plate and gold,
12 1409     Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
12 1410     My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
12 1411     In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
12 1412     In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
12 1413     Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
12 1414     Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
12 1415     Valance of Venice gold in needle-work;
12 1416     Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs
12 1417     To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm
12 1418     I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
12 1419     Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
12 1420     And all things answerable to this portion.
12 1421     Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
12 1422     And if I die to-morrow this is hers,
12 1423     If whilst I live she will be only mine.
12 1424   TRANIO. That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me: 
12 1425     I am my father's heir and only son;
12 1426     If I may have your daughter to my wife,
12 1427     I'll leave her houses three or four as good
12 1428     Within rich Pisa's walls as any one
12 1429     Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
12 1430     Besides two thousand ducats by the year
12 1431     Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
12 1432     What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
12 1433   GREMIO. Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
12 1434     [Aside]  My land amounts not to so much in all.-
12 1435     That she shall have, besides an argosy
12 1436     That now is lying in Marseilles road.
12 1437     What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?
12 1438   TRANIO. Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
12 1439     Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
12 1440     And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,
12 1441     And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next.
12 1442   GREMIO. Nay, I have off'red all; I have no more;
12 1443     And she can have no more than all I have;
12 1444     If you like me, she shall have me and mine. 
12 1445   TRANIO. Why, then the maid is mine from all the world
12 1446     By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.
12 1447   BAPTISTA. I must confess your offer is the best;
12 1448     And let your father make her the assurance,
12 1449     She is your own. Else, you must pardon me;
12 1450     If you should die before him, where's her dower?
12 1451   TRANIO. That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.
12 1452   GREMIO. And may not young men die as well as old?
12 1453   BAPTISTA. Well, gentlemen,
12 1454     I am thus resolv'd: on Sunday next you know
12 1455     My daughter Katherine is to be married;
12 1456     Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca
12 1457     Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
12 1458     If not, to Signior Gremio.
12 1459     And so I take my leave, and thank you both.
12 1460   GREMIO. Adieu, good neighbour.                   Exit BAPTISTA
12 1461     Now, I fear thee not.
12 1462     Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
12 1463     To give thee all, and in his waning age
12 1464     Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy! 
12 1465     An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.              Exit
12 1466   TRANIO. A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
12 1467     Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.
12 1468     'Tis in my head to do my master good:
12 1469     I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio
12 1470     Must get a father, call'd suppos'd Vincentio;
12 1471     And that's a wonder- fathers commonly
12 1472     Do get their children; but in this case of wooing
12 1473     A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
12 1474  Exit

12 1490 ACT III. SCENE I.
12 1491 Padua. BAPTISTA'S house
12 1492 
12 1493 Enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, HORTENSIO as LICIO, and BIANCA
12 1494 
12 1495   LUCENTIO. Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir.
12 1496     Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
12 1497     Her sister Katherine welcome'd you withal?
12 1498   HORTENSIO. But, wrangling pedant, this is
12 1499     The patroness of heavenly harmony.
12 1500     Then give me leave to have prerogative;
12 1501     And when in music we have spent an hour,
12 1502     Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
12 1503   LUCENTIO. Preposterous ass, that never read so far
12 1504     To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
12 1505     Was it not to refresh the mind of man
12 1506     After his studies or his usual pain?
12 1507     Then give me leave to read philosophy,
12 1508     And while I pause serve in your harmony.
12 1509   HORTENSIO. Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
12 1510   BIANCA. Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
12 1511     To strive for that which resteth in my choice. 
12 1512     I arn no breeching scholar in the schools,
12 1513     I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
12 1514     But learn my lessons as I please myself.
12 1515     And to cut off all strife: here sit we down;
12 1516     Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
12 1517     His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd.
12 1518   HORTENSIO. You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
12 1519   LUCENTIO. That will be never- tune your instrument.
12 1520   BIANCA. Where left we last?
12 1521   LUCENTIO. Here, madam:
12 1522     'Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,
12 1523     Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
12 1524   BIANCA. Construe them.
12 1525   LUCENTIO. 'Hic ibat' as I told you before- 'Simois' I am
12 1526 Lucentio-
12 1527     'hic est' son unto Vincentio of Pisa- 'Sigeia tellus'
12 1528 disguised
12 1529     thus to get your love- 'Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that
12 1530     comes a-wooing- 'Priami' is my man Tranio- 'regia' bearing my
12 1531     port- 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon.
12 1532   HORTENSIO. Madam, my instrument's in tune.
12 1533   BIANCA. Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars. 
12 1534   LUCENTIO. Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
12 1535   BIANCA. Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat Simois'
12 1536 I
12 1537     know you not- 'hic est Sigeia tellus' I trust you not- 'Hic
12 1538     steterat Priami' take heed he hear us not- 'regia' presume
12 1539 not-
12 1540    'celsa senis' despair not.
12 1541   HORTENSIO. Madam, 'tis now in tune.
12 1542   LUCENTIO. All but the bass.
12 1543   HORTENSIO. The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
12 1544     [Aside]  How fiery and forward our pedant is!
12 1545     Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
12 1546     Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
12 1547   BIANCA. In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
12 1548   LUCENTIO. Mistrust it not- for sure, AEacides
12 1549     Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
12 1550   BIANCA. I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
12 1551     I should be arguing still upon that doubt;
12 1552     But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.
12 1553     Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,
12 1554     That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
12 1555   HORTENSIO.  [To LUCENTIO]  You may go walk and give me leave 
12 1556       awhile;
12 1557     My lessons make no music in three Parts.
12 1558   LUCENTIO. Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,
12 1559     [Aside]  And watch withal; for, but I be deceiv'd,
12 1560     Our fine musician groweth amorous.
12 1561   HORTENSIO. Madam, before you touch the instrument
12 1562     To learn the order of my fingering,
12 1563     I must begin with rudiments of art,
12 1564     To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
12 1565     More pleasant, pithy, and effectual,
12 1566     Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
12 1567     And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
12 1568   BIANCA. Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
12 1569   HORTENSIO. Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
12 1570   BIANCA.  [Reads]
12 1571          '"Gamut" I am, the ground of all accord-
12 1572          "A re" to plead Hortensio's passion-
12 1573          "B mi" Bianca, take him for thy lord-
12 1574          "C fa ut" that loves with all affection-
12 1575          "D sol re" one clef, two notes have I- 
12 1576          "E la mi" show pity or I die.'
12 1577     Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not!
12 1578     Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice
12 1579     To change true rules for odd inventions.
12 1580 
12 1581                        Enter a SERVANT
12 1582 
12 1583   SERVANT. Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
12 1584     And help to dress your sister's chamber up.
12 1585     You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
12 1586   BIANCA. Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone.
12 1587                                        Exeunt BIANCA and SERVANT
12 1588   LUCENTIO. Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
12 1589  Exit
12 1590   HORTENSIO. But I have cause to pry into this pedant;
12 1591     Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
12 1592     Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
12 1593     To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale-
12 1594     Seize thee that list. If once I find thee ranging,
12 1595   HORTENSIO will be quit with thee by changing.             Exit
12 1596 
12 1597 
12 1598 
12 1599 
12 1600 SCENE II.
12 1601 Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house
12 1602 
12 1603 Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO as LUCENTIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA,
12 1604 LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, and ATTENDANTS
12 1605 
12 1606   BAPTISTA.  [To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed
12 1607 day
12 1608     That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,
12 1609     And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
12 1610     What will be said? What mockery will it be
12 1611     To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
12 1612     To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
12 1613     What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
12 1614   KATHERINA. No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc'd
12 1615     To give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,
12 1616     Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,
12 1617     Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
12 1618     I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
12 1619     Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
12 1620     And, to be noted for a merry man,
12 1621     He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
12 1622     Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns; 
12 1623     Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
12 1624     Now must the world point at poor Katherine,
12 1625     And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
12 1626     If it would please him come and marry her!'
12 1627   TRANIO. Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
12 1628     Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
12 1629     Whatever fortune stays him from his word.
12 1630     Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
12 1631     Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
12 1632   KATHERINA. Would Katherine had never seen him though!
12 1633                     Exit, weeping, followed by BIANCA and others
12 1634   BAPTISTA. Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,
12 1635     For such an injury would vex a very saint;
12 1636     Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
12 1637 
12 1638                            Enter BIONDELLO
12 1639 
12 1640     Master, master! News, and such old news as you never heard
12 1641 of!
12 1642   BAPTISTA. Is it new and old too? How may that be?
12 1643   BIONDELLO. Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming? 
12 1644   BAPTISTA. Is he come?
12 1645   BIONDELLO. Why, no, sir.
12 1646   BAPTISTA. What then?
12 1647   BIONDELLO. He is coming.
12 1648   BAPTISTA. When will he be here?
12 1649   BIONDELLO. When he stands where I am and sees you there.
12 1650   TRANIO. But, say, what to thine old news?
12 1651   BIONDELLO. Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old
12 1652     jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd; a pair of boots
12 1653     that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac'd; an
12 1654 old
12 1655     rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury, with a broken
12 1656 hilt,
12 1657     and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp'd, with
12 1658 an
12 1659     old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides,
12 1660 possess'd
12 1661     with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled
12 1662 with
12 1663     the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls,
12 1664 sped
12 1665     with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives,
12 1666     stark spoil'd with the staggers, begnawn with the bots,
12 1667 sway'd in
12 1668     the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legg'd before, and with a
12 1669     half-cheek'd bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather which,
12 1670     being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often 
12 1671     burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times
12 1672 piec'd,
12 1673     and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for
12 1674 her
12 1675     name fairly set down in studs, and here and there piec'd with
12 1676     pack-thread.
12 1677   BAPTISTA. Who comes with him?
12 1678   BIONDELLO. O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd
12 1679 like
12 1680     the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey
12 1681 boot-hose
12 1682     on the other, gart'red with a red and blue list; an old hat,
12 1683 and
12 1684     the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather; a
12 1685     monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
12 1686     footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
12 1687   TRANIO. 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
12 1688     Yet oftentimes lie goes but mean-apparell'd.
12 1689   BAPTISTA. I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
12 1690   BIONDELLO. Why, sir, he comes not.
12 1691   BAPTISTA. Didst thou not say he comes?
12 1692   BIONDELLO. Who? that Petruchio came?
12 1693   BAPTISTA. Ay, that Petruchio came.
12 1694   BIONDELLO. No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.
12 1695   BAPTISTA. Why, that's all one. 
12 1696   BIONDELLO. Nay, by Saint Jamy,
12 1697              I hold you a penny,
12 1698              A horse and a man
12 1699              Is more than one,
12 1700              And yet not many.
12 1701 
12 1702                   Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
12 1703 
12 1704   PETRUCHIO. Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?
12 1705   BAPTISTA. You are welcome, sir.
12 1706   PETRUCHIO. And yet I come not well.
12 1707   BAPTISTA. And yet you halt not.
12 1708   TRANIO. Not so well apparell'd
12 1709     As I wish you were.
12 1710   PETRUCHIO. Were it better, I should rush in thus.
12 1711     But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
12 1712     How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown;
12 1713     And wherefore gaze this goodly company
12 1714     As if they saw some wondrous monument,
12 1715     Some comet or unusual prodigy? 
12 1716   BAPTISTA. Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day.
12 1717     First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
12 1718     Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
12 1719     Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
12 1720     An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
12 1721   TRANIO. And tell us what occasion of import
12 1722     Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
12 1723     And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
12 1724   PETRUCHIO. Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear;
12 1725     Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
12 1726     Though in some part enforced to digress,
12 1727     Which at more leisure I will so excuse
12 1728     As you shall well be satisfied withal.
12 1729     But where is Kate? I stay too long from her;
12 1730     The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
12 1731   TRANIO. See not your bride in these unreverent robes;
12 1732     Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
12 1733   PETRUCHIO. Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
12 1734   BAPTISTA. But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
12 1735   PETRUCHIO. Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with
12 1736 words; 
12 1737     To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
12 1738     Could I repair what she will wear in me
12 1739     As I can change these poor accoutrements,
12 1740     'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
12 1741     But what a fool am I to chat with you,
12 1742     When I should bid good-morrow to my bride
12 1743     And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
12 1744                                   Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
12 1745   TRANIO. He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
12 1746     We will persuade him, be it possible,
12 1747     To put on better ere he go to church.
12 1748   BAPTISTA. I'll after him and see the event of this.
12 1749               Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, BIONDELLO, and ATTENDENTS
12 1750   TRANIO. But to her love concerneth us to ad
12 1751     Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,
12 1752     As I before imparted to your worship,
12 1753     I am to get a man- whate'er he be
12 1754     It skills not much; we'll fit him to our turn-
12 1755     And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
12 1756     And make assurance here in Padua 
12 1757     Of greater sums than I have promised.
12 1758     So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
12 1759     And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
12 1760   LUCENTIO. Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
12 1761     Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
12 1762     'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
12 1763     Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
12 1764     I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.
12 1765   TRANIO. That by degrees we mean to look into
12 1766     And watch our vantage in this business;
12 1767     We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
12 1768     The narrow-prying father, Minola,
12 1769     The quaint musician, amorous Licio-
12 1770     All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
12 1771 
12 1772                            Re-enter GREMIO
12 1773 
12 1774     Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
12 1775   GREMIO. As willingly as e'er I came from school.
12 1776   TRANIO. And is the bride and bridegroom coming home? 
12 1777   GREMIO. A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,
12 1778     A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
12 1779   TRANIO. Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
12 1780   GREMIO. Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
12 1781   TRANIO. Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
12 1782   GREMIO. Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him!
12 1783     I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
12 1784     Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,
12 1785     'Ay, by gogs-wouns' quoth he, and swore so loud
12 1786     That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
12 1787     And as he stoop'd again to take it up,
12 1788     This mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
12 1789     That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.
12 1790     'Now take them up,' quoth he 'if any list.'
12 1791   TRANIO. What said the wench, when he rose again?
12 1792   GREMIO. Trembled and shook, for why he stamp'd and swore
12 1793     As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
12 1794     But after many ceremonies done
12 1795     He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
12 1796     He had been abroad, carousing to his mates 
12 1797     After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
12 1798     And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
12 1799     Having no other reason
12 1800     But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
12 1801     And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
12 1802     This done, he took the bride about the neck,
12 1803     And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
12 1804     That at the parting all the church did echo.
12 1805     And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
12 1806     And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
12 1807     Such a mad marriage never was before.
12 1808     Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.         [Music plays]
12 1809 
12 1810        Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO,
12 1811                          GRUMIO, and train
12 1812 
12 1813   PETRUCHIO. Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.
12 1814     I know you think to dine with me to-day,
12 1815     And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer
12 1816     But so it is- my haste doth call me hence, 
12 1817     And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
12 1818   BAPTISTA. Is't possible you will away to-night?
12 1819   PETRUCHIO. I must away to-day before night come.
12 1820     Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
12 1821     You would entreat me rather go than stay.
12 1822     And, honest company, I thank you all
12 1823     That have beheld me give away myself
12 1824     To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.
12 1825     Dine with my father, drink a health to me.
12 1826     For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
12 1827   TRANIO. Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
12 1828   PETRUCHIO. It may not be.
12 1829   GREMIO. Let me entreat you.
12 1830   PETRUCHIO. It cannot be.
12 1831   KATHERINA. Let me entreat you.
12 1832   PETRUCHIO. I am content.
12 1833   KATHERINA. Are you content to stay?
12 1834   PETRUCHIO. I am content you shall entreat me stay;
12 1835     But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
12 1836   KATHERINA. Now, if you love me, stay. 
12 1837   PETRUCHIO. Grumio, my horse.
12 1838   GRUMIO. Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.
12 1839   KATHERINA. Nay, then,
12 1840     Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
12 1841     No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
12 1842     The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
12 1843     You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
12 1844     For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself.
12 1845     'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
12 1846     That take it on you at the first so roundly.
12 1847   PETRUCHIO. O Kate, content thee; prithee be not angry.
12 1848   KATHERINA. I will be angry; what hast thou to do?
12 1849     Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
12 1850   GREMIO. Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
12 1851   KATHERINA. Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.
12 1852     I see a woman may be made a fool
12 1853     If she had not a spirit to resist.
12 1854   PETRUCHIO. They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
12 1855     Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
12 1856     Go to the feast, revel and domineer, 
12 1857     Carouse full measure to her maidenhead;
12 1858     Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.
12 1859     But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
12 1860     Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
12 1861     I will be master of what is mine own-
12 1862     She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,
12 1863     My household stuff, my field, my barn,
12 1864     My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
12 1865     And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;
12 1866     I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
12 1867     That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
12 1868     Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;
12 1869     Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
12 1870     Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate;
12 1871     I'll buckler thee against a million.
12 1872                          Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, and GRUMIO
12 1873   BAPTISTA. Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
12 1874   GREMIO. Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
12 1875   TRANIO. Of all mad matches, never was the like.
12 1876   LUCENTIO. Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister? 
12 1877   BIANCA. That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
12 1878   GREMIO. I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
12 1879   BAPTISTA. Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom
12 1880 wants
12 1881     For to supply the places at the table,
12 1882     You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
12 1883     Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place;
12 1884     And let Bianca take her sister's room.
12 1885   TRANIO. Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
12 1886   BAPTISTA. She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
12 1887                                                           Exeunt

12 1903 ACT IV. SCENE I.
12 1904 PETRUCHIO'S country house
12 1905 
12 1906 Enter GRUMIO
12 1907 
12 1908   GRUMIO. Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
12 1909 all
12 1910     foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray'd? Was
12 1911     ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they
12 1912 are
12 1913     coming after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and
12 1914 soon
12 1915     hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the
12 1916 roof
12 1917     of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a
12 1918 fire to
12 1919     thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for,
12 1920     considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.
12 1921     Holla, ho! Curtis!
12 1922 
12 1923                             Enter CURTIS
12 1924 
12 1925   CURTIS. Who is that calls so coldly?
12 1926   GRUMIO. A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from
12 1927 my
12 1928     shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my
12 1929     neck. A fire, good Curtis.
12 1930   CURTIS. Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio? 
12 1931   GRUMIO. O, ay, Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no
12 1932     water.
12 1933   CURTIS. Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
12 1934   GRUMIO. She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou
12 1935 know'st
12 1936     winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tam'd my old
12 1937     master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.
12 1938   CURTIS. Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
12 1939   GRUMIO. Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so
12 1940 long
12 1941     am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I
12 1942 complain
12 1943     on thee to our mistress, whose hand- she being now at hand-
12 1944 thou
12 1945     shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy
12 1946 hot
12 1947     office?
12 1948   CURTIS. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?
12 1949   GRUMIO. A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
12 1950     therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master
12 1951 and
12 1952     mistress are almost frozen to death.
12 1953   CURTIS. There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the
12 1954 news?
12 1955   GRUMIO. Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou
12 1956 wilt.
12 1957   CURTIS. Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
12 1958   GRUMIO. Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold. 
12 1959     Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes
12 1960     strew'd, cobwebs swept, the serving-men in their new fustian,
12 1961     their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment
12 1962 on?
12 1963     Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, the carpets
12 1964     laid, and everything in order?
12 1965   CURTIS. All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
12 1966   GRUMIO. First know my horse is tired; my master and mistress
12 1967 fall'n
12 1968     out.
12 1969   CURTIS. How?
12 1970   GRUMIO. Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a
12 1971     tale.
12 1972   CURTIS. Let's ha't, good Grumio.
12 1973   GRUMIO. Lend thine ear.
12 1974   CURTIS. Here.
12 1975   GRUMIO. There.                                  [Striking him]
12 1976   CURTIS. This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
12 1977   GRUMIO. And therefore 'tis call'd a sensible tale; and this
12 1978 cuff
12 1979     was but to knock at your car and beseech list'ning. Now I
12 1980 begin:
12 1981     Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind
12 1982 my
12 1983     mistress- 
12 1984   CURTIS. Both of one horse?
12 1985   GRUMIO. What's that to thee?
12 1986   CURTIS. Why, a horse.
12 1987   GRUMIO. Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross'd me, thou
12 1988     shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her
12 1989 horse;
12 1990     thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was
12 1991     bemoil'd, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he
12 1992 beat me
12 1993     because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to
12 1994     pluck him off me, how he swore, how she pray'd that never
12 1995 pray'd
12 1996     before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle
12 1997 was
12 1998     burst, how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy
12 1999 memory,
12 2000     which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return
12 2001 unexperienc'd to
12 2002     thy grave.
12 2003   CURTIS. By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
12 2004   GRUMIO. Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
12 2005 find
12 2006     when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth
12 2007     Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and
12 2008 the
12 2009     rest; let their heads be sleekly comb'd, their blue coats
12 2010 brush'd
12 2011     and their garters of an indifferent knit; let them curtsy
12 2012 with
12 2013     their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my
12 2014 master's 
12 2015     horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?
12 2016   CURTIS. They are.
12 2017   GRUMIO. Call them forth.
12 2018   CURTIS. Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master, to
12 2019 countenance my
12 2020     mistress.
12 2021   GRUMIO. Why, she hath a face of her own.
12 2022   CURTIS. Who knows not that?
12 2023   GRUMIO. Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance
12 2024 her.
12 2025   CURTIS. I call them forth to credit her.
12 2026   GRUMIO. Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
12 2027 
12 2028                      Enter four or five SERVINGMEN
12 2029 
12 2030   NATHANIEL. Welcome home, Grumio!
12 2031   PHILIP. How now, Grumio!
12 2032   JOSEPH. What, Grumio!
12 2033   NICHOLAS. Fellow Grumio!
12 2034   NATHANIEL. How now, old lad!
12 2035   GRUMIO. Welcome, you!- how now, you!- what, you!- fellow, you!-
12 2036 and
12 2037     thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all
12 2038 ready, 
12 2039     and all things neat?
12 2040   NATHANIEL. All things is ready. How near is our master?
12 2041   GRUMIO. E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not-
12 2042    Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
12 2043 
12 2044                      Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA
12 2045 
12 2046   PETRUCHIO. Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
12 2047     To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
12 2048     Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
12 2049   ALL SERVANTS. Here, here, sir; here, sir.
12 2050   PETRUCHIO. Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
12 2051     You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
12 2052     What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
12 2053     Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
12 2054   GRUMIO. Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
12 2055   PETRUCHIO. YOU peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
12 2056     Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
12 2057     And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
12 2058   GRUMIO. Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made, 
12 2059     And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel;
12 2060     There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
12 2061     And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing;
12 2062     There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
12 2063     The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
12 2064     Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
12 2065   PETRUCHIO. Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.
12 2066                                    Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN
12 2067 
12 2068     [Sings]  Where is the life that late I led?
12 2069              Where are those-
12 2070 
12 2071     Sit down, Kate, and welcome. Soud, soud, soud, soud!
12 2072 
12 2073                  Re-enter SERVANTS with supper
12 2074 
12 2075     Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
12 2076     Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
12 2077 
12 2078     [Sings]  It was the friar of orders grey, 
12 2079              As he forth walked on his way-
12 2080 
12 2081     Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry;
12 2082     Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
12 2083                                                    [Strikes him]
12 2084     Be merry, Kate. Some water, here, what, ho!
12 2085 
12 2086                       Enter one with water
12 2087 
12 2088     Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
12 2089     And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
12 2090                                                  Exit SERVINGMAN
12 2091     One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.
12 2092     Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
12 2093     Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
12 2094     You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?    [Strikes him]
12 2095   KATHERINA. Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
12 2096   PETRUCHIO. A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
12 2097     Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
12 2098     Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I? 
12 2099     What's this? Mutton?
12 2100   FIRST SERVANT. Ay.
12 2101   PETRUCHIO. Who brought it?
12 2102   PETER. I.
12 2103   PETRUCHIO. 'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
12 2104     What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?
12 2105     How durst you villains bring it from the dresser
12 2106     And serve it thus to me that love it not?
12 2107     There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
12 2108                                 [Throws the meat, etc., at them]
12 2109     You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
12 2110     What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
12 2111                                                  Exeunt SERVANTS
12 2112   KATHERINA. I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet;
12 2113     The meat was well, if you were so contented.
12 2114   PETRUCHIO. I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,
12 2115     And I expressly am forbid to touch it;
12 2116     For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
12 2117     And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
12 2118     Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric, 
12 2119     Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
12 2120     Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended.
12 2121     And for this night we'll fast for company.
12 2122     Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.        Exeunt
12 2123 
12 2124                      Re-enter SERVANTS severally
12 2125 
12 2126   NATHANIEL. Peter, didst ever see the like?
12 2127   PETER. He kills her in her own humour.
12 2128 
12 2129                             Re-enter CURTIS
12 2130 
12 2131   GRUMIO. Where is he?
12 2132   CURTIS. In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,
12 2133     And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
12 2134     Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.
12 2135     And sits as one new risen from a dream.
12 2136     Away, away! for he is coming hither.                  Exeunt
12 2137 
12 2138                        Re-enter PETRUCHIO 
12 2139 
12 2140   PETRUCHIO. Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
12 2141     And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
12 2142     My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.
12 2143     And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,
12 2144     For then she never looks upon her lure.
12 2145     Another way I have to man my haggard,
12 2146     To make her come, and know her keeper's call,
12 2147     That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
12 2148     That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.
12 2149     She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
12 2150     Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
12 2151     As with the meat, some undeserved fault
12 2152     I'll find about the making of the bed;
12 2153     And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
12 2154     This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;
12 2155     Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
12 2156     That all is done in reverend care of her-
12 2157     And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night;
12 2158     And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl 
12 2159     And with the clamour keep her still awake.
12 2160     This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,
12 2161     And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
12 2162     He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
12 2163     Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show.                Exit

12 2167 
12 2168 SCENE II.
12 2169 Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house
12 2170 
12 2171 Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO, and HORTENSIO as LICIO
12 2172 
12 2173   TRANIO. Is 't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
12 2174     Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
12 2175     I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
12 2176   HORTENSIO. Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
12 2177     Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
12 2178                                               [They stand aside]
12 2179 
12 2180                Enter BIANCA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO
12 2181 
12 2182   LUCENTIO. Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
12 2183   BIANCA. What, master, read you, First resolve me that.
12 2184   LUCENTIO. I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.'
12 2185   BIANCA. And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
12 2186   LUCENTIO. While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.
12 2187                                                    [They retire]
12 2188   HORTENSIO. Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
12 2189     You that durst swear that your Mistress Blanca 
12 2190     Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio.
12 2191   TRANIO. O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
12 2192     I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
12 2193   HORTENSIO. Mistake no more; I am not Licio.
12 2194     Nor a musician as I seem to be;
12 2195     But one that scorn to live in this disguise
12 2196     For such a one as leaves a gentleman
12 2197     And makes a god of such a cullion.
12 2198     Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
12 2199   TRANIO. Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
12 2200     Of your entire affection to Bianca;
12 2201     And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
12 2202     I will with you, if you be so contented,
12 2203     Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
12 2204   HORTENSIO. See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
12 2205     Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
12 2206     Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,
12 2207     As one unworthy all the former favours
12 2208     That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
12 2209   TRANIO. And here I take the like unfeigned oath, 
12 2210     Never to marry with her though she would entreat;
12 2211     Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!
12 2212   HORTENSIO. Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
12 2213     For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
12 2214     I will be married to a wealthy widow
12 2215     Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
12 2216     As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.
12 2217     And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
12 2218     Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
12 2219     Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
12 2220     In resolution as I swore before.                        Exit
12 2221   TRANIO. Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
12 2222     As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
12 2223     Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
12 2224     And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
12 2225   BIANCA. Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?
12 2226   TRANIO. Mistress, we have.
12 2227   LUCENTIO. Then we are rid of Licio.
12 2228   TRANIO. I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
12 2229     That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day. 
12 2230   BIANCA. God give him joy!
12 2231   TRANIO. Ay, and he'll tame her.
12 2232   BIANCA. He says so, Tranio.
12 2233   TRANIO. Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
12 2234   BIANCA. The taming-school! What, is there such a place?
12 2235   TRANIO. Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,
12 2236     That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
12 2237     To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
12 2238 
12 2239                        Enter BIONDELLO
12 2240 
12 2241   BIONDELLO. O master, master, have watch'd so long
12 2242     That I am dog-weary; but at last I spied
12 2243     An ancient angel coming down the hill
12 2244     Will serve the turn.
12 2245   TRANIO. What is he, Biondello?
12 2246   BIONDELLO. Master, a mercatante or a pedant,
12 2247     I know not what; but formal in apparel,
12 2248     In gait and countenance surely like a father.
12 2249   LUCENTIO. And what of him, Tranio? 
12 2250   TRANIO. If he be credulous and trust my tale,
12 2251     I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
12 2252     And give assurance to Baptista Minola
12 2253     As if he were the right Vincentio.
12 2254     Take in your love, and then let me alone.
12 2255                                       Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
12 2256 
12 2257                          Enter a PEDANT
12 2258 
12 2259   PEDANT. God save you, sir!
12 2260   TRANIO. And you, sir; you are welcome.
12 2261     Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
12 2262   PEDANT. Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;
12 2263     But then up farther, and as far as Rome;
12 2264     And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
12 2265   TRANIO. What countryman, I pray?
12 2266   PEDANT. Of Mantua.
12 2267   TRANIO. Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
12 2268     And come to Padua, careless of your life!
12 2269   PEDANT. My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard. 
12 2270   TRANIO. 'Tis death for any one in Mantua
12 2271     To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
12 2272     Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the Duke,
12 2273     For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,
12 2274     Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.
12 2275     'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
12 2276     You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
12 2277   PEDANT. Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so!
12 2278     For I have bills for money by exchange
12 2279     From Florence, and must here deliver them.
12 2280   TRANIO. Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
12 2281     This will I do, and this I will advise you-
12 2282     First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
12 2283   PEDANT. Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
12 2284     Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
12 2285   TRANIO. Among them know you one Vincentio?
12 2286   PEDANT. I know him not, but I have heard of him,
12 2287     A merchant of incomparable wealth.
12 2288   TRANIO. He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
12 2289     In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you. 
12 2290   BIONDELLO.  [Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster, and
12 2291 all
12 2292     one.
12 2293   TRANIO. To save your life in this extremity,
12 2294     This favour will I do you for his sake;
12 2295     And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
12 2296     That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
12 2297     His name and credit shall you undertake,
12 2298     And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd;
12 2299     Look that you take upon you as you should.
12 2300     You understand me, sir. So shall you stay
12 2301     Till you have done your business in the city.
12 2302     If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it.
12 2303   PEDANT. O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
12 2304     The patron of my life and liberty.
12 2305   TRANIO. Then go with me to make the matter good.
12 2306     This, by the way, I let you understand:
12 2307     My father is here look'd for every day
12 2308     To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage
12 2309     'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
12 2310     In all these circumstances I'll instruct you. 
12 2311     Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.              Exeunt
12 2312 
12 2313 
12 2314 
12 2315 
12 2316 SCENE III.
12 2317 PETRUCHIO'S house
12 2318 
12 2319 Enter KATHERINA and GRUMIO
12 2320 
12 2321   GRUMIO. No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
12 2322   KATHERINA. The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
12 2323     What, did he marry me to famish me?
12 2324     Beggars that come unto my father's door
12 2325     Upon entreaty have a present alms;
12 2326     If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
12 2327     But I, who never knew how to entreat,
12 2328     Nor never needed that I should entreat,
12 2329     Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
12 2330     With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;
12 2331     And that which spites me more than all these wants-
12 2332     He does it under name of perfect love;
12 2333     As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
12 2334     'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
12 2335     I prithee go and get me some repast;
12 2336     I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
12 2337   GRUMIO. What say you to a neat's foot? 
12 2338   KATHERINA. 'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.
12 2339   GRUMIO. I fear it is too choleric a meat.
12 2340     How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
12 2341   KATHERINA. I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.
12 2342   GRUMIO. I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
12 2343     What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
12 2344   KATHERINA. A dish that I do love to feed upon.
12 2345   GRUMIO. Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
12 2346   KATHERINA. Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.
12 2347   GRUMIO. Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,
12 2348     Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
12 2349   KATHERINA. Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.
12 2350   GRUMIO. Why then the mustard without the beef.
12 2351   KATHERINA. Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
12 2352                                                      [Beats him]
12 2353     That feed'st me with the very name of meat.
12 2354     Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
12 2355     That triumph thus upon my misery!
12 2356     Go, get thee gone, I say.
12 2357  
12 2358                Enter PETRUCHIO, and HORTENSIO with meat
12 2359 
12 2360   PETRUCHIO. How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
12 2361   HORTENSIO. Mistress, what cheer?
12 2362   KATHERINA. Faith, as cold as can be.
12 2363   PETRUCHIO. Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.
12 2364     Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
12 2365     To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee.
12 2366     I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
12 2367     What, not a word? Nay, then thou lov'st it not,
12 2368     And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
12 2369     Here, take away this dish.
12 2370   KATHERINA. I pray you, let it stand.
12 2371   PETRUCHIO. The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
12 2372     And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
12 2373   KATHERINA. I thank you, sir.
12 2374   HORTENSIO. Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
12 2375     Come, Mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
12 2376   PETRUCHIO.  [Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest
12 2377 me.-
12 2378     Much good do it unto thy gentle heart! 
12 2379     Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
12 2380     Will we return unto thy father's house
12 2381     And revel it as bravely as the best,
12 2382     With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,
12 2383     With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,
12 2384     With scarfs and fans and double change of brav'ry.
12 2385     With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.
12 2386     What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,
12 2387     To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
12 2388 
12 2389                           Enter TAILOR
12 2390 
12 2391     Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
12 2392     Lay forth the gown.
12 2393 
12 2394                         Enter HABERDASHER
12 2395 
12 2396     What news with you, sir?
12 2397   HABERDASHER. Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
12 2398   PETRUCHIO. Why, this was moulded on a porringer; 
12 2399     A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
12 2400     Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
12 2401     A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
12 2402     Away with it. Come, let me have a bigger.
12 2403   KATHERINA. I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
12 2404     And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
12 2405   PETRUCHIO. When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
12 2406     And not till then.
12 2407   HORTENSIO.  [Aside]  That will not be in haste.
12 2408   KATHERINA. Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
12 2409     And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.
12 2410     Your betters have endur'd me say my mind,
12 2411     And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
12 2412     My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
12 2413     Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
12 2414     And rather than it shall, I will be free
12 2415     Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
12 2416   PETRUCHIO. Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
12 2417     A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
12 2418     I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not. 
12 2419   KATHERINA. Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
12 2420     And it I will have, or I will have none.    Exit HABERDASHER
12 2421   PETRUCHIO. Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see't.
12 2422     O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
12 2423     What's this? A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon.
12 2424     What, up and down, carv'd like an appletart?
12 2425     Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
12 2426     Like to a censer in a barber's shop.
12 2427     Why, what a devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
12 2428   HORTENSIO.  [Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor
12 2429 gown.
12 2430   TAILOR. You bid me make it orderly and well,
12 2431     According to the fashion and the time.
12 2432   PETRUCHIO. Marry, and did; but if you be rememb'red,
12 2433     I did not bid you mar it to the time.
12 2434     Go, hop me over every kennel home,
12 2435     For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
12 2436     I'll none of it; hence! make your best of it.
12 2437   KATHERINA. I never saw a better fashion'd gown,
12 2438     More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;
12 2439     Belike you mean to make a puppet of me. 
12 2440   PETRUCHIO. Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
12 2441   TAILOR. She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.
12 2442   PETRUCHIO. O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou
12 2443       thimble,
12 2444     Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,
12 2445     Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou-
12 2446     Brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!
12 2447     Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
12 2448     Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard
12 2449     As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st!
12 2450     I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
12 2451   TAILOR. Your worship is deceiv'd; the gown is made
12 2452     Just as my master had direction.
12 2453     Grumio gave order how it should be done.
12 2454   GRUMIO. I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
12 2455   TAILOR. But how did you desire it should be made?
12 2456   GRUMIO. Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
12 2457   TAILOR. But did you not request to have it cut?
12 2458   GRUMIO. Thou hast fac'd many things.
12 2459   TAILOR. I have. 
12 2460   GRUMIO. Face not me. Thou hast brav'd many men; brave not me. I
12 2461     will neither be fac'd nor brav'd. I say unto thee, I bid thy
12 2462     master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to
12 2463 pieces.
12 2464     Ergo, thou liest.
12 2465   TAILOR. Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
12 2466   PETRUCHIO. Read it.
12 2467   GRUMIO. The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
12 2468   TAILOR.  [Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-
12 2469   GRUMIO. Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the
12 2470     skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown
12 2471 bread; I
12 2472     said a gown.
12 2473   PETRUCHIO. Proceed.
12 2474   TAILOR.  [Reads]  'With a small compass'd cape'-
12 2475   GRUMIO. I confess the cape.
12 2476   TAILOR.  [Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve'-
12 2477   GRUMIO. I confess two sleeves.
12 2478   TAILOR.  [Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
12 2479   PETRUCHIO. Ay, there's the villainy.
12 2480   GRUMIO. Error i' th' bill, sir; error i' th' bill! I commanded
12 2481 the
12 2482     sleeves should be cut out, and sew'd up again; and that I'll 
12 2483     prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a
12 2484 thimble.
12 2485   TAILOR. This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where,
12 2486 thou
12 2487     shouldst know it.
12 2488   GRUMIO. I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy
12 2489     meteyard, and spare not me.
12 2490   HORTENSIO. God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.
12 2491   PETRUCHIO. Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
12 2492   GRUMIO. You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.
12 2493   PETRUCHIO. Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
12 2494   GRUMIO. Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress' gown
12 2495 for
12 2496     thy master's use!
12 2497   PETRUCHIO. Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
12 2498   GRUMIO. O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.
12 2499     Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
12 2500     O fie, fie, fie!
12 2501   PETRUCHIO.  [Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor
12 2502 paid.-
12 2503     Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
12 2504   HORTENSIO. Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow;
12 2505     Take no unkindness of his hasty words.
12 2506     Away, I say; commend me to thy master.           Exit TAILOR 
12 2507   PETRUCHIO. Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
12 2508     Even in these honest mean habiliments;
12 2509     Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
12 2510     For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
12 2511     And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
12 2512     So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
12 2513     What, is the jay more precious than the lark
12 2514     Because his feathers are more beautiful?
12 2515     Or is the adder better than the eel
12 2516     Because his painted skin contents the eye?
12 2517     O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
12 2518     For this poor furniture and mean array.
12 2519     If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;
12 2520     And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
12 2521     To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
12 2522     Go call my men, and let us straight to him;
12 2523     And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
12 2524     There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
12 2525     Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
12 2526     And well we may come there by dinner-time. 
12 2527   KATHERINA. I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,
12 2528     And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
12 2529   PETRUCHIO. It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
12 2530     Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
12 2531     You are still crossing it. Sirs, let 't alone;
12 2532     I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
12 2533     It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
12 2534   HORTENSIO. Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
12 2535                                                           Exeunt

12 2540 SCENE IV.
12 2541 Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house
12 2542 
12 2543 Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO, and the PEDANT dressed like VINCENTIO
12 2544 
12 2545   TRANIO. Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?
12 2546   PEDANT. Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,
12 2547     Signior Baptista may remember me
12 2548     Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
12 2549     Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
12 2550   TRANIO. 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
12 2551     With such austerity as longeth to a father.
12 2552 
12 2553                        Enter BIONDELLO
12 2554 
12 2555   PEDANT. I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
12 2556     'Twere good he were school'd.
12 2557   TRANIO. Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
12 2558     Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
12 2559     Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
12 2560   BIONDELLO. Tut, fear not me. 
12 2561   TRANIO. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
12 2562   BIONDELLO. I told him that your father was at Venice,
12 2563     And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
12 2564   TRANIO. Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
12 2565     Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
12 2566 
12 2567                  Enter BAPTISTA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO
12 2568 
12 2569     Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
12 2570     [To the PEDANT] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of;
12 2571     I pray you stand good father to me now;
12 2572     Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
12 2573   PEDANT. Soft, son!
12 2574     Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
12 2575     To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
12 2576     Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
12 2577     Of love between your daughter and himself;
12 2578     And- for the good report I hear of you,
12 2579     And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
12 2580     And she to him- to stay him not too long, 
12 2581     I am content, in a good father's care,
12 2582     To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
12 2583     No worse than I, upon some agreement
12 2584     Me shall you find ready and willing
12 2585     With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
12 2586     For curious I cannot be with you,
12 2587     Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
12 2588   BAPTISTA. Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
12 2589     Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
12 2590     Right true it is your son Lucentio here
12 2591     Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
12 2592     Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
12 2593     And therefore, if you say no more than this,
12 2594     That like a father you will deal with him,
12 2595     And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
12 2596     The match is made, and all is done-
12 2597     Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
12 2598   TRANIO. I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
12 2599     We be affied, and such assurance ta'en
12 2600     As shall with either part's agreement stand? 
12 2601   BAPTISTA. Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
12 2602     Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;
12 2603     Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,
12 2604     And happily we might be interrupted.
12 2605   TRANIO. Then at my lodging, an it like you.
12 2606     There doth my father lie; and there this night
12 2607     We'll pass the business privately and well.
12 2608     Send for your daughter by your servant here;
12 2609     My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
12 2610     The worst is this, that at so slender warning
12 2611     You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
12 2612   BAPTISTA. It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
12 2613     And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
12 2614     And, if you will, tell what hath happened-
12 2615     Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,
12 2616     And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.      Exit LUCENTIO
12 2617   BIONDELLO. I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
12 2618   TRANIO. Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
12 2619                                                   Exit BIONDELLO
12 2620     Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way? 
12 2621     Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer;
12 2622     Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
12 2623   BAPTISTA. I follow you.                                 Exeunt
12 2624 
12 2625             Re-enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, and BIONDELLO
12 2626 
12 2627   BIONDELLO. Cambio.
12 2628   LUCENTIO. What say'st thou, Biondello?
12 2629   BIONDELLO. You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
12 2630   LUCENTIO. Biondello, what of that?
12 2631   BIONDELLO. Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to
12 2632 expound
12 2633     the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
12 2634   LUCENTIO. I pray thee moralize them.
12 2635   BIONDELLO. Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the
12 2636 deceiving
12 2637     father of a deceitful son.
12 2638   LUCENTIO. And what of him?
12 2639   BIONDELLO. His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
12 2640   LUCENTIO. And then?
12 2641   BIONDELLO. The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your
12 2642 command
12 2643     at all hours. 
12 2644   LUCENTIO. And what of all this?
12 2645   BIONDELLO. I cannot tell, except they are busied about a
12 2646     counterfeit assurance. Take your assurance of her, cum
12 2647 privilegio
12 2648     ad imprimendum solum; to th' church take the priest, clerk,
12 2649 and
12 2650     some sufficient honest witnesses.
12 2651     If this be not that you look for, I have more to say,
12 2652     But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.
12 2653   LUCENTIO. Hear'st thou, Biondello?
12 2654   BIONDELLO. I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an
12 2655 afternoon
12 2656     as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and
12 2657 so
12 2658     may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me
12 2659 to
12 2660     go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against
12 2661 you
12 2662     come with your appendix.
12 2663  Exit
12 2664   LUCENTIO. I may and will, if she be so contented.
12 2665     She will be pleas'd; then wherefore should I doubt?
12 2666     Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her;
12 2667     It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.              Exit

12 2675 Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and SERVANTS
12 2676 
12 2677   PETRUCHIO. Come on, a God's name; once more toward our
12 2678 father's.
12 2679     Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
12 2680   KATHERINA. The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.
12 2681   PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
12 2682   KATHERINA. I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
12 2683   PETRUCHIO. Now by my mother's son, and that's myself,
12 2684     It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
12 2685     Or ere I journey to your father's house.
12 2686     Go on and fetch our horses back again.
12 2687     Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
12 2688   HORTENSIO. Say as he says, or we shall never go.
12 2689   KATHERINA. Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
12 2690     And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;
12 2691     And if you please to call it a rush-candle,
12 2692     Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
12 2693   PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon.
12 2694   KATHERINA. I know it is the moon. 
12 2695   PETRUCHIO. Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.
12 2696   KATHERINA. Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun;
12 2697     But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
12 2698     And the moon changes even as your mind.
12 2699     What you will have it nam'd, even that it is,
12 2700     And so it shall be so for Katherine.
12 2701   HORTENSIO. Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.
12 2702   PETRUCHIO. Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
12 2703     And not unluckily against the bias.
12 2704     But, soft! Company is coming here.
12 2705 
12 2706                             Enter VINCENTIO
12 2707 
12 2708     [To VINCENTIO]  Good-morrow, gentle mistress; where away?-
12 2709     Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
12 2710     Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
12 2711     Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
12 2712     What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
12 2713     As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
12 2714     Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee. 
12 2715     Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
12 2716   HORTENSIO. 'A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
12 2717   KATHERINA. Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
12 2718     Whither away, or where is thy abode?
12 2719     Happy the parents of so fair a child;
12 2720     Happier the man whom favourable stars
12 2721     Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.
12 2722   PETRUCHIO. Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad!
12 2723     This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,
12 2724     And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
12 2725   KATHERINA. Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
12 2726     That have been so bedazzled with the sun
12 2727     That everything I look on seemeth green;
12 2728     Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.
12 2729     Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
12 2730   PETRUCHIO. Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
12 2731     Which way thou travellest- if along with us,
12 2732     We shall be joyful of thy company.
12 2733   VINCENTIO. Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
12 2734     That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me, 
12 2735     My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
12 2736     And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
12 2737     A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
12 2738   PETRUCHIO. What is his name?
12 2739   VINCENTIO. Lucentio, gentle sir.
12 2740   PETRUCHIO. Happily met; the happier for thy son.
12 2741     And now by law, as well as reverend age,
12 2742     I may entitle thee my loving father:
12 2743     The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
12 2744     Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
12 2745     Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
12 2746     Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
12 2747     Beside, so qualified as may beseem
12 2748     The spouse of any noble gentleman.
12 2749     Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
12 2750     And wander we to see thy honest son,
12 2751     Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
12 2752   VINCENTIO. But is this true; or is it else your pleasure,
12 2753     Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
12 2754     Upon the company you overtake? 
12 2755   HORTENSIO. I do assure thee, father, so it is.
12 2756   PETRUCHIO. Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
12 2757     For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
12 2758                                         Exeunt all but HORTENSIO
12 2759   HORTENSIO. Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
12 2760     Have to my widow; and if she be froward,
12 2761     Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.         Exit

12 2777 ACT V. SCENE I.
12 2778 Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house
12 2779 
12 2780 Enter BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA; GREMIO is out before
12 2781 
12 2782   BIONDELLO. Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.
12 2783   LUCENTIO. I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need thee at
12 2784     home, therefore leave us.
12 2785   BIONDELLO. Nay, faith, I'll see the church a your back, and
12 2786 then
12 2787     come back to my master's as soon as I can.
12 2788                           Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO
12 2789   GREMIO. I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
12 2790 
12 2791            Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO,
12 2792                           and ATTENDANTS
12 2793 
12 2794   PETRUCHIO. Sir, here's the door; this is Lucentio's house;
12 2795     My father's bears more toward the market-place;
12 2796     Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
12 2797   VINCENTIO. You shall not choose but drink before you go;
12 2798     I think I shall command your welcome here, 
12 2799     And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.         [Knocks]
12 2800   GREMIO. They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
12 2801                                 [PEDANT looks out of the window]
12 2802   PEDANT. What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
12 2803   VINCENTIO. Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
12 2804   PEDANT. He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
12 2805   VINCENTIO. What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to
12 2806 make
12 2807     merry withal?
12 2808   PEDANT. Keep your hundred pounds to yourself; he shall need
12 2809 none so
12 2810     long as I live.
12 2811   PETRUCHIO. Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
12 2812 Do
12 2813     you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you
12 2814 tell
12 2815     Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is
12 2816 here
12 2817     at the door to speak with him.
12 2818   PEDANT. Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here
12 2819 looking
12 2820     out at the window.
12 2821   VINCENTIO. Art thou his father?
12 2822   PEDANT. Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
12 2823   PETRUCHIO.  [To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman!
12 2824     Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's
12 2825 name. 
12 2826   PEDANT. Lay hands on the villain; I believe 'a means to cozen
12 2827     somebody in this city under my countenance.
12 2828 
12 2829                        Re-enter BIONDELLO
12 2830 
12 2831   BIONDELLO. I have seen them in the church together. God send
12 2832 'em
12 2833     good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master, Vicentio!
12 2834 Now we
12 2835     are undone and brought to nothing.
12 2836   VINCENTIO.  [Seeing BIONDELLO]  Come hither, crack-hemp.
12 2837   BIONDELLO. I hope I may choose, sir.
12 2838   VINCENTIO. Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
12 2839   BIONDELLO. Forgot you! No, sir. I could not forget you, for I
12 2840 never
12 2841     saw you before in all my life.
12 2842   VINCENTIO. What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
12 2843 thy
12 2844     master's father, Vincentio?
12 2845   BIONDELLO. What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir;
12 2846 see
12 2847     where he looks out of the window.
12 2848   VINCENTIO. Is't so, indeed?               [He beats BIONDELLO]
12 2849   BIONDELLO. Help, help, help! Here's a madman will murder me.
12 2850  Exit 
12 2851   PEDANT. Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!     Exit from above
12 2852   PETRUCHIO. Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
12 2853 this
12 2854     controversy.                              [They stand aside]
12 2855 
12 2856        Re-enter PEDANT below; BAPTISTA, TRANIO, and SERVANTS
12 2857 
12 2858   TRANIO. Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
12 2859   VINCENTIO. What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
12 2860 gods!
12 2861     O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet
12 2862 cloak,
12 2863     and a copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! While I play
12 2864 the
12 2865     good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the
12 2866     university.
12 2867   TRANIO. How now! what's the matter?
12 2868   BAPTISTA. What, is the man lunatic?
12 2869   TRANIO. Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit,
12 2870 but
12 2871     your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if
12 2872 I
12 2873     wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to
12 2874     maintain it.
12 2875   VINCENTIO. Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
12 2876   BAPTISTA. You mistake, sir; you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you
12 2877 
12 2878     think is his name?
12 2879   VINCENTIO. His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought
12 2880 him
12 2881     up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
12 2882   PEDANT. Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is
12 2883 mine
12 2884     only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vicentio.
12 2885   VINCENTIO. Lucentio! O, he hath murd'red his master! Lay hold
12 2886 on
12 2887     him, I charge you, in the Duke's name. O, my son, my son!
12 2888 Tell
12 2889     me, thou villain, where is my son, Lucentio?
12 2890   TRANIO. Call forth an officer.
12 2891 
12 2892                       Enter one with an OFFICER
12 2893 
12 2894     Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge
12 2895 you
12 2896     see that he be forthcoming.
12 2897   VINCENTIO. Carry me to the gaol!
12 2898   GREMIO. Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.
12 2899   BAPTISTA. Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to
12 2900 prison.
12 2901   GREMIO. Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catch'd
12 2902 in
12 2903     this business; I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.
12 2904   PEDANT. Swear if thou dar'st. 
12 2905   GREMIO. Nay, I dare not swear it.
12 2906   TRANIO. Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
12 2907   GREMIO. Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
12 2908   BAPTISTA. Away with the dotard; to the gaol with him!
12 2909   VINCENTIO. Thus strangers may be hal'd and abus'd. O monstrous
12 2910     villain!
12 2911 
12 2912           Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA
12 2913 
12 2914   BIONDELLO. O, we are spoil'd; and yonder he is! Deny him,
12 2915 forswear
12 2916     him, or else we are all undone.
12 2917          Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and PEDANT, as fast as may be
12 2918   LUCENTIO.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.
12 2919   VINCENTIO. Lives my sweet son?
12 2920   BIANCA. Pardon, dear father.
12 2921   BAPTISTA. How hast thou offended?
12 2922     Where is Lucentio?
12 2923   LUCENTIO. Here's Lucentio,
12 2924     Right son to the right Vincentio,
12 2925     That have by marriage made thy daughter mine, 
12 2926     While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne.
12 2927   GREMIO. Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
12 2928   VINCENTIO. Where is that damned villain, Tranio,
12 2929     That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so?
12 2930   BAPTISTA. Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
12 2931   BIANCA. Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.
12 2932   LUCENTIO. Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
12 2933     Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
12 2934     While he did bear my countenance in the town;
12 2935     And happily I have arrived at the last
12 2936     Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
12 2937     What Tranio did, myself enforc'd him to;
12 2938     Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
12 2939   VINCENTIO. I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me
12 2940 to
12 2941     the gaol.
12 2942   BAPTISTA.  [To LUCENTIO]  But do you hear, sir? Have you
12 2943 married my
12 2944     daughter without asking my good will?
12 2945   VINCENTIO. Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but
12 2946 I
12 2947     will in to be revenged for this villainy.               Exit
12 2948   BAPTISTA. And I to sound the depth of this knavery.       Exit 
12 2949   LUCENTIO. Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
12 2950                                       Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
12 2951   GREMIO. My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest;
12 2952     Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.           Exit
12 2953   KATHERINA. Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.
12 2954   PETRUCHIO. First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
12 2955   KATHERINA. What, in the midst of the street?
12 2956   PETRUCHIO. What, art thou asham'd of me?
12 2957   KATHERINA. No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
12 2958   PETRUCHIO. Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's
12 2959 away.
12 2960   KATHERINA. Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love,
12 2961 stay.
12 2962   PETRUCHIO. Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
12 2963     Better once than never, for never too late.           Exeunt
12 2964 
12 2965 
12 2966 
12 2967 
12 2968 SCENE II.
12 2969 LUCENTIO'S house
12 2970 
12 2971 Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the PEDANT, LUCENTIO, BIANCA,
12 2972 PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and WIDOW. The SERVINGMEN with
12 2973 TRANIO,
12 2974 BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO, bringing in a banquet
12 2975 
12 2976   LUCENTIO. At last, though long, our jarring notes agree;
12 2977     And time it is when raging war is done
12 2978     To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
12 2979     My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
12 2980     While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
12 2981     Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,
12 2982     And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
12 2983     Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.
12 2984     My banquet is to close our stomachs up
12 2985     After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
12 2986     For now we sit to chat as well as eat.            [They sit]
12 2987   PETRUCHIO. Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
12 2988   BAPTISTA. Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
12 2989   PETRUCHIO. Padua affords nothing but what is kind. 
12 2990   HORTENSIO. For both our sakes I would that word were true.
12 2991   PETRUCHIO. Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
12 2992   WIDOW. Then never trust me if I be afeard.
12 2993   PETRUCHIO. YOU are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
12 2994     I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.
12 2995   WIDOW. He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
12 2996   PETRUCHIO. Roundly replied.
12 2997   KATHERINA. Mistress, how mean you that?
12 2998   WIDOW. Thus I conceive by him.
12 2999   PETRUCHIO. Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
12 3000   HORTENSIO. My widow says thus she conceives her tale.
12 3001   PETRUCHIO. Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
12 3002   KATHERINA. 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.'
12 3003     I pray you tell me what you meant by that.
12 3004   WIDOW. Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
12 3005     Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe;
12 3006     And now you know my meaning.
12 3007   KATHERINA. A very mean meaning.
12 3008   WIDOW. Right, I mean you.
12 3009   KATHERINA. And I am mean, indeed, respecting you. 
12 3010   PETRUCHIO. To her, Kate!
12 3011   HORTENSIO. To her, widow!
12 3012   PETRUCHIO. A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
12 3013   HORTENSIO. That's my office.
12 3014   PETRUCHIO. Spoke like an officer- ha' to thee, lad.
12 3015                                            [Drinks to HORTENSIO]
12 3016   BAPTISTA. How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
12 3017   GREMIO. Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
12 3018   BIANCA. Head and butt! An hasty-witted body
12 3019     Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
12 3020   VINCENTIO. Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
12 3021   BIANCA. Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
12 3022   PETRUCHIO. Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,
12 3023     Have at you for a bitter jest or two.
12 3024   BIANCA. Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
12 3025     And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
12 3026     You are welcome all.
12 3027                              Exeunt BIANCA, KATHERINA, and WIDOW
12 3028   PETRUCHIO. She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,
12 3029     This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not; 
12 3030     Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
12 3031   TRANIO. O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
12 3032     Which runs himself, and catches for his master.
12 3033   PETRUCHIO. A good swift simile, but something currish.
12 3034   TRANIO. 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;
12 3035     'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
12 3036   BAPTISTA. O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
12 3037   LUCENTIO. I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
12 3038   HORTENSIO. Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?
12 3039   PETRUCHIO. 'A has a little gall'd me, I confess;
12 3040     And, as the jest did glance away from me,
12 3041     'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
12 3042   BAPTISTA. Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
12 3043     I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
12 3044   PETRUCHIO. Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,
12 3045     Let's each one send unto his wife,
12 3046     And he whose wife is most obedient,
12 3047     To come at first when he doth send for her,
12 3048     Shall win the wager which we will propose.
12 3049   HORTENSIO. Content. What's the wager? 
12 3050   LUCENTIO. Twenty crowns.
12 3051   PETRUCHIO. Twenty crowns?
12 3052     I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
12 3053     But twenty times so much upon my wife.
12 3054   LUCENTIO. A hundred then.
12 3055   HORTENSIO. Content.
12 3056   PETRUCHIO. A match! 'tis done.
12 3057   HORTENSIO. Who shall begin?
12 3058   LUCENTIO. That will I.
12 3059     Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
12 3060   BIONDELLO. I go.                                          Exit
12 3061   BAPTISTA. Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.
12 3062   LUCENTIO. I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
12 3063 
12 3064                           Re-enter BIONDELLO
12 3065 
12 3066     How now! what news?
12 3067   BIONDELLO. Sir, my mistress sends you word
12 3068     That she is busy and she cannot come.
12 3069   PETRUCHIO. How! She's busy, and she cannot come! 
12 3070     Is that an answer?
12 3071   GREMIO. Ay, and a kind one too.
12 3072     Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
12 3073   PETRUCHIO. I hope better.
12 3074   HORTENSIO. Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
12 3075     To come to me forthwith.                      Exit BIONDELLO
12 3076   PETRUCHIO. O, ho! entreat her!
12 3077     Nay, then she must needs come.
12 3078   HORTENSIO. I am afraid, sir,
12 3079     Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
12 3080 
12 3081                             Re-enter BIONDELLO
12 3082 
12 3083     Now, where's my wife?
12 3084   BIONDELLO. She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
12 3085     She will not come; she bids you come to her.
12 3086   PETRUCHIO. Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
12 3087     Intolerable, not to be endur'd!
12 3088     Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
12 3089     Say I command her come to me.                    Exit GRUMIO 
12 3090   HORTENSIO. I know her answer.
12 3091   PETRUCHIO. What?
12 3092   HORTENSIO. She will not.
12 3093   PETRUCHIO. The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
12 3094 
12 3095                              Re-enter KATHERINA
12 3096 
12 3097   BAPTISTA. Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!
12 3098   KATHERINA. What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
12 3099   PETRUCHIO. Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
12 3100   KATHERINA. They sit conferring by the parlour fire.
12 3101   PETRUCHIO. Go, fetch them hither; if they deny to come.
12 3102     Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
12 3103     Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
12 3104                                                   Exit KATHERINA
12 3105   LUCENTIO. Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
12 3106   HORTENSIO. And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.
12 3107   PETRUCHIO. Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
12 3108     An awful rule, and right supremacy;
12 3109     And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy. 
12 3110   BAPTISTA. Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
12 3111     The wager thou hast won; and I will ad
12 3112     Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
12 3113     Another dowry to another daughter,
12 3114     For she is chang'd, as she had never been.
12 3115   PETRUCHIO. Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
12 3116     And show more sign of her obedience,
12 3117     Her new-built virtue and obedience.
12 3118 
12 3119                  Re-enter KATHERINA with BIANCA and WIDOW
12 3120 
12 3121     See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
12 3122     As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
12 3123     Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:
12 3124     Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
12 3125                                             [KATHERINA complies]
12 3126   WIDOW. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
12 3127     Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
12 3128   BIANCA. Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
12 3129   LUCENTIO. I would your duty were as foolish too; 
12 3130     The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
12 3131     Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!
12 3132   BIANCA. The more fool you for laying on my duty.
12 3133   PETRUCHIO. Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong
12 3134 women
12 3135     What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
12 3136   WIDOW. Come, come, you're mocking; we will have no telling.
12 3137   PETRUCHIO. Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
12 3138   WIDOW. She shall not.
12 3139   PETRUCHIO. I say she shall. And first begin with her.
12 3140   KATHERINA. Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
12 3141     And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
12 3142     To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.
12 3143     It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
12 3144     Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
12 3145     And in no sense is meet or amiable.
12 3146     A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
12 3147     Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
12 3148     And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
12 3149     Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
12 3150     Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper, 
12 3151     Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
12 3152     And for thy maintenance commits his body
12 3153     To painful labour both by sea and land,
12 3154     To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
12 3155     Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
12 3156     And craves no other tribute at thy hands
12 3157     But love, fair looks, and true obedience-
12 3158     Too little payment for so great a debt.
12 3159     Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
12 3160     Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
12 3161     And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
12 3162     And not obedient to his honest will,
12 3163     What is she but a foul contending rebel
12 3164     And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
12 3165     I am asham'd that women are so simple
12 3166     To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
12 3167     Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
12 3168     When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
12 3169     Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
12 3170     Unapt to toll and trouble in the world, 
12 3171     But that our soft conditions and our hearts
12 3172     Should well agree with our external parts?
12 3173     Come, come, you froward and unable worins!
12 3174     My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
12 3175     My heart as great, my reason haply more,
12 3176     To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
12 3177     But now I see our lances are but straws,
12 3178     Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
12 3179     That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
12 3180     Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
12 3181     And place your hands below your husband's foot;
12 3182     In token of which duty, if he please,
12 3183     My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
12 3184   PETRUCHIO. Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
12 3185   LUCENTIO. Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
12 3186   VINCENTIO. 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
12 3187   LUCENTIO. But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
12 3188   PETRUCHIO. Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
12 3189     We three are married, but you two are sped.
12 3190     [To LUCENTIO]  'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the
12 3191 white; 
12 3192     And being a winner, God give you good night!
12 3193                                   Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA
12 3194   HORTENSIO. Now go thy ways; thou hast tam'd a curst shrow.
12 3195   LUCENTIO. 'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam'd so.
12 3196                                                           Exeunt
