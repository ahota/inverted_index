0 0 The Tragedie of Julius Caesar
0 1 
0 2 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
0 3 
0 4 Enter Flauius, Murellus, and certaine Commoners ouer the Stage.
0 5 
0 6   Flauius. Hence: home you idle Creatures, get you home:
0 7 Is this a Holiday? What, know you not
0 8 (Being Mechanicall) you ought not walke
0 9 Vpon a labouring day, without the signe
0 10 Of your Profession? Speake, what Trade art thou?
0 11   Car. Why Sir, a Carpenter
0 12 
0 13    Mur. Where is thy Leather Apron, and thy Rule?
0 14 What dost thou with thy best Apparrell on?
0 15 You sir, what Trade are you?
0 16   Cobl. Truely Sir, in respect of a fine Workman, I am
0 17 but as you would say, a Cobler
0 18 
0 19    Mur. But what Trade art thou? Answer me directly
0 20 
0 21    Cob. A Trade Sir, that I hope I may vse, with a safe
0 22 Conscience, which is indeed Sir, a Mender of bad soules
0 23 
0 24    Fla. What Trade thou knaue? Thou naughty knaue,
0 25 what Trade?
0 26   Cobl. Nay I beseech you Sir, be not out with me: yet
0 27 if you be out Sir, I can mend you
0 28 
0 29    Mur. What mean'st thou by that? Mend mee, thou
0 30 sawcy Fellow?
0 31   Cob. Why sir, Cobble you
0 32 
0 33    Fla. Thou art a Cobler, art thou?
0 34   Cob. Truly sir, all that I liue by, is with the Aule: I
0 35 meddle with no Tradesmans matters, nor womens matters;
0 36 but withal I am indeed Sir, a Surgeon to old shooes:
0 37 when they are in great danger, I recouer them. As proper
0 38 men as euer trod vpon Neats Leather, haue gone vpon
0 39 my handy-worke
0 40 
0 41    Fla. But wherefore art not in thy Shop to day?
0 42 Why do'st thou leade these men about the streets?
0 43   Cob. Truly sir, to weare out their shooes, to get my
0 44 selfe into more worke. But indeede sir, we make Holyday
0 45 to see Caesar, and to reioyce in his Triumph
0 46 
0 47    Mur. Wherefore reioyce?
0 48 What Conquest brings he home?
0 49 What Tributaries follow him to Rome,
0 50 To grace in Captiue bonds his Chariot Wheeles?
0 51 You Blockes, you stones, you worse then senslesse things:
0 52 O you hard hearts, you cruell men of Rome,
0 53 Knew you not Pompey many a time and oft?
0 54 Haue you climb'd vp to Walles and Battlements,
0 55 To Towres and Windowes? Yea, to Chimney tops,
0 56 Your Infants in your Armes, and there haue sate
0 57 The liue-long day, with patient expectation,
0 58 To see great Pompey passe the streets of Rome:
0 59 And when you saw his Chariot but appeare,
0 60 Haue you not made an Vniuersall shout,
0 61 That Tyber trembled vnderneath her bankes
0 62 To heare the replication of your sounds,
0 63 Made in her Concaue Shores?
0 64 And do you now put on your best attyre?
0 65 And do you now cull out a Holyday?
0 66 And do you now strew Flowers in his way,
0 67 That comes in Triumph ouer Pompeyes blood?
0 68 Be gone,
0 69 Runne to your houses, fall vpon your knees,
0 70 Pray to the Gods to intermit the plague
0 71 That needs must light on this Ingratitude
0 72 
0 73    Fla. Go, go, good Countrymen, and for this fault
0 74 Assemble all the poore men of your sort;
0 75 Draw them to Tyber bankes, and weepe your teares
0 76 Into the Channell, till the lowest streame
0 77 Do kisse the most exalted Shores of all.
0 78 
0 79 Exeunt. all the Commoners.
0 80 
0 81 See where their basest mettle be not mou'd,
0 82 They vanish tongue-tyed in their guiltinesse:
0 83 Go you downe that way towards the Capitoll,
0 84 This way will I: Disrobe the Images,
0 85 If you do finde them deckt with Ceremonies
0 86 
0 87    Mur. May we do so?
0 88 You know it is the Feast of Lupercall
0 89 
0 90    Fla. It is no matter, let no Images
0 91 Be hung with Caesars Trophees: Ile about,
0 92 And driue away the Vulgar from the streets;
0 93 So do you too, where you perceiue them thicke.
0 94 These growing Feathers, pluckt from Caesars wing,
0 95 Will make him flye an ordinary pitch,
0 96 Who else would soare aboue the view of men,
0 97 And keepe vs all in seruile fearefulnesse.
0 98 
0 99 Exeunt.
0 100 
0 101 Enter Caesar, Antony for the Course, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius,
0 102 Cicero,
0 103 Brutus, Cassius, Caska, a Soothsayer: after them Murellus and
0 104 Flauius.
0 105 
0 106   Caes. Calphurnia
0 107 
0 108    Cask. Peace ho, Caesar speakes
0 109 
0 110    Caes. Calphurnia
0 111 
0 112    Calp. Heere my Lord
0 113 
0 114    Caes. Stand you directly in Antonio's way,
0 115 When he doth run his course. Antonio
0 116 
0 117    Ant. Cæsar, my Lord
0 118 
0 119    Caes. Forget not in your speed Antonio,
0 120 To touch Calphurnia: for our Elders say,
0 121 The Barren touched in this holy chace,
0 122 Shake off their sterrile curse
0 123 
0 124    Ant. I shall remember,
0 125 When Caesar sayes, Do this; it is perform'd
0 126 
0 127    Caes. Set on, and leaue no Ceremony out
0 128 
0 129    Sooth. Caesar
0 130 
0 131    Caes. Ha? Who calles?
0 132   Cask. Bid euery noyse be still: peace yet againe
0 133 
0 134    Caes. Who is it in the presse, that calles on me?
0 135 I heare a Tongue shriller then all the Musicke
0 136 Cry, Caesar: Speake, Caesar is turn'd to heare
0 137 
0 138    Sooth. Beware the Ides of March
0 139 
0 140    Caes. What man is that?
0 141   Br. A Sooth-sayer bids you beware the Ides of March
0 142   Caes. Set him before me, let me see his face
0 143 
0 144    Cassi. Fellow, come from the throng, look vpon Caesar
0 145 
0 146    Caes. What sayst thou to me now? Speak once againe,
0 147   Sooth. Beware the Ides of March
0 148 
0 149    Caes. He is a Dreamer, let vs leaue him: Passe.
0 150 
0 151 Sennet
0 152 
0 153 Exeunt. Manet Brut. & Cass.
0 154 
0 155   Cassi. Will you go see the order of the course?
0 156   Brut. Not I
0 157 
0 158    Cassi. I pray you do
0 159 
0 160    Brut. I am not Gamesom: I do lacke some part
0 161 Of that quicke Spirit that is in Antony:
0 162 Let me not hinder Cassius your desires;
0 163 Ile leaue you
0 164 
0 165    Cassi. Brutus, I do obserue you now of late:
0 166 I haue not from your eyes, that gentlenesse
0 167 And shew of Loue, as I was wont to haue:
0 168 You beare too stubborne, and too strange a hand
0 169 Ouer your Friend, that loues you
0 170 
0 171    Bru. Cassius,
0 172 Be not deceiu'd: If I haue veyl'd my looke,
0 173 I turne the trouble of my Countenance
0 174 Meerely vpon my selfe. Vexed I am
0 175 Of late, with passions of some difference,
0 176 Conceptions onely proper to my selfe,
0 177 Which giue some soyle (perhaps) to my Behauiours:
0 178 But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu'd
0 179 (Among which number Cassius be you one)
0 180 Nor construe any further my neglect,
0 181 Then that poore Brutus with himselfe at warre,
0 182 Forgets the shewes of Loue to other men
0 183 
0 184    Cassi. Then Brutus, I haue much mistook your passion,
0 185 By meanes whereof, this Brest of mine hath buried
0 186 Thoughts of great value, worthy Cogitations.
0 187 Tell me good Brutus, Can you see your face?
0 188   Brutus. No Cassius:
0 189 For the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection,
0 190 By some other things
0 191 
0 192    Cassius. 'Tis iust,
0 193 And it is very much lamented Brutus,
0 194 That you haue no such Mirrors, as will turne
0 195 Your hidden worthinesse into your eye,
0 196 That you might see your shadow:
0 197 I haue heard,
0 198 Where many of the best respect in Rome,
0 199 (Except immortall Caesar) speaking of Brutus,
0 200 And groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake,
0 201 Haue wish'd, that Noble Brutus had his eyes
0 202 
0 203    Bru. Into what dangers, would you
0 204 Leade me Cassius?
0 205 That you would haue me seeke into my selfe,
0 206 For that which is not in me?
0 207   Cas. Therefore good Brutus, be prepar'd to heare:
0 208 And since you know, you cannot see your selfe
0 209 So well as by Reflection; I your Glasse,
0 210 Will modestly discouer to your selfe
0 211 That of your selfe, which you yet know not of.
0 212 And be not iealous on me, gentle Brutus:
0 213 Were I a common Laughter, or did vse
0 214 To stale with ordinary Oathes my loue
0 215 To euery new Protester: if you know,
0 216 That I do fawne on men, and hugge them hard,
0 217 And after scandall them: Or if you know,
0 218 That I professe my selfe in Banquetting
0 219 To all the Rout, then hold me dangerous.
0 220 
0 221 Flourish, and Shout.
0 222 
0 223   Bru. What meanes this Showting?
0 224 I do feare, the People choose Caesar
0 225 For their King
0 226 
0 227    Cassi. I, do you feare it?
0 228 Then must I thinke you would not haue it so
0 229 
0 230    Bru. I would not Cassius, yet I loue him well:
0 231 But wherefore do you hold me heere so long?
0 232 What is it, that you would impart to me?
0 233 If it be ought toward the generall good,
0 234 Set Honor in one eye, and Death i'th other,
0 235 And I will looke on both indifferently:
0 236 For let the Gods so speed mee, as I loue
0 237 The name of Honor, more then I feare death
0 238 
0 239    Cassi. I know that vertue to be in you Brutus,
0 240 As well as I do know your outward fauour.
0 241 Well, Honor is the subiect of my Story:
0 242 I cannot tell, what you and other men
0 243 Thinke of this life: But for my single selfe,
0 244 I had as liefe not be, as liue to be
0 245 In awe of such a Thing, as I my selfe.
0 246 I was borne free as Caesar, so were you,
0 247 We both haue fed as well, and we can both
0 248 Endure the Winters cold, as well as hee.
0 249 For once, vpon a Rawe and Gustie day,
0 250 The troubled Tyber, chafing with her Shores,
0 251 Caesar saide to me, Dar'st thou Cassius now
0 252 Leape in with me into this angry Flood,
0 253 And swim to yonder Point? Vpon the word,
0 254 Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,
0 255 And bad him follow: so indeed he did.
0 256 The Torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
0 257 With lusty Sinewes, throwing it aside,
0 258 And stemming it with hearts of Controuersie.
0 259 But ere we could arriue the Point propos'd,
0 260 Caesar cride, Helpe me Cassius, or I sinke.
0 261 I (as Aeneas, our great Ancestor,
0 262 Did from the Flames of Troy, vpon his shoulder
0 263 The old Anchyses beare) so, from the waues of Tyber
0 264 Did I the tyred Caesar: And this Man,
0 265 Is now become a God, and Cassius is
0 266 A wretched Creature, and must bend his body,
0 267 If Caesar carelesly but nod on him.
0 268 He had a Feauer when he was in Spaine,
0 269 And when the Fit was on him, I did marke
0 270 How he did shake: Tis true, this God did shake,
0 271 His Coward lippes did from their colour flye,
0 272 And that same Eye, whose bend doth awe the World,
0 273 Did loose his Lustre: I did heare him grone:
0 274 I, and that Tongue of his, that bad the Romans
0 275 Marke him, and write his Speeches in their Bookes,
0 276 Alas, it cried, Giue me some drinke Titinius,
0 277 As a sicke Girle: Ye Gods, it doth amaze me,
0 278 A man of such a feeble temper should
0 279 So get the start of the Maiesticke world,
0 280 And beare the Palme alone.
0 281 
0 282 Shout. Flourish.
0 283 
0 284   Bru. Another generall shout?
0 285 I do beleeue, that these applauses are
0 286 For some new Honors, that are heap'd on Caesar
0 287 
0 288    Cassi. Why man, he doth bestride the narrow world
0 289 Like a Colossus, and we petty men
0 290 Walke vnder his huge legges, and peepe about
0 291 To finde our selues dishonourable Graues.
0 292 Men at sometime, are Masters of their Fates.
0 293 The fault (deere Brutus) is not in our Starres,
0 294 But in our Selues, that we are vnderlings.
0 295 Brutus and Caesar: What should be in that Caesar?
0 296 Why should that name be sounded more then yours
0 297 Write them together: Yours, is as faire a Name:
0 298 Sound them, it doth become the mouth aswell:
0 299 Weigh them, it is as heauy: Coniure with 'em,
0 300 Brutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar.
0 301 Now in the names of all the Gods at once,
0 302 Vpon what meate doth this our Caesar feede,
0 303 That he is growne so great? Age, thou art sham'd.
0 304 Rome, thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods.
0 305 When went there by an Age, since the great Flood,
0 306 But it was fam'd with more then with one man?
0 307 When could they say (till now) that talk'd of Rome,
0 308 That her wide Walkes incompast but one man?
0 309 Now is it Rome indeed, and Roome enough
0 310 When there is in it but one onely man.
0 311 O! you and I, haue heard our Fathers say,
0 312 There was a Brutus once, that would haue brook'd
0 313 Th' eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome,
0 314 As easily as a King
0 315 
0 316    Bru. That you do loue me, I am nothing iealous:
0 317 What you would worke me too, I haue some ayme:
0 318 How I haue thought of this, and of these times
0 319 I shall recount heereafter. For this present,
0 320 I would not so (with loue I might intreat you)
0 321 Be any further moou'd: What you haue said,
0 322 I will consider: what you haue to say
0 323 I will with patience heare, and finde a time
0 324 Both meete to heare, and answer such high things.
0 325 Till then, my Noble Friend, chew vpon this:
0 326 Brutus had rather be a Villager,
0 327 Then to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome
0 328 Vnder these hard Conditions, as this time
0 329 Is like to lay vpon vs
0 330 
0 331    Cassi. I am glad that my weake words
0 332 Haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from Brutus,
0 333 Enter Caesar and his Traine.
0 334 
0 335   Bru. The Games are done,
0 336 And Caesar is returning
0 337 
0 338    Cassi. As they passe by,
0 339 Plucke Caska by the Sleeue,
0 340 And he will (after his sowre fashion) tell you
0 341 What hath proceeded worthy note to day
0 342 
0 343    Bru. I will do so: but looke you Cassius,
0 344 The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow,
0 345 And all the rest, looke like a chidden Traine;
0 346 Calphurnia's Cheeke is pale, and Cicero
0 347 Lookes with such Ferret, and such fiery eyes
0 348 As we haue seene him in the Capitoll
0 349 Being crost in Conference, by some Senators
0 350 
0 351    Cassi. Caska will tell vs what the matter is
0 352 
0 353    Caes Antonio
0 354 
0 355    Ant. Caesar
0 356 
0 357    Caes Let me haue men about me, that are fat,
0 358 Sleeke-headed men, and such as sleepe a-nights:
0 359 Yond Cassius has a leane and hungry looke,
0 360 He thinkes too much: such men are dangerous
0 361 
0 362    Ant. Feare him not Caesar, he's not dangerous,
0 363 He is a Noble Roman, and well giuen
0 364 
0 365    Caes Would he were fatter; But I feare him not:
0 366 Yet if my name were lyable to feare,
0 367 I do not know the man I should auoyd
0 368 So soone as that spare Cassius. He reades much,
0 369 He is a great Obseruer, and he lookes
0 370 Quite through the Deeds of men. He loues no Playes,
0 371 As thou dost Antony: he heares no Musicke;
0 372 Seldome he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
0 373 As if he mock'd himselfe, and scorn'd his spirit
0 374 That could be mou'd to smile at any thing.
0 375 Such men as he, be neuer at hearts ease,
0 376 Whiles they behold a greater then themselues,
0 377 And therefore are they very dangerous.
0 378 I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd,
0 379 Then what I feare: for alwayes I am Caesar.
0 380 Come on my right hand, for this eare is deafe,
0 381 And tell me truely, what thou think'st of him.
0 382 
0 383 Sennit.
0 384 
0 385 Exeunt. Caesar and his Traine.
0 386 
0 387   Cask. You pul'd me by the cloake, would you speake
0 388 with me?
0 389   Bru. I Caska, tell vs what hath chanc'd to day
0 390 That Caesar lookes so sad
0 391 
0 392    Cask. Why you were with him, were you not?
0 393   Bru. I should not then aske Caska what had chanc'd
0 394 
0 395    Cask. Why there was a Crowne offer'd him; & being
0 396 offer'd him, he put it by with the backe of his hand thus,
0 397 and then the people fell a shouting
0 398 
0 399    Bru. What was the second noyse for?
0 400   Cask. Why for that too
0 401 
0 402    Cassi. They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
0 403   Cask. Why for that too
0 404 
0 405    Bru. Was the Crowne offer'd him thrice?
0 406   Cask. I marry was't, and hee put it by thrice, euerie
0 407 time gentler then other; and at euery putting by, mine
0 408 honest Neighbors showted
0 409 
0 410    Cassi. Who offer'd him the Crowne?
0 411   Cask. Why Antony
0 412 
0 413    Bru. Tell vs the manner of it, gentle Caska
0 414 
0 415    Caska. I can as well bee hang'd as tell the manner of
0 416 it: It was meere Foolerie, I did not marke it. I sawe
0 417 Marke Antony offer him a Crowne, yet 'twas not a
0 418 Crowne neyther, 'twas one of these Coronets: and as I
0 419 told you, hee put it by once: but for all that, to my thinking,
0 420 he would faine haue had it. Then hee offered it to
0 421 him againe: then hee put it by againe: but to my thinking,
0 422 he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then
0 423 he offered it the third time; hee put it the third time by,
0 424 and still as hee refus'd it, the rabblement howted, and
0 425 clapp'd their chopt hands, and threw vppe their sweatie
0 426 Night-cappes, and vttered such a deale of stinking
0 427 breath, because Caesar refus'd the Crowne, that it had
0 428 (almost) choaked Caesar: for hee swoonded, and fell
0 429 downe at it: And for mine owne part, I durst not laugh,
0 430 for feare of opening my Lippes, and receyuing the bad
0 431 Ayre
0 432 
0 433    Cassi. But soft I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
0 434   Cask. He fell downe in the Market-place, and foam'd
0 435 at mouth, and was speechlesse
0 436 
0 437    Brut. 'Tis very like he hath the Falling sicknesse
0 438 
0 439    Cassi. No, Caesar hath it not: but you, and I,
0 440 And honest Caska, we haue the Falling sicknesse
0 441 
0 442    Cask. I know not what you meane by that, but I am
0 443 sure Caesar fell downe. If the tag-ragge people did not
0 444 clap him, and hisse him, according as he pleas'd, and displeas'd
0 445 them, as they vse to doe the Players in the Theatre,
0 446 I am no true man
0 447 
0 448    Brut. What said he, when he came vnto himselfe?
0 449   Cask. Marry, before he fell downe, when he perceiu'd
0 450 the common Heard was glad he refus'd the Crowne, he
0 451 pluckt me ope his Doublet, and offer'd them his Throat
0 452 to cut: and I had beene a man of any Occupation, if I
0 453 would not haue taken him at a word, I would I might
0 454 goe to Hell among the Rogues, and so hee fell. When
0 455 he came to himselfe againe, hee said, If hee had done, or
0 456 said any thing amisse, he desir'd their Worships to thinke
0 457 it was his infirmitie. Three or foure Wenches where I
0 458 stood, cryed, Alasse good Soule, and forgaue him with
0 459 all their hearts: But there's no heed to be taken of them;
0 460 if Caesar had stab'd their Mothers, they would haue done
0 461 no lesse
0 462 
0 463    Brut. And after that, he came thus sad away
0 464 
0 465    Cask. I
0 466 
0 467    Cassi. Did Cicero say any thing?
0 468   Cask. I, he spoke Greeke
0 469 
0 470    Cassi. To what effect?
0 471   Cask. Nay, and I tell you that, Ile ne're looke you
0 472 i'th' face againe. But those that vnderstood him, smil'd
0 473 at one another, and shooke their heads: but for mine
0 474 owne part, it was Greeke to me. I could tell you more
0 475 newes too: Murrellus and Flauius, for pulling Scarffes
0 476 off Caesars Images, are put to silence. Fare you well.
0 477 There was more Foolerie yet, if I could remember
0 478 it
0 479 
0 480    Cassi. Will you suppe with me to Night, Caska?
0 481   Cask. No, I am promis'd forth
0 482 
0 483    Cassi. Will you Dine with me to morrow?
0 484   Cask. I, if I be aliue, and your minde hold, and your
0 485 Dinner worth the eating
0 486 
0 487    Cassi. Good, I will expect you
0 488 
0 489    Cask. Doe so: farewell both.
0 490 Enter.
0 491 
0 492   Brut. What a blunt fellow is this growne to be?
0 493 He was quick Mettle, when he went to Schoole
0 494 
0 495    Cassi. So is he now, in execution
0 496 Of any bold, or Noble Enterprize,
0 497 How-euer he puts on this tardie forme:
0 498 This Rudenesse is a Sawce to his good Wit,
0 499 Which giues men stomacke to disgest his words
0 500 With better Appetite
0 501 
0 502    Brut. And so it is:
0 503 For this time I will leaue you:
0 504 To morrow, if you please to speake with me,
0 505 I will come home to you: or if you will,
0 506 Come home to me, and I will wait for you
0 507 
0 508    Cassi. I will doe so: till then, thinke of the World.
0 509 Exit Brutus.
0 510 
0 511 Well Brutus, thou art Noble: yet I see,
0 512 Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought
0 513 From that it is dispos'd: therefore it is meet,
0 514 That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes:
0 515 For who so firme, that cannot be seduc'd?
0 516 Caesar doth beare me hard, but he loues Brutus.
0 517 If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,
0 518 He should not humor me. I will this Night,
0 519 In seuerall Hands, in at his Windowes throw,
0 520 As if they came from seuerall Citizens,
0 521 Writings, all tending to the great opinion
0 522 That Rome holds of his Name: wherein obscurely
0 523 Caesars Ambition shall be glanced at.
0 524 And after this, let Caesar seat him sure,
0 525 For wee will shake him, or worse dayes endure.
0 526 Enter.
0 527 
0 528 Thunder, and Lightning. Enter Caska, and Cicero.
0 529 
0 530   Cic. Good euen, Caska: brought you Caesar home?
0 531 Why are you breathlesse, and why stare you so?
0 532   Cask. Are not you mou'd, when all the sway of Earth
0 533 Shakes, like a thing vnfirme? O Cicero,
0 534 I haue seene Tempests, when the scolding Winds
0 535 Haue riu'd the knottie Oakes, and I haue seene
0 536 Th' ambitious Ocean swell, and rage, and foame,
0 537 To be exalted with the threatning Clouds:
0 538 But neuer till to Night, neuer till now,
0 539 Did I goe through a Tempest-dropping-fire.
0 540 Eyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen,
0 541 Or else the World, too sawcie with the Gods,
0 542 Incenses them to send destruction
0 543 
0 544    Cic. Why, saw you any thing more wonderfull?
0 545   Cask. A common slaue, you know him well by sight,
0 546 Held vp his left Hand, which did flame and burne
0 547 Like twentie Torches ioyn'd; and yet his Hand,
0 548 Not sensible of fire, remain'd vnscorch'd.
0 549 Besides, I ha' not since put vp my Sword,
0 550 Against the Capitoll I met a Lyon,
0 551 Who glaz'd vpon me, and went surly by,
0 552 Without annoying me. And there were drawne
0 553 Vpon a heape, a hundred gastly Women,
0 554 Transformed with their feare, who swore, they saw
0 555 Men, all in fire, walke vp and downe the streetes.
0 556 And yesterday, the Bird of Night did sit,
0 557 Euen at Noone-day, vpon the Market place,
0 558 Howting, and shreeking. When these Prodigies
0 559 Doe so conioyntly meet, let not men say,
0 560 These are their Reasons, they are Naturall:
0 561 For I beleeue, they are portentous things
0 562 Vnto the Clymate, that they point vpon
0 563 
0 564    Cic. Indeed, it is a strange disposed time:
0 565 But men may construe things after their fashion,
0 566 Cleane from the purpose of the things themselues.
0 567 Comes Caesar to the Capitoll to morrow?
0 568   Cask. He doth: for he did bid Antonio
0 569 Send word to you, he would be there to morrow
0 570 
0 571    Cic. Good-night then, Caska:
0 572 This disturbed Skie is not to walke in
0 573 
0 574    Cask. Farewell Cicero.
0 575 
0 576 Exit Cicero.
0 577 
0 578 Enter Cassius.
0 579 
0 580   Cassi. Who's there?
0 581   Cask. A Romane
0 582 
0 583    Cassi. Caska, by your Voyce
0 584 
0 585    Cask. Your Eare is good.
0 586 Cassius, what Night is this?
0 587   Cassi. A very pleasing Night to honest men
0 588 
0 589    Cask. Who euer knew the Heauens menace so?
0 590   Cassi. Those that haue knowne the Earth so full of
0 591 faults.
0 592 For my part, I haue walk'd about the streets,
0 593 Submitting me vnto the perillous Night;
0 594 And thus vnbraced, Caska, as you see,
0 595 Haue bar'd my Bosome to the Thunder-stone:
0 596 And when the crosse blew Lightning seem'd to open
0 597 The Brest of Heauen, I did present my selfe
0 598 Euen in the ayme, and very flash of it
0 599 
0 600    Cask. But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heauens?
0 601 It is the part of men, to feare and tremble,
0 602 When the most mightie Gods, by tokens send
0 603 Such dreadfull Heraulds, to astonish vs
0 604 
0 605    Cassi. You are dull, Caska:
0 606 And those sparkes of Life, that should be in a Roman,
0 607 You doe want, or else you vse not.
0 608 You looke pale, and gaze, and put on feare,
0 609 And cast your selfe in wonder,
0 610 To see the strange impatience of the Heauens:
0 611 But if you would consider the true cause,
0 612 Why all these Fires, why all these gliding Ghosts,
0 613 Why Birds and Beasts, from qualitie and kinde,
0 614 Why Old men, Fooles, and Children calculate,
0 615 Why all these things change from their Ordinance,
0 616 Their Natures, and pre-formed Faculties,
0 617 To monstrous qualitie; why you shall finde,
0 618 That Heauen hath infus'd them with these Spirits,
0 619 To make them Instruments of feare, and warning,
0 620 Vnto some monstrous State.
0 621 Now could I (Caska) name to thee a man,
0 622 Most like this dreadfull Night,
0 623 That Thunders, Lightens, opens Graues, and roares,
0 624 As doth the Lyon in the Capitoll:
0 625 A man no mightier then thy selfe, or me,
0 626 In personall action; yet prodigious growne,
0 627 And fearefull, as these strange eruptions are
0 628 
0 629    Cask. 'Tis Caesar that you meane:
0 630 Is it not, Cassius?
0 631   Cassi. Let it be who it is: for Romans now
0 632 Haue Thewes, and Limbes, like to their Ancestors;
0 633 But woe the while, our Fathers mindes are dead,
0 634 And we are gouern'd with our Mothers spirits,
0 635 Our yoake, and sufferance, shew vs Womanish
0 636 
0 637    Cask. Indeed, they say, the Senators to morrow
0 638 Meane to establish Caesar as a King:
0 639 And he shall weare his Crowne by Sea, and Land,
0 640 In euery place, saue here in Italy
0 641 
0 642    Cassi. I know where I will weare this Dagger then;
0 643 Cassius from Bondage will deliuer Cassius:
0 644 Therein, yee Gods, you make the weake most strong;
0 645 Therein, yee Gods, you Tyrants doe defeat.
0 646 Nor Stonie Tower, nor Walls of beaten Brasse,
0 647 Nor ayre-lesse Dungeon, nor strong Linkes of Iron,
0 648 Can be retentiue to the strength of spirit:
0 649 But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres,
0 650 Neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe.
0 651 If I know this, know all the World besides,
0 652 That part of Tyrannie that I doe beare,
0 653 I can shake off at pleasure.
0 654 
0 655 Thunder still.
0 656 
0 657   Cask. So can I:
0 658 So euery Bond-man in his owne hand beares
0 659 The power to cancell his Captiuitie
0 660 
0 661    Cassi. And why should Cæsar be a Tyrant then?
0 662 Poore man, I know he would not be a Wolfe,
0 663 But that he sees the Romans are but Sheepe:
0 664 He were no Lyon, were not Romans Hindes.
0 665 Those that with haste will make a mightie fire,
0 666 Begin it with weake Strawes. What trash is Rome?
0 667 What Rubbish, and what Offall? when it serues
0 668 For the base matter, to illuminate
0 669 So vile a thing as Caesar. But oh Griefe,
0 670 Where hast thou led me? I (perhaps) speake this
0 671 Before a willing Bond-man: then I know
0 672 My answere must be made. But I am arm'd,
0 673 And dangers are to me indifferent
0 674 
0 675    Cask. You speake to Caska, and to such a man,
0 676 That is no flearing Tell-tale. Hold, my Hand:
0 677 Be factious for redresse of all these Griefes,
0 678 And I will set this foot of mine as farre,
0 679 As who goes farthest
0 680 
0 681    Cassi. There's a Bargaine made.
0 682 Now know you, Caska, I haue mou'd already
0 683 Some certaine of the Noblest minded Romans
0 684 To vnder-goe, with me, an Enterprize,
0 685 Of Honorable dangerous consequence;
0 686 And I doe know by this, they stay for me
0 687 In Pompeyes Porch: for now this fearefull Night,
0 688 There is no stirre, or walking in the streetes;
0 689 And the Complexion of the Element
0 690 Is Fauors, like the Worke we haue in hand,
0 691 Most bloodie, fierie, and most terrible.
0 692 Enter Cinna.
0 693 
0 694   Caska. Stand close a while, for heere comes one in
0 695 haste
0 696 
0 697    Cassi. 'Tis Cinna, I doe know him by his Gate,
0 698 He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?
0 699   Cinna. To finde out you: Who's that, Metellus
0 700 Cymber?
0 701   Cassi. No, it is Caska, one incorporate
0 702 To our Attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
0 703   Cinna. I am glad on't.
0 704 What a fearefull Night is this?
0 705 There's two or three of vs haue seene strange sights
0 706 
0 707    Cassi. Am I not stay'd for? tell me
0 708 
0 709    Cinna. Yes, you are. O Cassius,
0 710 If you could but winne the Noble Brutus
0 711 To our party-
0 712   Cassi. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this Paper,
0 713 And looke you lay it in the Pretors Chayre,
0 714 Where Brutus may but finde it: and throw this
0 715 In at his Window; set this vp with Waxe
0 716 Vpon old Brutus Statue: all this done,
0 717 Repaire to Pompeyes Porch, where you shall finde vs.
0 718 Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
0 719   Cinna. All, but Metellus Cymber, and hee's gone
0 720 To seeke you at your house. Well, I will hie,
0 721 And so bestow these Papers as you bad me
0 722 
0 723    Cassi. That done, repayre to Pompeyes Theater.
0 724 
0 725 Exit Cinna.
0 726 
0 727 Come Caska, you and I will yet, ere day,
0 728 See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
0 729 Is ours alreadie, and the man entire
0 730 Vpon the next encounter, yeelds him ours
0 731 
0 732    Cask. O, he sits high in all the Peoples hearts:
0 733 And that which would appeare Offence in vs,
0 734 His Countenance, like richest Alchymie,
0 735 Will change to Vertue, and to Worthinesse
0 736 
0 737    Cassi. Him, and his worth, and our great need of him,
0 738 You haue right well conceited: let vs goe,
0 739 For it is after Mid-night, and ere day,
0 740 We will awake him, and be sure of him.
0 741 
0 742 Exeunt.
0 743 
0 744 
0 745 Actus Secundus.
0 746 
0 747 Enter Brutus in his Orchard.
0 748 
0 749   Brut. What Lucius, hoe?
0 750 I cannot, by the progresse of the Starres,
0 751 Giue guesse how neere to day- Lucius, I say?
0 752 I would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly.
0 753 When Lucius, when? awake, I say: what Lucius?
0 754 Enter Lucius.
0 755 
0 756   Luc. Call'd you, my Lord?
0 757   Brut. Get me a Tapor in my Study, Lucius:
0 758 When it is lighted, come and call me here
0 759 
0 760    Luc. I will, my Lord.
0 761 Enter.
0 762 
0 763   Brut. It must be by his death: and for my part,
0 764 I know no personall cause, to spurne at him,
0 765 But for the generall. He would be crown'd:
0 766 How that might change his nature, there's the question?
0 767 It is the bright day, that brings forth the Adder,
0 768 And that craues warie walking: Crowne him that,
0 769 And then I graunt we put a Sting in him,
0 770 That at his will he may doe danger with.
0 771 Th' abuse of Greatnesse, is, when it dis-ioynes
0 772 Remorse from Power: And to speake truth of Caesar,
0 773 I haue not knowne, when his Affections sway'd
0 774 More then his Reason. But 'tis a common proofe,
0 775 That Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder,
0 776 Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face:
0 777 But when he once attaines the vpmost Round,
0 778 He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe,
0 779 Lookes in the Clouds, scorning the base degrees
0 780 By which he did ascend: so Caesar may;
0 781 Then least he may, preuent. And since the Quarrell
0 782 Will beare no colour, for the thing he is,
0 783 Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
0 784 Would runne to these, and these extremities:
0 785 And therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge,
0 786 Which hatch'd, would as his kinde grow mischieuous;
0 787 And kill him in the shell.
0 788 Enter Lucius.
0 789 
0 790   Luc. The Taper burneth in your Closet, Sir:
0 791 Searching the Window for a Flint, I found
0 792 This Paper, thus seal'd vp, and I am sure
0 793 It did not lye there when I went to Bed.
0 794 
0 795 Giues him the Letter.
0 796 
0 797   Brut. Get you to Bed againe, it is not day:
0 798 Is not to morrow (Boy) the first of March?
0 799   Luc. I know not, Sir
0 800 
0 801    Brut. Looke in the Calender, and bring me word
0 802 
0 803    Luc. I will, Sir.
0 804 Enter.
0 805 
0 806   Brut. The exhalations, whizzing in the ayre,
0 807 Giue so much light, that I may reade by them.
0 808 
0 809 Opens the Letter, and reades.
0 810 
0 811 Brutus thou sleep'st; awake, and see thy selfe:
0 812 Shall Rome, &c. speake, strike, redresse.
0 813 Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake.
0 814 Such instigations haue beene often dropt,
0 815 Where I haue tooke them vp:
0 816 Shall Rome, &c. Thus must I piece it out:
0 817 Shall Rome stand vnder one mans awe? What Rome?
0 818 My Ancestors did from the streetes of Rome
0 819 The Tarquin driue, when he was call'd a King.
0 820 Speake, strike, redresse. Am I entreated
0 821 To speake, and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
0 822 If the redresse will follow, thou receiuest
0 823 Thy full Petition at the hand of Brutus.
0 824 Enter Lucius.
0 825 
0 826   Luc. Sir, March is wasted fifteene dayes.
0 827 
0 828 Knocke within.
0 829 
0 830   Brut. 'Tis good. Go to the Gate, some body knocks:
0 831 Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
0 832 I haue not slept.
0 833 Betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing,
0 834 And the first motion, all the Interim is
0 835 Like a Phantasma, or a hideous Dreame:
0 836 The Genius, and the mortall Instruments
0 837 Are then in councell; and the state of a man,
0 838 Like to a little Kingdome, suffers then
0 839 The nature of an Insurrection.
0 840 Enter Lucius.
0 841 
0 842   Luc. Sir, 'tis your Brother Cassius at the Doore,
0 843 Who doth desire to see you
0 844 
0 845    Brut. Is he alone?
0 846   Luc. No, Sir, there are moe with him
0 847 
0 848    Brut. Doe you know them?
0 849   Luc. No, Sir, their Hats are pluckt about their Eares,
0 850 And halfe their Faces buried in their Cloakes,
0 851 That by no meanes I may discouer them,
0 852 By any marke of fauour
0 853 
0 854    Brut. Let 'em enter:
0 855 They are the Faction. O Conspiracie,
0 856 Sham'st thou to shew thy dang'rous Brow by Night,
0 857 When euills are most free? O then, by day
0 858 Where wilt thou finde a Cauerne darke enough,
0 859 To maske thy monstrous Visage? Seek none Conspiracie,
0 860 Hide it in Smiles, and Affabilitie:
0 861 For if thou path thy natiue semblance on,
0 862 Not Erebus it selfe were dimme enough,
0 863 To hide thee from preuention.
0 864 Enter the Conspirators, Cassius, Caska, Decius, Cinna, Metellus,
0 865 and
0 866 Trebonius.
0 867 
0 868   Cass. I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest:
0 869 Good morrow Brutus, doe we trouble you?
0 870   Brut. I haue beene vp this howre, awake all Night:
0 871 Know I these men, that come along with you?
0 872   Cass. Yes, euery man of them; and no man here
0 873 But honors you: and euery one doth wish,
0 874 You had but that opinion of your selfe,
0 875 Which euery Noble Roman beares of you.
0 876 This is Trebonius
0 877 
0 878    Brut. He is welcome hither
0 879 
0 880    Cass. This, Decius Brutus
0 881 
0 882    Brut. He is welcome too
0 883 
0 884    Cass. This, Caska; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus
0 885 Cymber
0 886 
0 887    Brut. They are all welcome.
0 888 What watchfull Cares doe interpose themselues
0 889 Betwixt your Eyes, and Night?
0 890   Cass. Shall I entreat a word?
0 891 
0 892 They whisper.
0 893 
0 894   Decius. Here lyes the East: doth not the Day breake
0 895 heere?
0 896   Cask. No
0 897 
0 898    Cin. O pardon, Sir, it doth; and yon grey Lines,
0 899 That fret the Clouds, are Messengers of Day
0 900 
0 901    Cask. You shall confesse, that you are both deceiu'd:
0 902 Heere, as I point my Sword, the Sunne arises,
0 903 Which is a great way growing on the South,
0 904 Weighing the youthfull Season of the yeare.
0 905 Some two moneths hence, vp higher toward the North
0 906 He first presents his fire, and the high East
0 907 Stands as the Capitoll, directly heere
0 908 
0 909    Bru. Giue me your hands all ouer, one by one
0 910 
0 911    Cas. And let vs sweare our Resolution
0 912 
0 913    Brut. No, not an Oath: if not the Face of men,
0 914 The sufferance of our Soules, the times Abuse;
0 915 If these be Motiues weake, breake off betimes,
0 916 And euery man hence, to his idle bed:
0 917 So let high-sighted-Tyranny range on,
0 918 Till each man drop by Lottery. But if these
0 919 (As I am sure they do) beare fire enough
0 920 To kindle Cowards, and to steele with valour
0 921 The melting Spirits of women. Then Countrymen,
0 922 What neede we any spurre, but our owne cause
0 923 To pricke vs to redresse? What other Bond,
0 924 Then secret Romans, that haue spoke the word,
0 925 And will not palter? And what other Oath,
0 926 Then Honesty to Honesty ingag'd,
0 927 That this shall be, or we will fall for it.
0 928 Sweare Priests and Cowards, and men Cautelous
0 929 Old feeble Carrions, and such suffering Soules
0 930 That welcome wrongs: Vnto bad causes, sweare
0 931 Such Creatures as men doubt; but do not staine
0 932 The euen vertue of our Enterprize,
0 933 Nor th' insuppressiue Mettle of our Spirits,
0 934 To thinke, that or our Cause, or our Performance
0 935 Did neede an Oath. When euery drop of blood
0 936 That euery Roman beares, and Nobly beares
0 937 Is guilty of a seuerall Bastardie,
0 938 If he do breake the smallest Particle
0 939 Of any promise that hath past from him
0 940 
0 941    Cas. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
0 942 I thinke he will stand very strong with vs
0 943 
0 944    Cask. Let vs not leaue him out
0 945 
0 946    Cyn. No, by no meanes
0 947 
0 948    Metel. O let vs haue him, for his Siluer haires
0 949 Will purchase vs a good opinion:
0 950 And buy mens voyces, to commend our deeds:
0 951 It shall be sayd, his iudgement rul'd our hands,
0 952 Our youths, and wildenesse, shall no whit appeare,
0 953 But all be buried in his Grauity
0 954 
0 955    Bru. O name him not; let vs not breake with him,
0 956 For he will neuer follow any thing
0 957 That other men begin
0 958 
0 959    Cas. Then leaue him out
0 960 
0 961    Cask. Indeed, he is not fit
0 962 
0 963    Decius. Shall no man else be toucht, but onely Caesar?
0 964   Cas. Decius well vrg'd: I thinke it is not meet,
0 965 Marke Antony, so well belou'd of Caesar,
0 966 Should out-liue Caesar, we shall finde of him
0 967 A shrew'd Contriuer. And you know, his meanes
0 968 If he improue them, may well stretch so farre
0 969 As to annoy vs all: which to preuent,
0 970 Let Antony and Caesar fall together
0 971 
0 972    Bru. Our course will seeme too bloody, Caius Cassius,
0 973 To cut the Head off, and then hacke the Limbes:
0 974 Like Wrath in death, and Enuy afterwards:
0 975 For Antony, is but a Limbe of Caesar.
0 976 Let's be Sacrificers, but not Butchers Caius:
0 977 We all stand vp against the spirit of Caesar,
0 978 And in the Spirit of men, there is no blood:
0 979 O that we then could come by Caesars Spirit,
0 980 And not dismember Caesar! But (alas)
0 981 Caesar must bleed for it. And gentle Friends,
0 982 Let's kill him Boldly, but not Wrathfully:
0 983 Let's carue him, as a Dish fit for the Gods,
0 984 Not hew him as a Carkasse fit for Hounds:
0 985 And let our Hearts, as subtle Masters do,
0 986 Stirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage,
0 987 And after seeme to chide 'em. This shall make
0 988 Our purpose Necessary, and not Enuious.
0 989 Which so appearing to the common eyes,
0 990 We shall be call'd Purgers, not Murderers.
0 991 And for Marke Antony, thinke not of him:
0 992 For he can do no more then Caesars Arme,
0 993 When Caesars head is off
0 994 
0 995    Cas. Yet I feare him,
0 996 For in the ingrafted loue he beares to Caesar
0 997 
0 998    Bru. Alas, good Cassius, do not thinke of him:
0 999 If he loue Caesar, all that he can do
0 1000 Is to himselfe; take thought, and dye for Caesar,
0 1001 And that were much he should: for he is giuen
0 1002 To sports, to wildenesse, and much company
0 1003 
0 1004    Treb. There is no feare in him; let him not dye,
0 1005 For he will liue, and laugh at this heereafter.
0 1006 
0 1007 Clocke strikes.
0 1008 
0 1009   Bru. Peace, count the Clocke
0 1010 
0 1011    Cas. The Clocke hath stricken three
0 1012 
0 1013    Treb. 'Tis time to part
0 1014 
0 1015    Cass. But it is doubtfull yet,
0 1016 Whether Caesar will come forth to day, or no:
0 1017 For he is Superstitious growne of late,
0 1018 Quite from the maine Opinion he held once,
0 1019 Of Fantasie, of Dreames, and Ceremonies:
0 1020 It may be, these apparant Prodigies,
0 1021 The vnaccustom'd Terror of this night,
0 1022 And the perswasion of his Augurers,
0 1023 May hold him from the Capitoll to day
0 1024 
0 1025    Decius. Neuer feare that: If he be so resolu'd,
0 1026 I can ore-sway him: For he loues to heare,
0 1027 That Vnicornes may be betray'd with Trees,
0 1028 And Beares with Glasses, Elephants with Holes,
0 1029 Lyons with Toyles, and men with Flatterers.
0 1030 But, when I tell him, he hates Flatterers,
0 1031 He sayes, he does; being then most flattered.
0 1032 Let me worke:
0 1033 For I can giue his humour the true bent;
0 1034 And I will bring him to the Capitoll
0 1035 
0 1036    Cas. Nay, we will all of vs, be there to fetch him
0 1037 
0 1038    Bru. By the eight houre, is that the vttermost?
0 1039   Cin. Be that the vttermost, and faile not then
0 1040 
0 1041    Met. Caius Ligarius doth beare Caesar hard,
0 1042 Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey;
0 1043 I wonder none of you haue thought of him
0 1044 
0 1045    Bru. Now good Metellus go along by him:
0 1046 He loues me well, and I haue giuen him Reasons,
0 1047 Send him but hither, and Ile fashion him
0 1048 
0 1049    Cas. The morning comes vpon's:
0 1050 Wee'l leaue you Brutus,
0 1051 And Friends disperse your selues; but all remember
0 1052 What you haue said, and shew your selues true Romans
0 1053 
0 1054    Bru. Good Gentlemen, looke fresh and merrily,
0 1055 Let not our lookes put on our purposes,
0 1056 But beare it as our Roman Actors do,
0 1057 With vntyr'd Spirits, and formall Constancie,
0 1058 And so good morrow to you euery one.
0 1059 
0 1060 Exeunt.
0 1061 
0 1062 Manet Brutus.
0 1063 
0 1064 Boy: Lucius: Fast asleepe? It is no matter,
0 1065 Enioy the hony-heauy-Dew of Slumber:
0 1066 Thou hast no Figures, nor no Fantasies,
0 1067 Which busie care drawes, in the braines of men;
0 1068 Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
0 1069 Enter Portia.
0 1070 
0 1071   Por. Brutus, my Lord
0 1072 
0 1073    Bru. Portia: What meane you? wherfore rise you now?
0 1074 It is not for your health, thus to commit
0 1075 Your weake condition, to the raw cold morning
0 1076 
0 1077    Por. Nor for yours neither. Y'haue vngently Brutus
0 1078 Stole from my bed: and yesternight at Supper
0 1079 You sodainly arose, and walk'd about,
0 1080 Musing, and sighing, with your armes acrosse
0 1081 And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
0 1082 You star'd vpon me, with vngentle lookes.
0 1083 I vrg'd you further, then you scratch'd your head,
0 1084 And too impatiently stampt with your foote:
0 1085 Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
0 1086 But with an angry wafter of your hand
0 1087 Gaue signe for me to leaue you: So I did,
0 1088 Fearing to strengthen that impatience
0 1089 Which seem'd too much inkindled; and withall,
0 1090 Hoping it was but an effect of Humor,
0 1091 Which sometime hath his houre with euery man.
0 1092 It will not let you eate, nor talke, nor sleepe;
0 1093 And could it worke so much vpon your shape,
0 1094 As it hath much preuayl'd on your Condition,
0 1095 I should not know you Brutus. Deare my Lord,
0 1096 Make me acquainted with your cause of greefe
0 1097 
0 1098    Bru. I am not well in health, and that is all
0 1099 
0 1100    Por. Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,
0 1101 He would embrace the meanes to come by it
0 1102 
0 1103    Bru. Why so I do: good Portia go to bed
0 1104 
0 1105    Por. Is Brutus sicke? And is it Physicall
0 1106 To walke vnbraced, and sucke vp the humours
0 1107 Of the danke Morning? What, is Brutus sicke?
0 1108 And will he steale out of his wholsome bed
0 1109 To dare the vile contagion of the Night?
0 1110 And tempt the Rhewmy, and vnpurged Ayre,
0 1111 To adde vnto his sicknesse? No my Brutus,
0 1112 You haue some sicke Offence within your minde,
0 1113 Which by the Right and Vertue of my place
0 1114 I ought to know of: And vpon my knees,
0 1115 I charme you, by my once commended Beauty,
0 1116 By all your vowes of Loue, and that great Vow
0 1117 Which did incorporate and make vs one,
0 1118 That you vnfold to me, your selfe; your halfe
0 1119 Why you are heauy: and what men to night
0 1120 Haue had resort to you: for heere haue beene
0 1121 Some sixe or seuen, who did hide their faces
0 1122 Euen from darknesse
0 1123 
0 1124    Bru. Kneele not gentle Portia
0 1125 
0 1126    Por. I should not neede, if you were gentle Brutus.
0 1127 Within the Bond of Marriage, tell me Brutus,
0 1128 Is it excepted, I should know no Secrets
0 1129 That appertaine to you? Am I your Selfe,
0 1130 But as it were in sort, or limitation?
0 1131 To keepe with you at Meales, comfort your Bed,
0 1132 And talke to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the Suburbs
0 1133 Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
0 1134 Portia is Brutus Harlot, not his Wife
0 1135 
0 1136    Bru. You are my true and honourable Wife,
0 1137 As deere to me, as are the ruddy droppes
0 1138 That visit my sad heart
0 1139 
0 1140    Por. If this were true, then should I know this secret.
0 1141 I graunt I am a Woman; but withall,
0 1142 A Woman that Lord Brutus tooke to Wife:
0 1143 I graunt I am a Woman; but withall,
0 1144 A Woman well reputed: Cato's Daughter.
0 1145 Thinke you, I am no stronger then my Sex
0 1146 Being so Father'd, and so Husbanded?
0 1147 Tell me your Counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
0 1148 I haue made strong proofe of my Constancie,
0 1149 Giuing my selfe a voluntary wound
0 1150 Heere, in the Thigh: Can I beare that with patience,
0 1151 And not my Husbands Secrets?
0 1152   Bru. O ye Gods!
0 1153 Render me worthy of this Noble Wife.
0 1154 
0 1155 Knocke.
0 1156 
0 1157 Harke, harke, one knockes: Portia go in a while,
0 1158 And by and by thy bosome shall partake
0 1159 The secrets of my Heart.
0 1160 All my engagements, I will construe to thee,
0 1161 All the Charractery of my sad browes:
0 1162 Leaue me with hast.
0 1163 
0 1164 Exit Portia.
0 1165 
0 1166 Enter Lucius and Ligarius.
0 1167 
0 1168 Lucius, who's that knockes
0 1169 
0 1170    Luc. Heere is a sicke man that would speak with you
0 1171 
0 1172    Bru. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
0 1173 Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?
0 1174   Cai. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
0 1175 
0 1176    Bru. O what a time haue you chose out braue Caius
0 1177 To weare a Kerchiefe? Would you were not sicke
0 1178 
0 1179    Cai. I am not sicke, if Brutus haue in hand
0 1180 Any exploit worthy the name of Honor
0 1181 
0 1182    Bru. Such an exploit haue I in hand Ligarius,
0 1183 Had you a healthfull eare to heare of it
0 1184 
0 1185    Cai. By all the Gods that Romans bow before,
0 1186 I heere discard my sicknesse. Soule of Rome,
0 1187 Braue Sonne, deriu'd from Honourable Loines,
0 1188 Thou like an Exorcist, hast coniur'd vp
0 1189 My mortified Spirit. Now bid me runne,
0 1190 And I will striue with things impossible,
0 1191 Yea get the better of them. What's to do?
0 1192   Bru. A peece of worke,
0 1193 That will make sicke men whole
0 1194 
0 1195    Cai. But are not some whole, that we must make sicke?
0 1196   Bru. That must we also. What it is my Caius,
0 1197 I shall vnfold to thee, as we are going,
0 1198 To whom it must be done
0 1199 
0 1200    Cai. Set on your foote,
0 1201 And with a heart new-fir'd, I follow you,
0 1202 To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
0 1203 That Brutus leads me on.
0 1204 
0 1205 Thunder
0 1206 
0 1207   Bru. Follow me then.
0 1208 
0 1209 Exeunt.
0 1210 
0 1211 Thunder & Lightning
0 1212 
0 1213 Enter Iulius Caesar in his Night-gowne.
0 1214 
0 1215   Caesar. Nor Heauen, nor Earth,
0 1216 Haue beene at peace to night:
0 1217 Thrice hath Calphurnia, in her sleepe cryed out,
0 1218 Helpe, ho: They murther Caesar. Who's within?
0 1219 Enter a Seruant.
0 1220 
0 1221   Ser. My Lord
0 1222 
0 1223    Caes Go bid the Priests do present Sacrifice,
0 1224 And bring me their opinions of Successe
0 1225 
0 1226    Ser. I will my Lord.
0 1227 
0 1228 Exit
0 1229 
0 1230 Enter Calphurnia.
0 1231 
0 1232   Cal. What mean you Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
0 1233 You shall not stirre out of your house to day
0 1234 
0 1235    Caes Caesar shall forth; the things that threaten'd me,
0 1236 Ne're look'd but on my backe: When they shall see
0 1237 The face of Caesar, they are vanished
0 1238 
0 1239    Calp. Caesar, I neuer stood on Ceremonies,
0 1240 Yet now they fright me: There is one within,
0 1241 Besides the things that we haue heard and seene,
0 1242 Recounts most horrid sights seene by the Watch.
0 1243 A Lionnesse hath whelped in the streets,
0 1244 And Graues haue yawn'd, and yeelded vp their dead;
0 1245 Fierce fiery Warriours fight vpon the Clouds
0 1246 In Rankes and Squadrons, and right forme of Warre
0 1247 Which drizel'd blood vpon the Capitoll:
0 1248 The noise of Battell hurtled in the Ayre:
0 1249 Horsses do neigh, and dying men did grone,
0 1250 And Ghosts did shrieke and squeale about the streets.
0 1251 O Caesar, these things are beyond all vse,
0 1252 And I do feare them
0 1253 
0 1254    Caes What can be auoyded
0 1255 Whose end is purpos'd by the mighty Gods?
0 1256 Yet Caesar shall go forth: for these Predictions
0 1257 Are to the world in generall, as to Caesar
0 1258 
0 1259    Calp. When Beggers dye, there are no Comets seen,
0 1260 The Heauens themselues blaze forth the death of Princes
0 1261   Caes Cowards dye many times before their deaths,
0 1262 The valiant neuer taste of death but once:
0 1263 Of all the Wonders that I yet haue heard,
0 1264 It seemes to me most strange that men should feare,
0 1265 Seeing that death, a necessary end
0 1266 Will come, when it will come.
0 1267 Enter a Seruant.
0 1268 
0 1269 What say the Augurers?
0 1270   Ser. They would not haue you to stirre forth to day.
0 1271 Plucking the intrailes of an Offering forth,
0 1272 They could not finde a heart within the beast
0 1273 
0 1274    Caes The Gods do this in shame of Cowardice:
0 1275 Caesar should be a Beast without a heart
0 1276 If he should stay at home to day for feare:
0 1277 No Caesar shall not; Danger knowes full well
0 1278 That Caesar is more dangerous then he.
0 1279 We heare two Lyons litter'd in one day,
0 1280 And I the elder and more terrible,
0 1281 And Caesar shall go foorth
0 1282 
0 1283    Calp. Alas my Lord,
0 1284 Your wisedome is consum'd in confidence:
0 1285 Do not go forth to day: Call it my feare,
0 1286 That keepes you in the house, and not your owne.
0 1287 Wee'l send Mark Antony to the Senate house,
0 1288 And he shall say, you are not well to day:
0 1289 Let me vpon my knee, preuaile in this
0 1290 
0 1291    Caes Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
0 1292 And for thy humor, I will stay at home.
0 1293 Enter Decius.
0 1294 
0 1295 Heere's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so
0 1296 
0 1297    Deci. Caesar, all haile: Good morrow worthy Caesar,
0 1298 I come to fetch you to the Senate house
0 1299 
0 1300    Caes And you are come in very happy time,
0 1301 To beare my greeting to the Senators,
0 1302 And tell them that I will not come to day:
0 1303 Cannot, is false: and that I dare not, falser:
0 1304 I will not come to day, tell them so Decius
0 1305 
0 1306    Calp. Say he is sicke
0 1307 
0 1308    Caes Shall Caesar send a Lye?
0 1309 Haue I in Conquest stretcht mine Arme so farre,
0 1310 To be afear'd to tell Gray-beards the truth:
0 1311 Decius, go tell them, Caesar will not come
0 1312 
0 1313    Deci. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
0 1314 Lest I be laught at when I tell them so
0 1315 
0 1316    Caes The cause is in my Will, I will not come,
0 1317 That is enough to satisfie the Senate.
0 1318 But for your priuate satisfaction,
0 1319 Because I loue you, I will let you know.
0 1320 Calphurnia heere my wife, stayes me at home:
0 1321 She dreampt to night, she saw my Statue,
0 1322 Which like a Fountaine, with an hundred spouts
0 1323 Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
0 1324 Came smiling, & did bathe their hands in it:
0 1325 And these does she apply, for warnings and portents,
0 1326 And euils imminent; and on her knee
0 1327 Hath begg'd, that I will stay at home to day
0 1328 
0 1329    Deci. This Dreame is all amisse interpreted,
0 1330 It was a vision, faire and fortunate:
0 1331 Your Statue spouting blood in many pipes,
0 1332 In which so many smiling Romans bath'd,
0 1333 Signifies, that from you great Rome shall sucke
0 1334 Reuiuing blood, and that great men shall presse
0 1335 For Tinctures, Staines, Reliques, and Cognisance.
0 1336 This by Calphurnia's Dreame is signified
0 1337 
0 1338    Caes And this way haue you well expounded it
0 1339 
0 1340    Deci. I haue, when you haue heard what I can say:
0 1341 And know it now, the Senate haue concluded
0 1342 To giue this day, a Crowne to mighty Caesar.
0 1343 If you shall send them word you will not come,
0 1344 Their mindes may change. Besides, it were a mocke
0 1345 Apt to be render'd, for some one to say,
0 1346 Breake vp the Senate, till another time:
0 1347 When Caesars wife shall meete with better Dreames.
0 1348 If Caesar hide himselfe, shall they not whisper
0 1349 Loe Caesar is affraid?
0 1350 Pardon me Caesar, for my deere deere loue
0 1351 To your proceeding, bids me tell you this:
0 1352 And reason to my loue is liable
0 1353 
0 1354    Caes How foolish do your fears seeme now Calphurnia?
0 1355 I am ashamed I did yeeld to them.
0 1356 Giue me my Robe, for I will go.
0 1357 Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Caska, Trebonius, Cynna, and
0 1358 Publius.
0 1359 
0 1360 And looke where Publius is come to fetch me
0 1361 
0 1362    Pub. Good morrow Caesar
0 1363 
0 1364    Caes Welcome Publius.
0 1365 What Brutus, are you stirr'd so earely too?
0 1366 Good morrow Caska: Caius Ligarius,
0 1367 Caesar was ne're so much your enemy,
0 1368 As that same Ague which hath made you leane.
0 1369 What is't a Clocke?
0 1370   Bru. Caesar, 'tis strucken eight
0 1371 
0 1372    Caes I thanke you for your paines and curtesie.
0 1373 Enter Antony.
0 1374 
0 1375 See, Antony that Reuels long a-nights
0 1376 Is notwithstanding vp. Good morrow Antony
0 1377 
0 1378    Ant. So to most Noble Caesar
0 1379 
0 1380    Caes Bid them prepare within:
0 1381 I am too blame to be thus waited for.
0 1382 Now Cynna, now Metellus: what Trebonius,
0 1383 I haue an houres talke in store for you:
0 1384 Remember that you call on me to day:
0 1385 Be neere me, that I may remember you
0 1386 
0 1387    Treb. Caesar I will: and so neere will I be,
0 1388 That your best Friends shall wish I had beene further
0 1389 
0 1390    Caes Good Friends go in, and taste some wine with me.
0 1391 And we (like Friends) will straight way go together
0 1392 
0 1393    Bru. That euery like is not the same, O Caesar,
0 1394 The heart of Brutus earnes to thinke vpon.
0 1395 
0 1396 Exeunt.
0 1397 
0 1398 Enter Artemidorus.
0 1399 
0 1400 Caesar, beware of Brutus, take heede of Cassius; come not
0 1401 neere Caska, haue an eye to Cynna, trust not Trebonius, marke
0 1402 well Metellus Cymber, Decius Brutus loues thee not: Thou
0 1403 hast wrong'd Caius Ligarius. There is but one minde in all
0 1404 these men, and it is bent against Caesar: If thou beest not
0 1405 Immortall,
0 1406 looke about you: Security giues way to Conspiracie.
0 1407 The mighty Gods defend thee.
0 1408 Thy Louer, Artemidorus.
0 1409 Heere will I stand, till Caesar passe along,
0 1410 And as a Sutor will I giue him this:
0 1411 My heart laments, that Vertue cannot liue
0 1412 Out of the teeth of Emulation.
0 1413 If thou reade this, O Caesar, thou mayest liue;
0 1414 If not, the Fates with Traitors do contriue.
0 1415 Enter.
0 1416 
0 1417 Enter Portia and Lucius.
0 1418 
0 1419   Por. I prythee Boy, run to the Senate-house,
0 1420 Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
0 1421 Why doest thou stay?
0 1422   Luc. To know my errand Madam
0 1423 
0 1424    Por. I would haue had thee there and heere agen
0 1425 Ere I can tell thee what thou should'st do there:
0 1426 O Constancie, be strong vpon my side,
0 1427 Set a huge Mountaine 'tweene my Heart and Tongue:
0 1428 I haue a mans minde, but a womans might:
0 1429 How hard it is for women to keepe counsell.
0 1430 Art thou heere yet?
0 1431   Luc. Madam, what should I do?
0 1432 Run to the Capitoll, and nothing else?
0 1433 And so returne to you, and nothing else?
0 1434   Por. Yes, bring me word Boy, if thy Lord look well,
0 1435 For he went sickly forth: and take good note
0 1436 What Caesar doth, what Sutors presse to him.
0 1437 Hearke Boy, what noyse is that?
0 1438   Luc. I heare none Madam
0 1439 
0 1440    Por. Prythee listen well:
0 1441 I heard a bussling Rumor like a Fray,
0 1442 And the winde brings it from the Capitoll
0 1443 
0 1444    Luc. Sooth Madam, I heare nothing.
0 1445 Enter the Soothsayer.
0 1446 
0 1447   Por. Come hither Fellow, which way hast thou bin?
0 1448   Sooth. At mine owne house, good Lady
0 1449 
0 1450    Por. What is't a clocke?
0 1451   Sooth. About the ninth houre Lady
0 1452 
0 1453    Por. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitoll?
0 1454   Sooth. Madam not yet, I go to take my stand,
0 1455 To see him passe on to the Capitoll
0 1456 
0 1457    Por. Thou hast some suite to Caesar, hast thou not?
0 1458   Sooth. That I haue Lady, if it will please Caesar
0 1459 To be so good to Caesar, as to heare me:
0 1460 I shall beseech him to befriend himselfe
0 1461 
0 1462    Por. Why know'st thou any harme's intended towards
0 1463 him?
0 1464   Sooth. None that I know will be,
0 1465 Much that I feare may chance:
0 1466 Good morrow to you: heere the street is narrow:
0 1467 The throng that followes Caesar at the heeles,
0 1468 Of Senators, of Praetors, common Sutors,
0 1469 Will crowd a feeble man (almost) to death:
0 1470 Ile get me to a place more voyd, and there
0 1471 Speake to great Caesar as he comes along.
0 1472 
0 1473 Exit
0 1474 
0 1475   Por. I must go in:
0 1476 Aye me! How weake a thing
0 1477 The heart of woman is? O Brutus,
0 1478 The Heauens speede thee in thine enterprize.
0 1479 Sure the Boy heard me: Brutus hath a suite
0 1480 That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint:
0 1481 Run Lucius, and commend me to my Lord,
0 1482 Say I am merry; Come to me againe,
0 1483 And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
0 1484 
0 1485 Exeunt.
0 1486 
0 1487 Actus Tertius.
0 1488 
0 1489 Flourish
0 1490 
0 1491 Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Caska, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius,
0 1492 Cynna,
0 1493 Antony, Lepidus, Artimedorus, Publius, and the Soothsayer.
0 1494 
0 1495   Caes The Ides of March are come
0 1496 
0 1497    Sooth. I Caesar, but not gone
0 1498 
0 1499    Art. Haile Caesar: Read this Scedule
0 1500 
0 1501    Deci. Trebonius doth desire you to ore-read
0 1502 (At your best leysure) this his humble suite
0 1503 
0 1504    Art. O Caesar, reade mine first: for mine's a suite
0 1505 That touches Caesar neerer. Read it great Caesar
0 1506 
0 1507    Caes What touches vs our selfe, shall be last seru'd
0 1508 
0 1509    Art. Delay not Caesar, read it instantly
0 1510 
0 1511    Caes What, is the fellow mad?
0 1512   Pub. Sirra, giue place
0 1513 
0 1514    Cassi. What, vrge you your Petitions in the street?
0 1515 Come to the Capitoll
0 1516 
0 1517    Popil. I wish your enterprize to day may thriue
0 1518 
0 1519    Cassi. What enterprize Popillius?
0 1520   Popil. Fare you well
0 1521 
0 1522    Bru. What said Popillius Lena?
0 1523   Cassi. He wisht to day our enterprize might thriue:
0 1524 I feare our purpose is discouered
0 1525 
0 1526    Bru. Looke how he makes to Caesar: marke him
0 1527 
0 1528    Cassi. Caska be sodaine, for we feare preuention.
0 1529 Brutus what shall be done? If this be knowne,
0 1530 Cassius or Caesar neuer shall turne backe,
0 1531 For I will slay my selfe
0 1532 
0 1533    Bru. Cassius be constant:
0 1534 Popillius Lena speakes not of our purposes,
0 1535 For looke he smiles, and Caesar doth not change
0 1536 
0 1537    Cassi. Trebonius knowes his time: for look you Brutus
0 1538 He drawes Mark Antony out of the way
0 1539 
0 1540    Deci. Where is Metellus Cimber, let him go,
0 1541 And presently preferre his suite to Caesar
0 1542 
0 1543    Bru. He is addrest: presse neere, and second him
0 1544 
0 1545    Cin. Caska, you are the first that reares your hand
0 1546 
0 1547    Caes Are we all ready? What is now amisse,
0 1548 That Caesar and his Senate must redresse?
0 1549   Metel. Most high, most mighty, and most puisant Caesar
0 1550 Metellus Cymber throwes before thy Seate
0 1551 An humble heart
0 1552 
0 1553    Caes I must preuent thee Cymber:
0 1554 These couchings, and these lowly courtesies
0 1555 Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
0 1556 And turne pre-Ordinance, and first Decree
0 1557 Into the lane of Children. Be not fond,
0 1558 To thinke that Caesar beares such Rebell blood
0 1559 That will be thaw'd from the true quality
0 1560 With that which melteth Fooles, I meane sweet words,
0 1561 Low-crooked-curtsies, and base Spaniell fawning:
0 1562 Thy Brother by decree is banished:
0 1563 If thou doest bend, and pray, and fawne for him,
0 1564 I spurne thee like a Curre out of my way:
0 1565 Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
0 1566 Will he be satisfied
0 1567 
0 1568    Metel. Is there no voyce more worthy then my owne,
0 1569 To sound more sweetly in great Caesars eare,
0 1570 For the repealing of my banish'd Brother?
0 1571   Bru. I kisse thy hand, but not in flattery Caesar:
0 1572 Desiring thee, that Publius Cymber may
0 1573 Haue an immediate freedome of repeale
0 1574 
0 1575    Caes What Brutus?
0 1576   Cassi. Pardon Caesar: Caesar pardon:
0 1577 As lowe as to thy foote doth Cassius fall,
0 1578 To begge infranchisement for Publius Cymber
0 1579 
0 1580    Caes I could be well mou'd, if I were as you,
0 1581 If I could pray to mooue, Prayers would mooue me:
0 1582 But I am constant as the Northerne Starre,
0 1583 Of whose true fixt, and resting quality,
0 1584 There is no fellow in the Firmament.
0 1585 The Skies are painted with vnnumbred sparkes,
0 1586 They are all Fire, and euery one doth shine:
0 1587 But, there's but one in all doth hold his place.
0 1588 So, in the World; 'Tis furnish'd well with Men,
0 1589 And Men are Flesh and Blood, and apprehensiue;
0 1590 Yet in the number, I do know but One
0 1591 That vnassayleable holds on his Ranke,
0 1592 Vnshak'd of Motion: and that I am he,
0 1593 Let me a little shew it, euen in this:
0 1594 That I was constant Cymber should be banish'd,
0 1595 And constant do remaine to keepe him so
0 1596 
0 1597    Cinna. O Caesar
0 1598 
0 1599    Caes Hence: Wilt thou lift vp Olympus?
0 1600   Decius. Great Caesar
0 1601 
0 1602    Caes Doth not Brutus bootlesse kneele?
0 1603   Cask. Speake hands for me.
0 1604 
0 1605 They stab Caesar.
0 1606 
0 1607   Caes Et Tu Brute? - Then fall Caesar.
0 1608 
0 1609 Dyes
0 1610 
0 1611   Cin. Liberty, Freedome; Tyranny is dead,
0 1612 Run hence, proclaime, cry it about the Streets
0 1613 
0 1614    Cassi. Some to the common Pulpits, and cry out
0 1615 Liberty, Freedome, and Enfranchisement
0 1616 
0 1617    Bru. People and Senators, be not affrighted:
0 1618 Fly not, stand still: Ambitions debt is paid
0 1619 
0 1620    Cask. Go to the Pulpit Brutus
0 1621 
0 1622    Dec. And Cassius too
0 1623 
0 1624    Bru. Where's Publius?
0 1625   Cin. Heere, quite confounded with this mutiny
0 1626 
0 1627    Met. Stand fast together, least some Friend of Caesars
0 1628 Should chance-
0 1629   Bru. Talke not of standing. Publius good cheere,
0 1630 There is no harme intended to your person,
0 1631 Nor to no Roman else: so tell them Publius
0 1632 
0 1633    Cassi. And leaue vs Publius, least that the people
0 1634 Rushing on vs, should do your Age some mischiefe
0 1635 
0 1636    Bru. Do so, and let no man abide this deede,
0 1637 But we the Doers.
0 1638 Enter Trebonius
0 1639 
0 1640    Cassi. Where is Antony?
0 1641   Treb. Fled to his House amaz'd:
0 1642 Men, Wiues, and Children, stare, cry out, and run,
0 1643 As it were Doomesday
0 1644 
0 1645    Bru. Fates, we will know your pleasures:
0 1646 That we shall dye we know, 'tis but the time
0 1647 And drawing dayes out, that men stand vpon
0 1648 
0 1649    Cask. Why he that cuts off twenty yeares of life,
0 1650 Cuts off so many yeares of fearing death
0 1651 
0 1652    Bru. Grant that, and then is Death a Benefit:
0 1653 So are we Caesars Friends, that haue abridg'd
0 1654 His time of fearing death. Stoope Romans, stoope,
0 1655 And let vs bathe our hands in Caesars blood
0 1656 Vp to the Elbowes, and besmeare our Swords:
0 1657 Then walke we forth, euen to the Market place,
0 1658 And wauing our red Weapons o're our heads,
0 1659 Let's all cry Peace, Freedome, and Liberty
0 1660 
0 1661    Cassi. Stoop then, and wash. How many Ages hence
0 1662 Shall this our lofty Scene be acted ouer,
0 1663 In State vnborne, and Accents yet vnknowne?
0 1664   Bru. How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
0 1665 That now on Pompeyes Basis lye along,
0 1666 No worthier then the dust?
0 1667   Cassi. So oft as that shall be,
0 1668 So often shall the knot of vs be call'd,
0 1669 The Men that gaue their Country liberty
0 1670 
0 1671    Dec. What, shall we forth?
0 1672   Cassi. I, euery man away.
0 1673 Brutus shall leade, and we will grace his heeles
0 1674 With the most boldest, and best hearts of Rome.
0 1675 Enter a Seruant.
0 1676 
0 1677   Bru. Soft, who comes heere? A friend of Antonies
0 1678 
0 1679    Ser. Thus Brutus did my Master bid me kneele;
0 1680 Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall downe,
0 1681 And being prostrate, thus he bad me say:
0 1682 Brutus is Noble, Wise, Valiant, and Honest;
0 1683 Caesar was Mighty, Bold, Royall, and Louing:
0 1684 Say, I loue Brutus, and I honour him;
0 1685 Say, I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him, and lou'd him.
0 1686 If Brutus will vouchsafe, that Antony
0 1687 May safely come to him, and be resolu'd
0 1688 How Caesar hath deseru'd to lye in death,
0 1689 Mark Antony, shall not loue Caesar dead
0 1690 So well as Brutus liuing; but will follow
0 1691 The Fortunes and Affayres of Noble Brutus,
0 1692 Thorough the hazards of this vntrod State,
0 1693 With all true Faith. So sayes my Master Antony
0 1694 
0 1695    Bru. Thy Master is a Wise and Valiant Romane,
0 1696 I neuer thought him worse:
0 1697 Tell him, so please him come vnto this place
0 1698 He shall be satisfied: and by my Honor
0 1699 Depart vntouch'd
0 1700 
0 1701    Ser. Ile fetch him presently.
0 1702 
0 1703 Exit Seruant.
0 1704 
0 1705   Bru. I know that we shall haue him well to Friend
0 1706 
0 1707    Cassi. I wish we may: But yet haue I a minde
0 1708 That feares him much: and my misgiuing still
0 1709 Falles shrewdly to the purpose.
0 1710 Enter Antony.
0 1711 
0 1712   Bru. But heere comes Antony:
0 1713 Welcome Mark Antony
0 1714 
0 1715    Ant. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lye so lowe?
0 1716 Are all thy Conquests, Glories, Triumphes, Spoiles,
0 1717 Shrunke to this little Measure? Fare thee well.
0 1718 I know not Gentlemen what you intend,
0 1719 Who else must be let blood, who else is ranke:
0 1720 If I my selfe, there is no houre so fit
0 1721 As Caesars deaths houre; nor no Instrument
0 1722 Of halfe that worth, as those your Swords; made rich
0 1723 With the most Noble blood of all this World.
0 1724 I do beseech yee, if you beare me hard,
0 1725 Now, whil'st your purpled hands do reeke and smoake,
0 1726 Fulfill your pleasure. Liue a thousand yeeres,
0 1727 I shall not finde my selfe so apt to dye.
0 1728 No place will please me so, no meane of death,
0 1729 As heere by Caesar, and by you cut off,
0 1730 The Choice and Master Spirits of this Age
0 1731 
0 1732    Bru. O Antony! Begge not your death of vs:
0 1733 Though now we must appeare bloody and cruell,
0 1734 As by our hands, and this our present Acte
0 1735 You see we do: Yet see you but our hands,
0 1736 And this, the bleeding businesse they haue done:
0 1737 Our hearts you see not, they are pittifull:
0 1738 And pitty to the generall wrong of Rome,
0 1739 As fire driues out fire, so pitty, pitty
0 1740 Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
0 1741 To you, our Swords haue leaden points Marke Antony:
0 1742 Our Armes in strength of malice, and our Hearts
0 1743 Of Brothers temper, do receiue you in,
0 1744 With all kinde loue, good thoughts, and reuerence
0 1745 
0 1746    Cassi. Your voyce shall be as strong as any mans,
0 1747 In the disposing of new Dignities
0 1748 
0 1749    Bru. Onely be patient, till we haue appeas'd
0 1750 The Multitude, beside themselues with feare,
0 1751 And then, we will deliuer you the cause,
0 1752 Why I, that did loue Caesar when I strooke him,
0 1753 Haue thus proceeded
0 1754 
0 1755    Ant. I doubt not of your Wisedome:
0 1756 Let each man render me his bloody hand.
0 1757 First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you;
0 1758 Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand;
0 1759 Now Decius Brutus yours; now yours Metellus;
0 1760 Yours Cinna; and my valiant Caska, yours;
0 1761 Though last, not least in loue, yours good Trebonius.
0 1762 Gentlemen all: Alas, what shall I say,
0 1763 My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
0 1764 That one of two bad wayes you must conceit me,
0 1765 Either a Coward, or a Flatterer.
0 1766 That I did loue thee Caesar, O 'tis true:
0 1767 If then thy Spirit looke vpon vs now,
0 1768 Shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death,
0 1769 To see thy Antony making his peace,
0 1770 Shaking the bloody fingers of thy Foes?
0 1771 Most Noble, in the presence of thy Coarse,
0 1772 Had I as many eyes, as thou hast wounds,
0 1773 Weeping as fast as they streame forth thy blood,
0 1774 It would become me better, then to close
0 1775 In tearmes of Friendship with thine enemies.
0 1776 Pardon me Iulius, heere was't thou bay'd braue Hart,
0 1777 Heere did'st thou fall, and heere thy Hunters stand
0 1778 Sign'd in thy Spoyle, and Crimson'd in thy Lethee.
0 1779 O World! thou wast the Forrest to this Hart,
0 1780 And this indeed, O World, the Hart of thee.
0 1781 How like a Deere, stroken by many Princes,
0 1782 Dost thou heere lye?
0 1783   Cassi. Mark Antony
0 1784 
0 1785    Ant. Pardon me Caius Cassius:
0 1786 The Enemies of Caesar, shall say this:
0 1787 Then, in a Friend, it is cold Modestie
0 1788 
0 1789    Cassi. I blame you not for praising Caesar so.
0 1790 But what compact meane you to haue with vs?
0 1791 Will you be prick'd in number of our Friends,
0 1792 Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
0 1793   Ant. Therefore I tooke your hands, but was indeed
0 1794 Sway'd from the point, by looking downe on Caesar.
0 1795 Friends am I with you all, and loue you all,
0 1796 Vpon this hope, that you shall giue me Reasons,
0 1797 Why, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous
0 1798 
0 1799    Bru. Or else were this a sauage Spectacle:
0 1800 Our Reasons are so full of good regard,
0 1801 That were you Antony, the Sonne of Caesar,
0 1802 You should be satisfied
0 1803 
0 1804    Ant. That's all I seeke,
0 1805 And am moreouer sutor, that I may
0 1806 Produce his body to the Market-place,
0 1807 And in the Pulpit as becomes a Friend,
0 1808 Speake in the Order of his Funerall
0 1809 
0 1810    Bru. You shall Marke Antony
0 1811 
0 1812    Cassi. Brutus, a word with you:
0 1813 You know not what you do; Do not consent
0 1814 That Antony speake in his Funerall:
0 1815 Know you how much the people may be mou'd
0 1816 By that which he will vtter
0 1817 
0 1818    Bru. By your pardon:
0 1819 I will my selfe into the Pulpit first,
0 1820 And shew the reason of our Caesars death.
0 1821 What Antony shall speake, I will protest
0 1822 He speakes by leaue, and by permission:
0 1823 And that we are contented Caesar shall
0 1824 Haue all true Rites, and lawfull Ceremonies,
0 1825 It shall aduantage more, then do vs wrong
0 1826 
0 1827    Cassi. I know not what may fall, I like it not
0 1828 
0 1829    Bru. Mark Antony, heere take you Caesars body:
0 1830 You shall not in your Funerall speech blame vs,
0 1831 But speake all good you can deuise of Caesar,
0 1832 And say you doo't by our permission:
0 1833 Else shall you not haue any hand at all
0 1834 About his Funerall. And you shall speake
0 1835 In the same Pulpit whereto I am going,
0 1836 After my speech is ended
0 1837 
0 1838    Ant. Be it so:
0 1839 I do desire no more
0 1840 
0 1841    Bru. Prepare the body then, and follow vs.
0 1842 
0 1843 Exeunt.
0 1844 
0 1845 Manet Antony.
0 1846 
0 1847 O pardon me, thou bleeding peece of Earth:
0 1848 That I am meeke and gentle with these Butchers.
0 1849 Thou art the Ruines of the Noblest man
0 1850 That euer liued in the Tide of Times.
0 1851 Woe to the hand that shed this costly Blood.
0 1852 Ouer thy wounds, now do I Prophesie,
0 1853 (Which like dumbe mouthes do ope their Ruby lips,
0 1854 To begge the voyce and vtterance of my Tongue)
0 1855 A Curse shall light vpon the limbes of men;
0 1856 Domesticke Fury, and fierce Ciuill strife,
0 1857 Shall cumber all the parts of Italy:
0 1858 Blood and destruction shall be so in vse,
0 1859 And dreadfull Obiects so familiar,
0 1860 That Mothers shall but smile, when they behold
0 1861 Their Infants quartered with the hands of Warre:
0 1862 All pitty choak'd with custome of fell deeds,
0 1863 And Caesars Spirit ranging for Reuenge,
0 1864 With Ate by his side, come hot from Hell,
0 1865 Shall in these Confines, with a Monarkes voyce,
0 1866 Cry hauocke, and let slip the Dogges of Warre,
0 1867 That this foule deede, shall smell aboue the earth
0 1868 With Carrion men, groaning for Buriall.
0 1869 Enter Octauio's Seruant.
0 1870 
0 1871 You serue Octauius Caesar, do you not?
0 1872   Ser. I do Marke Antony
0 1873 
0 1874    Ant. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
0 1875 
0 1876    Ser. He did receiue his Letters, and is comming,
0 1877 And bid me say to you by word of mouth-
0 1878 O Caesar!
0 1879   Ant. Thy heart is bigge: get thee a-part and weepe:
0 1880 Passion I see is catching from mine eyes,
0 1881 Seeing those Beads of sorrow stand in thine,
0 1882 Began to water. Is thy Master comming?
0 1883   Ser. He lies to night within seuen Leagues of Rome
0 1884 
0 1885    Ant. Post backe with speede,
0 1886 And tell him what hath chanc'd:
0 1887 Heere is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
0 1888 No Rome of safety for Octauius yet,
0 1889 Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay a-while,
0 1890 Thou shalt not backe, till I haue borne this course
0 1891 Into the Market place: There shall I try
0 1892 In my Oration, how the People take
0 1893 The cruell issue of these bloody men,
0 1894 According to the which, thou shalt discourse
0 1895 To yong Octauius, of the state of things.
0 1896 Lend me your hand.
0 1897 
0 1898 Exeunt.
0 1899 
0 1900 Enter Brutus and goes into the Pulpit, and Cassius, with the
0 1901 Plebeians.
0 1902 
0 1903   Ple. We will be satisfied: let vs be satisfied
0 1904 
0 1905    Bru. Then follow me, and giue me Audience friends.
0 1906 Cassius go you into the other streete,
0 1907 And part the Numbers:
0 1908 Those that will heare me speake, let 'em stay heere;
0 1909 Those that will follow Cassius, go with him,
0 1910 And publike Reasons shall be rendred
0 1911 Of Caesars death
0 1912 
0 1913    1.Ple. I will heare Brutus speake
0 1914 
0 1915    2. I will heare Cassius, and compare their Reasons,
0 1916 When seuerally we heare them rendred
0 1917 
0 1918    3. The Noble Brutus is ascended: Silence
0 1919 
0 1920    Bru. Be patient till the last.
0 1921 Romans, Countrey-men, and Louers, heare mee for my
0 1922 cause, and be silent, that you may heare. Beleeue me for
0 1923 mine Honor, and haue respect to mine Honor, that you
0 1924 may beleeue. Censure me in your Wisedom, and awake
0 1925 your Senses, that you may the better Iudge. If there bee
0 1926 any in this Assembly, any deere Friend of Caesars, to him
0 1927 I say, that Brutus loue to Caesar, was no lesse then his. If
0 1928 then, that Friend demand, why Brutus rose against Caesar,
0 1929 this is my answer: Not that I lou'd Caesar lesse, but
0 1930 that I lou'd Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were liuing,
0 1931 and dye all Slaues; then that Caesar were dead, to
0 1932 liue all Free-men? As Caesar lou'd mee, I weepe for him;
0 1933 as he was Fortunate, I reioyce at it; as he was Valiant, I
0 1934 honour him: But, as he was Ambitious, I slew him. There
0 1935 is Teares, for his Loue: Ioy, for his Fortune: Honor, for
0 1936 his Valour: and Death, for his Ambition. Who is heere
0 1937 so base, that would be a Bondman? If any, speak, for him
0 1938 haue I offended. Who is heere so rude, that would not
0 1939 be a Roman? If any, speak, for him haue I offended. Who
0 1940 is heere so vile, that will not loue his Countrey? If any,
0 1941 speake, for him haue I offended. I pause for a Reply
0 1942 
0 1943    All. None Brutus, none
0 1944 
0 1945    Brutus. Then none haue I offended. I haue done no
0 1946 more to Caesar, then you shall do to Brutus. The Question
0 1947 of his death, is inroll'd in the Capitoll: his Glory not
0 1948 extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforc'd,
0 1949 for which he suffered death.
0 1950 Enter Mark Antony, with Caesars body.
0 1951 
0 1952 Heere comes his Body, mourn'd by Marke Antony, who
0 1953 though he had no hand in his death, shall receiue the benefit
0 1954 of his dying, a place in the Co[m]monwealth, as which
0 1955 of you shall not. With this I depart, that as I slewe my
0 1956 best Louer for the good of Rome, I haue the same Dagger
0 1957 for my selfe, when it shall please my Country to need
0 1958 my death
0 1959 
0 1960    All. Liue Brutus, liue, liue
0 1961 
0 1962    1. Bring him with Triumph home vnto his house
0 1963 
0 1964    2. Giue him a Statue with his Ancestors
0 1965 
0 1966    3. Let him be Caesar
0 1967 
0 1968    4. Caesars better parts,
0 1969 Shall be Crown'd in Brutus
0 1970 
0 1971    1. Wee'l bring him to his House,
0 1972 With Showts and Clamors
0 1973 
0 1974    Bru. My Country-men
0 1975 
0 1976    2. Peace, silence, Brutus speakes
0 1977 
0 1978    1. Peace ho
0 1979 
0 1980    Bru. Good Countrymen, let me depart alone,
0 1981 And (for my sake) stay heere with Antony:
0 1982 Do grace to Caesars Corpes, and grace his Speech
0 1983 Tending to Caesars Glories, which Marke Antony
0 1984 (By our permission) is allow'd to make.
0 1985 I do intreat you, not a man depart,
0 1986 Saue I alone, till Antony haue spoke.
0 1987 
0 1988 Exit
0 1989 
0 1990   1 Stay ho, and let vs heare Mark Antony
0 1991 
0 1992    3 Let him go vp into the publike Chaire,
0 1993 Wee'l heare him: Noble Antony go vp
0 1994 
0 1995    Ant. For Brutus sake, I am beholding to you
0 1996 
0 1997    4 What does he say of Brutus?
0 1998   3 He sayes, for Brutus sake
0 1999 He findes himselfe beholding to vs all
0 2000 
0 2001    4 'Twere best he speake no harme of Brutus heere?
0 2002   1 This Caesar was a Tyrant
0 2003 
0 2004    3 Nay that's certaine:
0 2005 We are blest that Rome is rid of him
0 2006 
0 2007    2 Peace, let vs heare what Antony can say
0 2008 
0 2009    Ant. You gentle Romans
0 2010 
0 2011    All. Peace hoe, let vs heare him
0 2012 
0 2013    An. Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears:
0 2014 I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him:
0 2015 The euill that men do, liues after them,
0 2016 The good is oft enterred with their bones,
0 2017 So let it be with Caesar. The Noble Brutus,
0 2018 Hath told you Caesar was Ambitious:
0 2019 If it were so, it was a greeuous Fault,
0 2020 And greeuously hath Caesar answer'd it.
0 2021 Heere, vnder leaue of Brutus, and the rest
0 2022 (For Brutus is an Honourable man,
0 2023 So are they all; all Honourable men)
0 2024 Come I to speake in Caesars Funerall.
0 2025 He was my Friend, faithfull, and iust to me;
0 2026 But Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious,
0 2027 And Brutus is an Honourable man.
0 2028 He hath brought many Captiues home to Rome,
0 2029 Whose Ransomes, did the generall Coffers fill:
0 2030 Did this in Caesar seeme Ambitious?
0 2031 When that the poore haue cry'de, Caesar hath wept:
0 2032 Ambition should be made of sterner stuffe,
0 2033 Yet Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious:
0 2034 And Brutus is an Honourable man.
0 2035 You all did see, that on the Lupercall,
0 2036 I thrice presented him a Kingly Crowne,
0 2037 Which he did thrice refuse. Was this Ambition?
0 2038 Yet Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious:
0 2039 And sure he is an Honourable man.
0 2040 I speake not to disprooue what Brutus spoke,
0 2041 But heere I am, to speake what I do know;
0 2042 You all did loue him once, not without cause,
0 2043 What cause with-holds you then, to mourne for him?
0 2044 O Iudgement! thou are fled to brutish Beasts,
0 2045 And Men haue lost their Reason. Beare with me,
0 2046 My heart is in the Coffin there with Caesar,
0 2047 And I must pawse, till it come backe to me
0 2048 
0 2049    1 Me thinkes there is much reason in his sayings
0 2050 
0 2051    2 If thou consider rightly of the matter,
0 2052 Caesar ha's had great wrong
0 2053 
0 2054    3 Ha's hee Masters? I feare there will a worse come in his place
0 2055 
0 2056    4. Mark'd ye his words? he would not take y Crown,
0 2057 Therefore 'tis certaine, he was not Ambitious
0 2058 
0 2059    1. If it be found so, some will deere abide it
0 2060 
0 2061    2. Poore soule, his eyes are red as fire with weeping
0 2062 
0 2063    3. There's not a Nobler man in Rome then Antony
0 2064 
0 2065    4. Now marke him, he begins againe to speake
0 2066 
0 2067    Ant. But yesterday, the word of Caesar might
0 2068 Haue stood against the World: Now lies he there,
0 2069 And none so poore to do him reuerence.
0 2070 O Maisters! If I were dispos'd to stirre
0 2071 Your hearts and mindes to Mutiny and Rage,
0 2072 I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong:
0 2073 Who (you all know) are Honourable men.
0 2074 I will not do them wrong: I rather choose
0 2075 To wrong the dead, to wrong my selfe and you,
0 2076 Then I will wrong such Honourable men.
0 2077 But heere's a Parchment, with the Seale of Caesar,
0 2078 I found it in his Closset, 'tis his Will:
0 2079 Let but the Commons heare this Testament:
0 2080 (Which pardon me) I do not meane to reade,
0 2081 And they would go and kisse dead Caesars wounds,
0 2082 And dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood;
0 2083 Yea, begge a haire of him for Memory,
0 2084 And dying, mention it within their Willes,
0 2085 Bequeathing it as a rich Legacie
0 2086 Vnto their issue
0 2087 
0 2088    4 Wee'l heare the Will, reade it Marke Antony
0 2089 
0 2090    All. The Will, the Will; we will heare Caesars Will
0 2091 
0 2092    Ant. Haue patience gentle Friends, I must not read it.
0 2093 It is not meete you know how Caesar lou'd you:
0 2094 You are not Wood, you are not Stones, but men:
0 2095 And being men, hearing the Will of Caesar,
0 2096 It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
0 2097 'Tis good you know not that you are his Heires,
0 2098 For if you should, O what would come of it?
0 2099   4 Read the Will, wee'l heare it Antony:
0 2100 You shall reade vs the Will, Caesars Will
0 2101 
0 2102    Ant. Will you be Patient? Will you stay a-while?
0 2103 I haue o're-shot my selfe to tell you of it,
0 2104 I feare I wrong the Honourable men,
0 2105 Whose Daggers haue stabb'd Caesar: I do feare it
0 2106 
0 2107    4 They were Traitors: Honourable men?
0 2108   All. The Will, the Testament
0 2109 
0 2110    2 They were Villaines, Murderers: the Will, read the
0 2111 Will
0 2112 
0 2113    Ant. You will compell me then to read the Will:
0 2114 Then make a Ring about the Corpes of Caesar,
0 2115 And let me shew you him that made the Will:
0 2116 Shall I descend? And will you giue me leaue?
0 2117   All. Come downe
0 2118 
0 2119    2 Descend
0 2120 
0 2121    3 You shall haue leaue
0 2122 
0 2123    4 A Ring, stand round
0 2124 
0 2125    1 Stand from the Hearse, stand from the Body
0 2126 
0 2127    2 Roome for Antony, most Noble Antony
0 2128 
0 2129    Ant. Nay presse not so vpon me, stand farre off
0 2130 
0 2131    All. Stand backe: roome, beare backe
0 2132 
0 2133    Ant. If you haue teares, prepare to shed them now.
0 2134 You all do know this Mantle, I remember
0 2135 The first time euer Caesar put it on,
0 2136 'Twas on a Summers Euening in his Tent,
0 2137 That day he ouercame the Neruij.
0 2138 Looke, in this place ran Cassius Dagger through:
0 2139 See what a rent the enuious Caska made:
0 2140 Through this, the wel-beloued Brutus stabb'd,
0 2141 And as he pluck'd his cursed Steele away:
0 2142 Marke how the blood of Caesar followed it,
0 2143 As rushing out of doores, to be resolu'd
0 2144 If Brutus so vnkindely knock'd, or no:
0 2145 For Brutus, as you know, was Caesars Angel.
0 2146 Iudge, O you Gods, how deerely Caesar lou'd him:
0 2147 This was the most vnkindest cut of all.
0 2148 For when the Noble Caesar saw him stab,
0 2149 Ingratitude, more strong then Traitors armes,
0 2150 Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his Mighty heart,
0 2151 And in his Mantle, muffling vp his face,
0 2152 Euen at the Base of Pompeyes Statue
0 2153 (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell.
0 2154 O what a fall was there, my Countrymen?
0 2155 Then I, and you, and all of vs fell downe,
0 2156 Whil'st bloody Treason flourish'd ouer vs.
0 2157 O now you weepe, and I perceiue you feele
0 2158 The dint of pitty: These are gracious droppes.
0 2159 Kinde Soules, what weepe you, when you but behold
0 2160 Our Caesars Vesture wounded? Looke you heere,
0 2161 Heere is Himselfe, marr'd as you see with Traitors
0 2162 
0 2163    1. O pitteous spectacle!
0 2164   2. O Noble Caesar!
0 2165   3. O wofull day!
0 2166   4. O Traitors, Villaines!
0 2167   1. O most bloody sight!
0 2168   2. We will be reueng'd: Reuenge
0 2169 About, seeke, burne, fire, kill, slay,
0 2170 Let not a Traitor liue
0 2171 
0 2172    Ant. Stay Country-men
0 2173 
0 2174    1. Peace there, heare the Noble Antony
0 2175 
0 2176    2. Wee'l heare him, wee'l follow him, wee'l dy with
0 2177 him
0 2178 
0 2179    Ant. Good Friends, sweet Friends, let me not stirre you vp
0 2180 To such a sodaine Flood of Mutiny:
0 2181 They that haue done this Deede, are honourable.
0 2182 What priuate greefes they haue, alas I know not,
0 2183 That made them do it: They are Wise, and Honourable,
0 2184 And will no doubt with Reasons answer you.
0 2185 I come not (Friends) to steale away your hearts,
0 2186 I am no Orator, as Brutus is:
0 2187 But (as you know me all) a plaine blunt man
0 2188 That loue my Friend, and that they know full well,
0 2189 That gaue me publike leaue to speake of him:
0 2190 For I haue neyther writ nor words, nor worth,
0 2191 Action, nor Vtterance, nor the power of Speech,
0 2192 To stirre mens Blood. I onely speake right on:
0 2193 I tell you that, which you your selues do know,
0 2194 Shew you sweet Caesars wounds, poor poor dum mouths
0 2195 And bid them speake for me: But were I Brutus,
0 2196 And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
0 2197 Would ruffle vp your Spirits, and put a Tongue
0 2198 In euery Wound of Caesar, that should moue
0 2199 The stones of Rome, to rise and Mutiny
0 2200 
0 2201    All. Wee'l Mutiny
0 2202 
0 2203    1 Wee'l burne the house of Brutus
0 2204 
0 2205    3 Away then, come, seeke the Conspirators
0 2206 
0 2207    Ant. Yet heare me Countrymen, yet heare me speake
0 2208   All. Peace hoe, heare Antony, most Noble Antony
0 2209 
0 2210    Ant. Why Friends, you go to do you know not what:
0 2211 Wherein hath Caesar thus deseru'd your loues?
0 2212 Alas you know not, I must tell you then:
0 2213 You haue forgot the Will I told you of
0 2214 
0 2215    All. Most true, the Will, let's stay and heare the Wil
0 2216 
0 2217    Ant. Heere is the Will, and vnder Caesars Seale:
0 2218 To euery Roman Citizen he giues,
0 2219 To euery seuerall man, seuenty fiue Drachmaes
0 2220 
0 2221    2 Ple. Most Noble Caesar, wee'l reuenge his death
0 2222 
0 2223    3 Ple. O Royall Caesar
0 2224 
0 2225    Ant. Heare me with patience
0 2226 
0 2227    All. Peace hoe
0 2228   Ant. Moreouer, he hath left you all his Walkes,
0 2229 His priuate Arbors, and new-planted Orchards,
0 2230 On this side Tyber, he hath left them you,
0 2231 And to your heyres for euer: common pleasures
0 2232 To walke abroad, and recreate your selues.
0 2233 Heere was a Caesar: when comes such another?
0 2234   1.Ple. Neuer, neuer: come, away, away:
0 2235 Wee'l burne his body in the holy place,
0 2236 And with the Brands fire the Traitors houses.
0 2237 Take vp the body
0 2238 
0 2239    2.Ple. Go fetch fire
0 2240 
0 2241    3.Ple. Plucke downe Benches
0 2242 
0 2243    4.Ple. Plucke downe Formes, Windowes, any thing.
0 2244 
0 2245 Exit Plebeians.
0 2246 
0 2247   Ant. Now let it worke: Mischeefe thou art a-foot,
0 2248 Take thou what course thou wilt.
0 2249 How now Fellow?
0 2250 Enter Seruant.
0 2251 
0 2252   Ser. Sir, Octauius is already come to Rome
0 2253 
0 2254    Ant. Where is hee?
0 2255   Ser. He and Lepidus are at Caesars house
0 2256 
0 2257    Ant. And thither will I straight, to visit him:
0 2258 He comes vpon a wish. Fortune is merry,
0 2259 And in this mood will giue vs any thing
0 2260 
0 2261    Ser. I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
0 2262 Are rid like Madmen through the Gates of Rome
0 2263 
0 2264    Ant. Belike they had some notice of the people
0 2265 How I had moued them. Bring me to Octauius.
0 2266 
0 2267 Exeunt.
0 2268 
0 2269 Enter Cinna the Poet, and after him the Plebeians.
0 2270 
0 2271   Cinna. I dreamt to night, that I did feast with Caesar,
0 2272 And things vnluckily charge my Fantasie:
0 2273 I haue no will to wander foorth of doores,
0 2274 Yet something leads me foorth
0 2275 
0 2276    1. What is your name?
0 2277   2. Whether are you going?
0 2278   3. Where do you dwell?
0 2279   4. Are you a married man, or a Batchellor?
0 2280   2. Answer euery man directly
0 2281 
0 2282    1. I, and breefely
0 2283 
0 2284    4. I, and wisely
0 2285 
0 2286    3. I, and truly, you were best
0 2287 
0 2288    Cin. What is my name? Whether am I going? Where
0 2289 do I dwell? Am I a married man, or a Batchellour? Then
0 2290 to answer euery man, directly and breefely, wisely and
0 2291 truly: wisely I say, I am a Batchellor
0 2292 
0 2293    2 That's as much as to say, they are fooles that marrie:
0 2294 you'l beare me a bang for that I feare: proceede directly
0 2295 
0 2296    Cinna. Directly I am going to Caesars Funerall
0 2297 
0 2298    1. As a Friend, or an Enemy?
0 2299   Cinna. As a friend
0 2300 
0 2301    2. That matter is answered directly
0 2302 
0 2303    4. For your dwelling: breefely
0 2304 
0 2305    Cinna. Breefely, I dwell by the Capitoll
0 2306 
0 2307    3. Your name sir, truly
0 2308 
0 2309    Cinna. Truly, my name is Cinna
0 2310 
0 2311    1. Teare him to peeces, hee's a Conspirator
0 2312 
0 2313    Cinna. I am Cinna the Poet, I am Cinna the Poet
0 2314 
0 2315    4. Teare him for his bad verses, teare him for his bad
0 2316 Verses
0 2317 
0 2318    Cin. I am not Cinna the Conspirator
0 2319 
0 2320    4. It is no matter, his name's Cinna, plucke but his
0 2321 name out of his heart, and turne him going
0 2322 
0 2323    3. Teare him, tear him; Come Brands hoe, Firebrands:
0 2324 to Brutus, to Cassius, burne all. Some to Decius House,
0 2325 and some to Caska's; some to Ligarius: Away, go.
0 2326 
0 2327 Exeunt. all the Plebeians.
0 2328 
0 2329 
0 2330 Actus Quartus.
0 2331 
0 2332 Enter Antony, Octauius, and Lepidus.
0 2333 
0 2334   Ant. These many then shall die, their names are prickt
0 2335   Octa. Your Brother too must dye: consent you Lepidus?
0 2336   Lep. I do consent
0 2337 
0 2338    Octa. Pricke him downe Antony
0 2339 
0 2340    Lep. Vpon condition Publius shall not liue,
0 2341 Who is your Sisters sonne, Marke Antony
0 2342 
0 2343    Ant. He shall not liue; looke, with a spot I dam him.
0 2344 But Lepidus, go you to Caesars house:
0 2345 Fetch the Will hither, and we shall determine
0 2346 How to cut off some charge in Legacies
0 2347 
0 2348    Lep. What? shall I finde you heere?
0 2349   Octa. Or heere, or at the Capitoll.
0 2350 
0 2351 Exit Lepidus
0 2352 
0 2353   Ant. This is a slight vnmeritable man,
0 2354 Meet to be sent on Errands: is it fit
0 2355 The three-fold World diuided, he should stand
0 2356 One of the three to share it?
0 2357   Octa. So you thought him,
0 2358 And tooke his voyce who should be prickt to dye
0 2359 In our blacke Sentence and Proscription
0 2360 
0 2361    Ant. Octauius, I haue seene more dayes then you,
0 2362 And though we lay these Honours on this man,
0 2363 To ease our selues of diuers sland'rous loads,
0 2364 He shall but beare them, as the Asse beares Gold,
0 2365 To groane and swet vnder the Businesse,
0 2366 Either led or driuen, as we point the way:
0 2367 And hauing brought our Treasure, where we will,
0 2368 Then take we downe his Load, and turne him off
0 2369 (Like to the empty Asse) to shake his eares,
0 2370 And graze in Commons
0 2371 
0 2372    Octa. You may do your will:
0 2373 But hee's a tried, and valiant Souldier
0 2374 
0 2375    Ant. So is my Horse Octauius, and for that
0 2376 I do appoint him store of Prouender.
0 2377 It is a Creature that I teach to fight,
0 2378 To winde, to stop, to run directly on:
0 2379 His corporall Motion, gouern'd by my Spirit,
0 2380 And in some taste, is Lepidus but so:
0 2381 He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth:
0 2382 A barren spirited Fellow; one that feeds
0 2383 On Obiects, Arts, and Imitations.
0 2384 Which out of vse, and stal'de by other men
0 2385 Begin his fashion. Do not talke of him,
0 2386 But as a property: and now Octauius,
0 2387 Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius
0 2388 Are leuying Powers; We must straight make head:
0 2389 Therefore let our Alliance be combin'd,
0 2390 Our best Friends made, our meanes stretcht,
0 2391 And let vs presently go sit in Councell,
0 2392 How couert matters may be best disclos'd,
0 2393 And open Perils surest answered
0 2394 
0 2395    Octa. Let vs do so: for we are at the stake,
0 2396 And bayed about with many Enemies,
0 2397 And some that smile haue in their hearts I feare
0 2398 Millions of Mischeefes.
0 2399 
0 2400 Exeunt.
0 2401 
0 2402 Drum. Enter Brutus, Lucillius, and the Army. Titinius and
0 2403 Pindarus meete
0 2404 them.
0 2405 
0 2406   Bru. Stand ho
0 2407 
0 2408    Lucil. Giue the word ho, and Stand
0 2409 
0 2410    Bru. What now Lucillius, is Cassius neere?
0 2411   Lucil. He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
0 2412 To do you salutation from his Master
0 2413 
0 2414    Bru. He greets me well. Your Master Pindarus
0 2415 In his owne change, or by ill Officers,
0 2416 Hath giuen me some worthy cause to wish
0 2417 Things done, vndone: But if he be at hand
0 2418 I shall be satisfied
0 2419 
0 2420    Pin. I do not doubt
0 2421 But that my Noble Master will appeare
0 2422 Such as he is, full of regard, and Honour
0 2423 
0 2424    Bru. He is not doubted. A word Lucillius
0 2425 How he receiu'd you: let me be resolu'd
0 2426 
0 2427    Lucil. With courtesie, and with respect enough,
0 2428 But not with such familiar instances,
0 2429 Nor with such free and friendly Conference
0 2430 As he hath vs'd of old
0 2431 
0 2432    Bru. Thou hast describ'd
0 2433 A hot Friend, cooling: Euer note Lucillius,
0 2434 When Loue begins to sicken and decay
0 2435 It vseth an enforced Ceremony.
0 2436 There are no trickes, in plaine and simple Faith:
0 2437 But hollow men, like Horses hot at hand,
0 2438 Make gallant shew, and promise of their Mettle:
0 2439 
0 2440 Low March within.
0 2441 
0 2442 But when they should endure the bloody Spurre,
0 2443 They fall their Crests, and like deceitfull Iades
0 2444 Sinke in the Triall. Comes his Army on?
0 2445   Lucil. They meane this night in Sardis to be quarter'd:
0 2446 The greater part, the Horse in generall
0 2447 Are come with Cassius.
0 2448 Enter Cassius and his Powers.
0 2449 
0 2450   Bru. Hearke, he is arriu'd:
0 2451 March gently on to meete him
0 2452 
0 2453    Cassi. Stand ho
0 2454 
0 2455    Bru. Stand ho, speake the word along.
0 2456 Stand.
0 2457 Stand.
0 2458 Stand
0 2459 
0 2460    Cassi. Most Noble Brother, you haue done me wrong
0 2461 
0 2462    Bru. Iudge me you Gods; wrong I mine Enemies?
0 2463 And if not so, how should I wrong a Brother
0 2464 
0 2465    Cassi. Brutus, this sober forme of yours, hides wrongs,
0 2466 And when you do them-
0 2467   Brut. Cassius, be content,
0 2468 Speake your greefes softly, I do know you well.
0 2469 Before the eyes of both our Armies heere
0 2470 (Which should perceiue nothing but Loue from vs)
0 2471 Let vs not wrangle. Bid them moue away:
0 2472 Then in my Tent Cassius enlarge your Greefes,
0 2473 And I will giue you Audience
0 2474 
0 2475    Cassi. Pindarus,
0 2476 Bid our Commanders leade their Charges off
0 2477 A little from this ground
0 2478 
0 2479    Bru. Lucillius, do you the like, and let no man
0 2480 Come to our Tent, till we haue done our Conference.
0 2481 Let Lucius and Titinius guard our doore.
0 2482 
0 2483 Exeunt.
0 2484 
0 2485 Manet Brutus and Cassius.
0 2486 
0 2487   Cassi. That you haue wrong'd me, doth appear in this:
0 2488 You haue condemn'd, and noted Lucius Pella
0 2489 For taking Bribes heere of the Sardians;
0 2490 Wherein my Letters, praying on his side,
0 2491 Because I knew the man was slighted off
0 2492 
0 2493    Bru. You wrong'd your selfe to write in such a case
0 2494 
0 2495    Cassi. In such a time as this, it is not meet
0 2496 That euery nice offence should beare his Comment
0 2497 
0 2498    Bru. Let me tell you Cassius, you your selfe
0 2499 Are much condemn'd to haue an itching Palme,
0 2500 To sell, and Mart your Offices for Gold
0 2501 To Vndeseruers
0 2502 
0 2503    Cassi. I, an itching Palme?
0 2504 You know that you are Brutus that speakes this,
0 2505 Or by the Gods, this speech were else your last
0 2506 
0 2507    Bru. The name of Cassius Honors this corruption,
0 2508 And Chasticement doth therefore hide his head
0 2509 
0 2510    Cassi. Chasticement?
0 2511   Bru. Remember March, the Ides of March reme[m]ber:
0 2512 Did not great Iulius bleede for Iustice sake?
0 2513 What Villaine touch'd his body, that did stab,
0 2514 And not for Iustice? What? Shall one of Vs,
0 2515 That strucke the Formost man of all this World,
0 2516 But for supporting Robbers: shall we now,
0 2517 Contaminate our fingers, with base Bribes?
0 2518 And sell the mighty space of our large Honors
0 2519 For so much trash, as may be grasped thus?
0 2520 I had rather be a Dogge, and bay the Moone,
0 2521 Then such a Roman
0 2522 
0 2523    Cassi. Brutus, baite not me,
0 2524 Ile not indure it: you forget your selfe
0 2525 To hedge me in. I am a Souldier, I,
0 2526 Older in practice, Abler then your selfe
0 2527 To make Conditions
0 2528 
0 2529    Bru. Go too: you are not Cassius
0 2530 
0 2531    Cassi. I am
0 2532 
0 2533    Bru. I say, you are not
0 2534 
0 2535    Cassi. Vrge me no more, I shall forget my selfe:
0 2536 Haue minde vpon your health: Tempt me no farther
0 2537 
0 2538    Bru. Away slight man
0 2539 
0 2540    Cassi. Is't possible?
0 2541   Bru. Heare me, for I will speake.
0 2542 Must I giue way, and roome to your rash Choller?
0 2543 Shall I be frighted, when a Madman stares?
0 2544   Cassi. O ye Gods, ye Gods, Must I endure all this?
0 2545   Bru. All this? I more: Fret till your proud hart break.
0 2546 Go shew your Slaues how Chollericke you are,
0 2547 And make your Bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?
0 2548 Must I obserue you? Must I stand and crouch
0 2549 Vnder your Testie Humour? By the Gods,
0 2550 You shall digest the Venom of your Spleene
0 2551 Though it do Split you. For, from this day forth,
0 2552 Ile vse you for my Mirth, yea for my Laughter
0 2553 When you are Waspish
0 2554 
0 2555    Cassi. Is it come to this?
0 2556   Bru. You say, you are a better Souldier:
0 2557 Let it appeare so; make your vaunting true,
0 2558 And it shall please me well. For mine owne part,
0 2559 I shall be glad to learne of Noble men
0 2560 
0 2561    Cass. You wrong me euery way:
0 2562 You wrong me Brutus:
0 2563 I saide, an Elder Souldier, not a Better.
0 2564 Did I say Better?
0 2565   Bru. If you did, I care not
0 2566 
0 2567    Cass. When Caesar liu'd, he durst not thus haue mou'd me
0 2568 
0 2569    Brut. Peace, peace, you durst not so haue tempted him
0 2570 
0 2571    Cassi. I durst not
0 2572 
0 2573    Bru. No
0 2574 
0 2575    Cassi. What? durst not tempt him?
0 2576   Bru. For your life you durst not
0 2577 
0 2578    Cassi. Do not presume too much vpon my Loue,
0 2579 I may do that I shall be sorry for
0 2580 
0 2581    Bru. You haue done that you should be sorry for.
0 2582 There is no terror Cassius in your threats:
0 2583 For I am Arm'd so strong in Honesty,
0 2584 That they passe by me, as the idle winde,
0 2585 Which I respect not. I did send to you
0 2586 For certaine summes of Gold, which you deny'd me,
0 2587 For I can raise no money by vile meanes:
0 2588 By Heauen, I had rather Coine my Heart,
0 2589 And drop my blood for Drachmaes, then to wring
0 2590 From the hard hands of Peazants, their vile trash
0 2591 By any indirection. I did send
0 2592 To you for Gold to pay my Legions,
0 2593 Which you deny'd me: was that done like Cassius?
0 2594 Should I haue answer'd Caius Cassius so?
0 2595 When Marcus Brutus growes so Couetous,
0 2596 To locke such Rascall Counters from his Friends,
0 2597 Be ready Gods with all your Thunder-bolts,
0 2598 Dash him to peeces
0 2599 
0 2600    Cassi. I deny'd you not
0 2601 
0 2602    Bru. You did
0 2603 
0 2604    Cassi. I did not. He was but a Foole
0 2605 That brought my answer back. Brutus hath riu'd my hart:
0 2606 A Friend should beare his Friends infirmities;
0 2607 But Brutus makes mine greater then they are
0 2608 
0 2609    Bru. I do not, till you practice them on me
0 2610 
0 2611    Cassi. You loue me not
0 2612 
0 2613    Bru. I do not like your faults
0 2614 
0 2615    Cassi. A friendly eye could neuer see such faults
0 2616 
0 2617    Bru. A Flatterers would not, though they do appeare
0 2618 As huge as high Olympus
0 2619 
0 2620    Cassi. Come Antony, and yong Octauius come,
0 2621 Reuenge your selues alone on Cassius,
0 2622 For Cassius is a-weary of the World:
0 2623 Hated by one he loues, brau'd by his Brother,
0 2624 Check'd like a bondman, all his faults obseru'd,
0 2625 Set in a Note-booke, learn'd, and con'd by roate
0 2626 To cast into my Teeth. O I could weepe
0 2627 My Spirit from mine eyes. There is my Dagger,
0 2628 And heere my naked Breast: Within, a Heart
0 2629 Deerer then Pluto's Mine, Richer then Gold:
0 2630 If that thou bee'st a Roman, take it foorth.
0 2631 I that deny'd thee Gold, will giue my Heart:
0 2632 Strike as thou did'st at Caesar: For I know,
0 2633 When thou did'st hate him worst, y loued'st him better
0 2634 Then euer thou loued'st Cassius
0 2635 
0 2636    Bru. Sheath your Dagger:
0 2637 Be angry when you will, it shall haue scope:
0 2638 Do what you will, Dishonor, shall be Humour.
0 2639 O Cassius, you are yoaked with a Lambe
0 2640 That carries Anger, as the Flint beares fire,
0 2641 Who much inforced, shewes a hastie Sparke,
0 2642 And straite is cold agen
0 2643 
0 2644    Cassi. Hath Cassius liu'd
0 2645 To be but Mirth and Laughter to his Brutus,
0 2646 When greefe and blood ill temper'd, vexeth him?
0 2647   Bru. When I spoke that, I was ill temper'd too
0 2648 
0 2649    Cassi. Do you confesse so much? Giue me your hand
0 2650 
0 2651    Bru. And my heart too
0 2652 
0 2653    Cassi. O Brutus!
0 2654   Bru. What's the matter?
0 2655   Cassi. Haue not you loue enough to beare with me,
0 2656 When that rash humour which my Mother gaue me
0 2657 Makes me forgetfull
0 2658 
0 2659    Bru. Yes Cassius, and from henceforth
0 2660 When you are ouer-earnest with your Brutus,
0 2661 Hee'l thinke your Mother chides, and leaue you so.
0 2662 Enter a Poet.
0 2663 
0 2664   Poet. Let me go in to see the Generals,
0 2665 There is some grudge betweene 'em, 'tis not meete
0 2666 They be alone
0 2667 
0 2668    Lucil. You shall not come to them
0 2669 
0 2670    Poet. Nothing but death shall stay me
0 2671 
0 2672    Cas. How now? What's the matter?
0 2673   Poet. For shame you Generals; what do you meane?
0 2674 Loue, and be Friends, as two such men should bee,
0 2675 For I haue seene more yeeres I'me sure then yee
0 2676 
0 2677    Cas. Ha, ha, how vildely doth this Cynicke rime?
0 2678   Bru. Get you hence sirra: Sawcy Fellow, hence
0 2679 
0 2680    Cas. Beare with him Brutus, 'tis his fashion
0 2681 
0 2682    Brut. Ile know his humor, when he knowes his time:
0 2683 What should the Warres do with these Iigging Fooles?
0 2684 Companion, hence
0 2685 
0 2686    Cas. Away, away be gone.
0 2687 
0 2688 Exit Poet
0 2689 
0 2690   Bru. Lucillius and Titinius bid the Commanders
0 2691 Prepare to lodge their Companies to night
0 2692 
0 2693    Cas. And come your selues, & bring Messala with you
0 2694 Immediately to vs
0 2695 
0 2696    Bru. Lucius, a bowle of Wine
0 2697 
0 2698    Cas. I did not thinke you could haue bin so angry
0 2699 
0 2700    Bru. O Cassius, I am sicke of many greefes
0 2701 
0 2702    Cas. Of your Philosophy you make no vse,
0 2703 If you giue place to accidentall euils
0 2704 
0 2705    Bru. No man beares sorrow better. Portia is dead
0 2706 
0 2707    Cas. Ha? Portia?
0 2708   Bru. She is dead
0 2709 
0 2710    Cas. How scap'd I killing, when I crost you so?
0 2711 O insupportable, and touching losse!
0 2712 Vpon what sicknesse?
0 2713   Bru. Impatient of my absence,
0 2714 And greefe, that yong Octauius with Mark Antony
0 2715 Haue made themselues so strong: For with her death
0 2716 That tydings came. With this she fell distract,
0 2717 And (her Attendants absent) swallow'd fire
0 2718 
0 2719    Cas. And dy'd so?
0 2720   Bru. Euen so
0 2721 
0 2722    Cas. O ye immortall Gods!
0 2723 Enter Boy with Wine, and Tapers.
0 2724 
0 2725   Bru. Speak no more of her: Giue me a bowl of wine,
0 2726 In this I bury all vnkindnesse Cassius.
0 2727 
0 2728 Drinkes
0 2729 
0 2730   Cas. My heart is thirsty for that Noble pledge.
0 2731 Fill Lucius, till the Wine ore-swell the Cup:
0 2732 I cannot drinke too much of Brutus loue.
0 2733 Enter Titinius and Messala.
0 2734 
0 2735   Brutus. Come in Titinius:
0 2736 Welcome good Messala:
0 2737 Now sit we close about this Taper heere,
0 2738 And call in question our necessities
0 2739 
0 2740    Cass. Portia, art thou gone?
0 2741   Bru. No more I pray you.
0 2742 Messala, I haue heere receiued Letters,
0 2743 That yong Octauius, and Marke Antony
0 2744 Come downe vpon vs with a mighty power,
0 2745 Bending their Expedition toward Philippi
0 2746 
0 2747    Mess. My selfe haue Letters of the selfe-same Tenure
0 2748 
0 2749    Bru. With what Addition
0 2750 
0 2751    Mess. That by proscription, and billes of Outlarie,
0 2752 Octauius, Antony, and Lepidus,
0 2753 Haue put to death, an hundred Senators
0 2754 
0 2755    Bru. Therein our Letters do not well agree:
0 2756 Mine speake of seuenty Senators, that dy'de
0 2757 By their proscriptions, Cicero being one
0 2758 
0 2759    Cassi. Cicero one?
0 2760   Messa. Cicero is dead, and by that order of proscription
0 2761 Had you your Letters from your wife, my Lord?
0 2762   Bru. No Messala
0 2763 
0 2764    Messa. Nor nothing in your Letters writ of her?
0 2765   Bru. Nothing Messala
0 2766 
0 2767    Messa. That me thinkes is strange
0 2768 
0 2769    Bru. Why aske you?
0 2770 Heare you ought of her, in yours?
0 2771   Messa. No my Lord
0 2772 
0 2773    Bru. Now as you are a Roman tell me true
0 2774 
0 2775    Messa. Then like a Roman, beare the truth I tell,
0 2776 For certaine she is dead, and by strange manner
0 2777 
0 2778    Bru. Why farewell Portia: We must die Messala:
0 2779 With meditating that she must dye once,
0 2780 I haue the patience to endure it now
0 2781 
0 2782    Messa. Euen so great men, great losses shold indure
0 2783 
0 2784    Cassi. I haue as much of this in Art as you,
0 2785 But yet my Nature could not beare it so
0 2786 
0 2787    Bru. Well, to our worke aliue. What do you thinke
0 2788 Of marching to Philippi presently
0 2789 
0 2790    Cassi. I do not thinke it good
0 2791 
0 2792    Bru. Your reason?
0 2793   Cassi. This it is:
0 2794 'Tis better that the Enemie seeke vs,
0 2795 So shall he waste his meanes, weary his Souldiers,
0 2796 Doing himselfe offence, whil'st we lying still,
0 2797 Are full of rest, defence, and nimblenesse
0 2798 
0 2799    Bru. Good reasons must of force giue place to better:
0 2800 The people 'twixt Philippi, and this ground
0 2801 Do stand but in a forc'd affection:
0 2802 For they haue grug'd vs Contribution.
0 2803 The Enemy, marching along by them,
0 2804 By them shall make a fuller number vp,
0 2805 Come on refresht, new added, and encourag'd:
0 2806 From which aduantage shall we cut him off.
0 2807 If at Philippi we do face him there,
0 2808 These people at our backe
0 2809 
0 2810    Cassi. Heare me good Brother
0 2811 
0 2812    Bru. Vnder your pardon. You must note beside,
0 2813 That we haue tride the vtmost of our Friends:
0 2814 Our Legions are brim full, our cause is ripe,
0 2815 The Enemy encreaseth euery day,
0 2816 We at the height, are readie to decline.
0 2817 There is a Tide in the affayres of men,
0 2818 Which taken at the Flood, leades on to Fortune:
0 2819 Omitted, all the voyage of their life,
0 2820 Is bound in Shallowes, and in Miseries.
0 2821 On such a full Sea are we now a-float,
0 2822 And we must take the current when it serues,
0 2823 Or loose our Ventures
0 2824 
0 2825    Cassi. Then with your will go on: wee'l along
0 2826 Our selues, and meet them at Philippi
0 2827 
0 2828    Bru. The deepe of night is crept vpon our talke,
0 2829 And Nature must obey Necessitie,
0 2830 Which we will niggard with a little rest:
0 2831 There is no more to say
0 2832 
0 2833    Cassi. No more, good night,
0 2834 Early to morrow will we rise, and hence.
0 2835 Enter Lucius.
0 2836 
0 2837   Bru. Lucius my Gowne: farewell good Messala,
0 2838 Good night Titinius: Noble, Noble Cassius,
0 2839 Good night, and good repose
0 2840 
0 2841    Cassi. O my deere Brother:
0 2842 This was an ill beginning of the night:
0 2843 Neuer come such diuision 'tweene our soules:
0 2844 Let it not Brutus.
0 2845 Enter Lucius with the Gowne.
0 2846 
0 2847   Bru. Euery thing is well
0 2848 
0 2849    Cassi. Good night my Lord
0 2850 
0 2851    Bru. Good night good Brother
0 2852 
0 2853    Tit. Messa. Good night Lord Brutus
0 2854 
0 2855    Bru. Farwell euery one.
0 2856 
0 2857 Exeunt.
0 2858 
0 2859 Giue me the Gowne. Where is thy Instrument?
0 2860   Luc. Heere in the Tent
0 2861 
0 2862    Bru. What, thou speak'st drowsily?
0 2863 Poore knaue I blame thee not, thou art ore-watch'd.
0 2864 Call Claudio, and some other of my men,
0 2865 Ile haue them sleepe on Cushions in my Tent
0 2866 
0 2867    Luc. Varrus, and Claudio.
0 2868 Enter Varrus and Claudio.
0 2869 
0 2870   Var. Cals my Lord?
0 2871   Bru. I pray you sirs, lye in my Tent and sleepe,
0 2872 It may be I shall raise you by and by
0 2873 On businesse to my Brother Cassius
0 2874 
0 2875    Var. So please you, we will stand,
0 2876 And watch your pleasure
0 2877 
0 2878    Bru. I will it not haue it so: Lye downe good sirs,
0 2879 It may be I shall otherwise bethinke me.
0 2880 Looke Lucius, heere's the booke I sought for so:
0 2881 I put it in the pocket of my Gowne
0 2882 
0 2883    Luc. I was sure your Lordship did not giue it me
0 2884 
0 2885    Bru. Beare with me good Boy, I am much forgetfull.
0 2886 Canst thou hold vp thy heauie eyes a-while,
0 2887 And touch thy Instrument a straine or two
0 2888 
0 2889    Luc. I my Lord, an't please you
0 2890 
0 2891    Bru. It does my Boy:
0 2892 I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing
0 2893 
0 2894    Luc. It is my duty Sir
0 2895 
0 2896    Brut. I should not vrge thy duty past thy might,
0 2897 I know yong bloods looke for a time of rest
0 2898 
0 2899    Luc. I haue slept my Lord already
0 2900 
0 2901    Bru. It was well done, and thou shalt sleepe againe:
0 2902 I will not hold thee long. If I do liue,
0 2903 I will be good to thee.
0 2904 
0 2905 Musicke, and a Song.
0 2906 
0 2907 This is a sleepy Tune: O Murd'rous slumber!
0 2908 Layest thou thy Leaden Mace vpon my Boy,
0 2909 That playes thee Musicke? Gentle knaue good night:
0 2910 I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
0 2911 If thou do'st nod, thou break'st thy Instrument,
0 2912 Ile take it from thee, and (good Boy) good night.
0 2913 Let me see, let me see; is not the Leafe turn'd downe
0 2914 Where I left reading? Heere it is I thinke.
0 2915 Enter the Ghost of Caesar.
0 2916 
0 2917 How ill this Taper burnes. Ha! Who comes heere?
0 2918 I thinke it is the weakenesse of mine eyes
0 2919 That shapes this monstrous Apparition.
0 2920 It comes vpon me: Art thou any thing?
0 2921 Art thou some God, some Angell, or some Diuell,
0 2922 That mak'st my blood cold, and my haire to stare?
0 2923 Speake to me, what thou art
0 2924 
0 2925    Ghost. Thy euill Spirit Brutus?
0 2926   Bru. Why com'st thou?
0 2927   Ghost. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi
0 2928 
0 2929    Brut. Well: then I shall see thee againe?
0 2930   Ghost. I, at Philippi
0 2931 
0 2932    Brut. Why I will see thee at Philippi then:
0 2933 Now I haue taken heart, thou vanishest.
0 2934 Ill Spirit, I would hold more talke with thee.
0 2935 Boy, Lucius, Varrus, Claudio, Sirs: Awake:
0 2936 Claudio
0 2937 
0 2938    Luc. The strings my Lord, are false
0 2939 
0 2940    Bru. He thinkes he still is at his Instrument.
0 2941 Lucius, awake
0 2942 
0 2943    Luc. My Lord
0 2944 
0 2945    Bru. Did'st thou dreame Lucius, that thou so cryedst
0 2946 out?
0 2947   Luc. My Lord, I do not know that I did cry
0 2948 
0 2949    Bru. Yes that thou did'st: Did'st thou see any thing?
0 2950   Luc. Nothing my Lord
0 2951 
0 2952    Bru. Sleepe againe Lucius: Sirra Claudio, Fellow,
0 2953 Thou: Awake
0 2954 
0 2955    Var. My Lord
0 2956 
0 2957    Clau. My Lord
0 2958 
0 2959    Bru. Why did you so cry out sirs, in your sleepe?
0 2960   Both. Did we my Lord?
0 2961   Bru. I: saw you any thing?
0 2962   Var. No my Lord, I saw nothing
0 2963 
0 2964    Clau. Nor I my Lord
0 2965 
0 2966    Bru. Go, and commend me to my Brother Cassius:
0 2967 Bid him set on his Powres betimes before,
0 2968 And we will follow
0 2969 
0 2970    Both. It shall be done my Lord.
0 2971 
0 2972 Exeunt.
0 2973 
0 2974 Actus Quintus.
0 2975 
0 2976 Enter Octauius, Antony, and their Army.
0 2977 
0 2978   Octa. Now Antony, our hopes are answered,
0 2979 You said the Enemy would not come downe,
0 2980 But keepe the Hilles and vpper Regions:
0 2981 It proues not so: their battailes are at hand,
0 2982 They meane to warne vs at Philippi heere:
0 2983 Answering before we do demand of them
0 2984 
0 2985    Ant. Tut I am in their bosomes, and I know
0 2986 Wherefore they do it: They could be content
0 2987 To visit other places, and come downe
0 2988 With fearefull brauery: thinking by this face
0 2989 To fasten in our thoughts that they haue Courage;
0 2990 But 'tis not so.
0 2991 Enter a Messenger.
0 2992 
0 2993   Mes. Prepare you Generals,
0 2994 The Enemy comes on in gallant shew:
0 2995 Their bloody signe of Battell is hung out,
0 2996 And something to be done immediately
0 2997 
0 2998    Ant. Octauius, leade your Battaile softly on
0 2999 Vpon the left hand of the euen Field
0 3000 
0 3001    Octa. Vpon the right hand I, keepe thou the left
0 3002 
0 3003    Ant. Why do you crosse me in this exigent
0 3004 
0 3005    Octa. I do not crosse you: but I will do so.
0 3006 
0 3007 March.
0 3008 
0 3009 Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, & their Army.
0 3010 
0 3011   Bru. They stand, and would haue parley
0 3012 
0 3013    Cassi. Stand fast Titinius, we must out and talke
0 3014 
0 3015    Octa. Mark Antony, shall we giue signe of Battaile?
0 3016   Ant. No Caesar, we will answer on their Charge.
0 3017 Make forth, the Generals would haue some words
0 3018 
0 3019    Oct. Stirre not vntill the Signall
0 3020 
0 3021    Bru. Words before blowes: is it so Countrymen?
0 3022   Octa. Not that we loue words better, as you do
0 3023 
0 3024    Bru. Good words are better then bad strokes Octauius
0 3025 
0 3026    An. In your bad strokes Brutus, you giue good words
0 3027 Witnesse the hole you made in Caesars heart,
0 3028 Crying long liue, Haile Caesar
0 3029 
0 3030    Cassi. Antony,
0 3031 The posture of your blowes are yet vnknowne;
0 3032 But for your words, they rob the Hibla Bees,
0 3033 And leaue them Hony-lesse
0 3034 
0 3035    Ant. Not stinglesse too
0 3036 
0 3037    Bru. O yes, and soundlesse too:
0 3038 For you haue stolne their buzzing Antony,
0 3039 And very wisely threat before you sting
0 3040 
0 3041    Ant. Villains: you did not so, when your vile daggers
0 3042 Hackt one another in the sides of Caesar:
0 3043 You shew'd your teethes like Apes,
0 3044 And fawn'd like Hounds,
0 3045 And bow'd like Bondmen, kissing Caesars feete;
0 3046 Whil'st damned Caska, like a Curre, behinde
0 3047 Strooke Caesar on the necke. O you Flatterers
0 3048 
0 3049    Cassi. Flatterers? Now Brutus thanke your selfe,
0 3050 This tongue had not offended so to day.
0 3051 If Cassius might haue rul'd
0 3052 
0 3053    Octa. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make vs swet,
0 3054 The proofe of it will turne to redder drops:
0 3055 Looke, I draw a Sword against Conspirators,
0 3056 When thinke you that the Sword goes vp againe?
0 3057 Neuer till Caesars three and thirtie wounds
0 3058 Be well aueng'd; or till another Caesar
0 3059 Haue added slaughter to the Sword of Traitors
0 3060 
0 3061    Brut. Caesar, thou canst not dye by Traitors hands.
0 3062 Vnlesse thou bring'st them with thee
0 3063 
0 3064    Octa. So I hope:
0 3065 I was not borne to dye on Brutus Sword
0 3066 
0 3067    Bru. O if thou wer't the Noblest of thy Straine,
0 3068 Yong-man, thou could'st not dye more honourable
0 3069 
0 3070    Cassi. A peeuish School-boy, worthles of such Honor
0 3071 Ioyn'd with a Masker, and a Reueller
0 3072 
0 3073    Ant. Old Cassius still
0 3074 
0 3075    Octa. Come Antony: away:
0 3076 Defiance Traitors, hurle we in your teeth.
0 3077 If you dare fight to day, come to the Field;
0 3078 If not, when you haue stomackes.
0 3079 
0 3080 Exit Octauius, Antony, and Army
0 3081 
0 3082   Cassi. Why now blow winde, swell Billow,
0 3083 And swimme Barke:
0 3084 The Storme is vp, and all is on the hazard
0 3085 
0 3086    Bru. Ho Lucillius, hearke, a word with you.
0 3087 
0 3088 Lucillius and Messala stand forth.
0 3089 
0 3090   Luc. My Lord
0 3091 
0 3092    Cassi. Messala
0 3093 
0 3094    Messa. What sayes my Generall?
0 3095   Cassi. Messala, this is my Birth-day: at this very day
0 3096 Was Cassius borne. Giue me thy hand Messala:
0 3097 Be thou my witnesse, that against my will
0 3098 (As Pompey was) am I compell'd to set
0 3099 Vpon one Battell all our Liberties.
0 3100 You know, that I held Epicurus strong,
0 3101 And his Opinion: Now I change my minde,
0 3102 And partly credit things that do presage.
0 3103 Comming from Sardis, on our former Ensigne
0 3104 Two mighty Eagles fell, and there they pearch'd,
0 3105 Gorging and feeding from our Soldiers hands,
0 3106 Who to Philippi heere consorted vs:
0 3107 This Morning are they fled away, and gone,
0 3108 And in their steeds, do Rauens, Crowes, and Kites
0 3109 Fly ore our heads, and downward looke on vs
0 3110 As we were sickely prey; their shadowes seeme
0 3111 A Canopy most fatall, vnder which
0 3112 Our Army lies, ready to giue vp the Ghost
0 3113 
0 3114    Messa. Beleeue not so
0 3115 
0 3116    Cassi. I but beleeue it partly,
0 3117 For I am fresh of spirit, and resolu'd
0 3118 To meete all perils, very constantly
0 3119 
0 3120    Bru. Euen so Lucillius
0 3121 
0 3122    Cassi. Now most Noble Brutus,
0 3123 The Gods to day stand friendly, that we may
0 3124 Louers in peace, leade on our dayes to age.
0 3125 But since the affayres of men rests still incertaine,
0 3126 Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
0 3127 If we do lose this Battaile, then is this
0 3128 The very last time we shall speake together:
0 3129 What are you then determined to do?
0 3130   Bru. Euen by the rule of that Philosophy,
0 3131 By which I did blame Cato, for the death
0 3132 Which he did giue himselfe, I know not how:
0 3133 But I do finde it Cowardly, and vile,
0 3134 For feare of what might fall, so to preuent
0 3135 The time of life, arming my selfe with patience,
0 3136 To stay the prouidence of some high Powers,
0 3137 That gouerne vs below
0 3138 
0 3139    Cassi. Then, if we loose this Battaile,
0 3140 You are contented to be led in Triumph
0 3141 Thorow the streets of Rome
0 3142 
0 3143    Bru. No Cassius, no:
0 3144 Thinke not thou Noble Romane,
0 3145 That euer Brutus will go bound to Rome,
0 3146 He beares too great a minde. But this same day
0 3147 Must end that worke, the Ides of March begun.
0 3148 And whether we shall meete againe, I know not:
0 3149 Therefore our euerlasting farewell take:
0 3150 For euer, and for euer, farewell Cassius,
0 3151 If we do meete againe, why we shall smile;
0 3152 If not, why then this parting was well made
0 3153 
0 3154    Cassi. For euer, and for euer, farewell Brutus:
0 3155 If we do meete againe, wee'l smile indeede;
0 3156 If not, 'tis true, this parting was well made
0 3157 
0 3158    Bru. Why then leade on. O that a man might know
0 3159 The end of this dayes businesse, ere it come:
0 3160 But it sufficeth, that the day will end,
0 3161 And then the end is knowne. Come ho, away.
0 3162 
0 3163 Exeunt.
0 3164 
0 3165 Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.
0 3166 
0 3167   Bru. Ride, ride Messala, ride and giue these Billes
0 3168 Vnto the Legions, on the other side.
0 3169 
0 3170 Lowd Alarum.
0 3171 
0 3172 Let them set on at once: for I perceiue
0 3173 But cold demeanor in Octauio's wing:
0 3174 And sodaine push giues them the ouerthrow:
0 3175 Ride, ride Messala, let them all come downe.
0 3176 
0 3177 Exeunt.
0 3178 
0 3179 Alarums. Enter Cassius and Titinius.
0 3180 
0 3181   Cassi. O looke Titinius, looke, the Villaines flye:
0 3182 My selfe haue to mine owne turn'd Enemy:
0 3183 This Ensigne heere of mine was turning backe,
0 3184 I slew the Coward, and did take it from him
0 3185 
0 3186    Titin. O Cassius, Brutus gaue the word too early,
0 3187 Who hauing some aduantage on Octauius,
0 3188 Tooke it too eagerly: his Soldiers fell to spoyle,
0 3189 Whilst we by Antony are all inclos'd.
0 3190 Enter Pindarus.
0 3191 
0 3192   Pind. Fly further off my Lord: flye further off,
0 3193 Mark Antony is in your Tents my Lord:
0 3194 Flye therefore Noble Cassius, flye farre off
0 3195 
0 3196    Cassi. This Hill is farre enough. Looke, look Titinius
0 3197 Are those my Tents where I perceiue the fire?
0 3198   Tit. They are, my Lord
0 3199 
0 3200    Cassi. Titinius, if thou louest me,
0 3201 Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurres in him,
0 3202 Till he haue brought thee vp to yonder Troopes
0 3203 And heere againe, that I may rest assur'd
0 3204 Whether yond Troopes, are Friend or Enemy
0 3205 
0 3206    Tit. I will be heere againe, euen with a thought.
0 3207 Enter.
0 3208 
0 3209   Cassi. Go Pindarus, get higher on that hill,
0 3210 My sight was euer thicke: regard Titinius,
0 3211 And tell me what thou not'st about the Field.
0 3212 This day I breathed first, Time is come round,
0 3213 And where I did begin, there shall I end,
0 3214 My life is run his compasse. Sirra, what newes?
0 3215   Pind. Aboue. O my Lord
0 3216 
0 3217    Cassi. What newes?
0 3218   Pind. Titinius is enclosed round about
0 3219 With Horsemen, that make to him on the Spurre,
0 3220 Yet he spurres on. Now they are almost on him:
0 3221 Now Titinius. Now some light: O he lights too.
0 3222 Hee's tane.
0 3223 
0 3224 Showt.
0 3225 
0 3226 And hearke, they shout for ioy
0 3227 
0 3228    Cassi. Come downe, behold no more:
0 3229 O Coward that I am, to liue so long,
0 3230 To see my best Friend tane before my face
0 3231 Enter Pindarus.
0 3232 
0 3233 Come hither sirrah: In Parthia did I take thee Prisoner,
0 3234 And then I swore thee, sauing of thy life,
0 3235 That whatsoeuer I did bid thee do,
0 3236 Thou should'st attempt it. Come now, keepe thine oath,
0 3237 Now be a Free-man, and with this good Sword
0 3238 That ran through Caesars bowels, search this bosome.
0 3239 Stand not to answer: Heere, take thou the Hilts,
0 3240 And when my face is couer'd, as 'tis now,
0 3241 Guide thou the Sword- Caesar, thou art reueng'd,
0 3242 Euen with the Sword that kill'd thee
0 3243 
0 3244    Pin. So, I am free,
0 3245 Yet would not so haue beene
0 3246 Durst I haue done my will. O Cassius,
0 3247 Farre from this Country Pindarus shall run,
0 3248 Where neuer Roman shall take note of him.
0 3249 Enter Titinius and Messala.
0 3250 
0 3251   Messa. It is but change, Titinius: for Octauius
0 3252 Is ouerthrowne by Noble Brutus power,
0 3253 As Cassius Legions are by Antony
0 3254 
0 3255    Titin. These tydings will well comfort Cassius
0 3256 
0 3257    Messa. Where did you leaue him
0 3258 
0 3259    Titin. All disconsolate,
0 3260 With Pindarus his Bondman, on this Hill
0 3261 
0 3262    Messa. Is not that he that lyes vpon the ground?
0 3263   Titin. He lies not like the Liuing. O my heart!
0 3264   Messa. Is not that hee?
0 3265   Titin. No, this was he Messala,
0 3266 But Cassius is no more. O setting Sunne:
0 3267 As in thy red Rayes thou doest sinke to night;
0 3268 So in his red blood Cassius day is set.
0 3269 The Sunne of Rome is set. Our day is gone,
0 3270 Clowds, Dewes, and Dangers come; our deeds are done:
0 3271 Mistrust of my successe hath done this deed
0 3272 
0 3273    Messa. Mistrust of good successe hath done this deed.
0 3274 O hatefull Error, Melancholies Childe:
0 3275 Why do'st thou shew to the apt thoughts of men
0 3276 The things that are not? O Error soone conceyu'd,
0 3277 Thou neuer com'st vnto a happy byrth,
0 3278 But kil'st the Mother that engendred thee
0 3279 
0 3280    Tit. What Pindarus? Where art thou Pindarus?
0 3281   Messa. Seeke him Titinius, whilst I go to meet
0 3282 The Noble Brutus, thrusting this report
0 3283 Into his eares; I may say thrusting it:
0 3284 For piercing Steele, and Darts inuenomed,
0 3285 Shall be as welcome to the eares of Brutus,
0 3286 As tydings of this sight
0 3287 
0 3288    Tit. Hye you Messala,
0 3289 And I will seeke for Pindarus the while:
0 3290 Why did'st thou send me forth braue Cassius?
0 3291 Did I not meet thy Friends, and did not they
0 3292 Put on my Browes this wreath of Victorie,
0 3293 And bid me giue it thee? Did'st thou not heare their showts?
0 3294 Alas, thou hast misconstrued euery thing.
0 3295 But hold thee, take this Garland on thy Brow,
0 3296 Thy Brutus bid me giue it thee, and I
0 3297 Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
0 3298 And see how I regarded Caius Cassius:
0 3299 By your leaue Gods: This is a Romans part,
0 3300 Come Cassius Sword, and finde Titinius hart.
0 3301 
0 3302 Dies
0 3303 
0 3304 Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, yong Cato, Strato, Volumnius, and
0 3305 Lucillius.
0 3306 
0 3307   Bru. Where, where Messala, doth his body lye?
0 3308   Messa. Loe yonder, and Titinius mourning it
0 3309 
0 3310    Bru. Titinius face is vpward
0 3311 
0 3312    Cato. He is slaine
0 3313 
0 3314    Bru. O Iulius Caesar, thou art mighty yet,
0 3315 Thy Spirit walkes abroad, and turnes our Swords
0 3316 In our owne proper Entrailes. Low Alarums
0 3317 
0 3318    Cato. Braue Titinius,
0 3319 Looke where he haue not crown'd dead Cassius
0 3320 
0 3321    Bru. Are yet two Romans liuing such as these?
0 3322 The last of all the Romans, far thee well:
0 3323 It is impossible, that euer Rome
0 3324 Should breed thy fellow. Friends I owe mo teares
0 3325 To this dead man, then you shall see me pay.
0 3326 I shall finde time, Cassius: I shall finde time.
0 3327 Come therefore, and to Tharsus send his body,
0 3328 His Funerals shall not be in our Campe,
0 3329 Least it discomfort vs. Lucillius come,
0 3330 And come yong Cato, let vs to the Field,
0 3331 Labio and Flauio set our Battailes on:
0 3332 'Tis three a clocke, and Romans yet ere night,
0 3333 We shall try Fortune in a second fight.
0 3334 
0 3335 Exeunt.
0 3336 
0 3337 Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, Cato, Lucillius, and Flauius.
0 3338 
0 3339   Bru. Yet Country-men: O yet, hold vp your heads
0 3340 
0 3341    Cato. What Bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
0 3342 I will proclaime my name about the Field.
0 3343 I am the Sonne of Marcus Cato, hoe.
0 3344 A Foe to Tyrants, and my Countries Friend.
0 3345 I am the Sonne of Marcus Cato, hoe.
0 3346 Enter Souldiers, and fight.
0 3347 
0 3348 And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I,
0 3349 Brutus my Countries Friend: Know me for Brutus
0 3350 
0 3351    Luc. O yong and Noble Cato, art thou downe?
0 3352 Why now thou dyest, as brauely as Titinius,
0 3353 And may'st be honour'd, being Cato's Sonne
0 3354 
0 3355    Sold. Yeeld, or thou dyest
0 3356 
0 3357    Luc. Onely I yeeld to dye:
0 3358 There is so much, that thou wilt kill me straight:
0 3359 Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death
0 3360 
0 3361    Sold. We must not: a Noble Prisoner.
0 3362 Enter Antony.
0 3363 
0 3364   2.Sold. Roome hoe: tell Antony, Brutus is tane
0 3365 
0 3366    1.Sold. Ile tell thee newes. Heere comes the Generall,
0 3367 Brutus is tane, Brutus is tane my Lord
0 3368 
0 3369    Ant. Where is hee?
0 3370   Luc. Safe Antony, Brutus is safe enough:
0 3371 I dare assure thee, that no Enemy
0 3372 Shall euer take aliue the Noble Brutus:
0 3373 The Gods defend him from so great a shame,
0 3374 When you do finde him, or aliue, or dead,
0 3375 He will be found like Brutus, like himselfe
0 3376 
0 3377    Ant. This is not Brutus friend, but I assure you,
0 3378 A prize no lesse in worth; keepe this man safe,
0 3379 Giue him all kindnesse. I had rather haue
0 3380 Such men my Friends, then Enemies. Go on,
0 3381 And see where Brutus be aliue or dead,
0 3382 And bring vs word, vnto Octauius Tent:
0 3383 How euery thing is chanc'd.
0 3384 
0 3385 Exeunt.
0 3386 
0 3387 Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.
0 3388 
0 3389   Brut. Come poore remaines of friends, rest on this
0 3390 Rocke
0 3391 
0 3392    Clit. Statillius shew'd the Torch-light, but my Lord
0 3393 He came not backe: he is or tane, or slaine
0 3394 
0 3395    Brut. Sit thee downe, Clitus: slaying is the word,
0 3396 It is a deed in fashion. Hearke thee, Clitus
0 3397 
0 3398    Clit. What I, my Lord? No, not for all the World
0 3399 
0 3400    Brut. Peace then, no words
0 3401 
0 3402    Clit. Ile rather kill my selfe
0 3403 
0 3404    Brut. Hearke thee, Dardanius
0 3405 
0 3406    Dard. Shall I doe such a deed?
0 3407   Clit. O Dardanius
0 3408 
0 3409    Dard. O Clitus
0 3410 
0 3411    Clit. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
0 3412   Dard. To kill him, Clitus: looke he meditates
0 3413 
0 3414    Clit. Now is that Noble Vessell full of griefe,
0 3415 That it runnes ouer euen at his eyes
0 3416 
0 3417    Brut. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word
0 3418 
0 3419    Volum. What sayes my Lord?
0 3420   Brut. Why this, Volumnius:
0 3421 The Ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
0 3422 Two seuerall times by Night: at Sardis, once;
0 3423 And this last Night, here in Philippi fields:
0 3424 I know my houre is come
0 3425 
0 3426    Volum. Not so, my Lord
0 3427 
0 3428    Brut. Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
0 3429 Thou seest the World, Volumnius, how it goes,
0 3430 Our Enemies haue beat vs to the Pit:
0 3431 
0 3432 Low Alarums.
0 3433 
0 3434 It is more worthy, to leape in our selues,
0 3435 Then tarry till they push vs. Good Volumnius,
0 3436 Thou know'st, that we two went to Schoole together:
0 3437 Euen for that our loue of old, I prethee
0 3438 Hold thou my Sword Hilts, whilest I runne on it
0 3439 
0 3440    Vol. That's not an Office for a friend, my Lord.
0 3441 
0 3442 Alarum still.
0 3443 
0 3444   Cly. Fly, flye my Lord, there is no tarrying heere
0 3445 
0 3446    Bru. Farewell to you, and you, and Volumnius.
0 3447 Strato, thou hast bin all this while asleepe:
0 3448 Farewell to thee, to Strato, Countrymen:
0 3449 My heart doth ioy, that yet in all my life,
0 3450 I found no man, but he was true to me.
0 3451 I shall haue glory by this loosing day
0 3452 More then Octauius, and Marke Antony,
0 3453 By this vile Conquest shall attaine vnto.
0 3454 So fare you well at once, for Brutus tongue
0 3455 Hath almost ended his liues History:
0 3456 Night hangs vpon mine eyes, my Bones would rest,
0 3457 That haue but labour'd, to attaine this houre.
0 3458 
0 3459 Alarum. Cry within, Flye, flye, flye.
0 3460 
0 3461   Cly. Fly my Lord, flye
0 3462 
0 3463    Bru. Hence: I will follow:
0 3464 I prythee Strato, stay thou by thy Lord,
0 3465 Thou art a Fellow of a good respect:
0 3466 Thy life hath had some smatch of Honor in it,
0 3467 Hold then my Sword, and turne away thy face,
0 3468 While I do run vpon it. Wilt thou Strato?
0 3469   Stra. Giue me your hand first. Fare you wel my Lord
0 3470 
0 3471    Bru. Farewell good Strato. - Caesar, now be still,
0 3472 I kill'd not thee with halfe so good a will.
0 3473 Dyes.
0 3474 
0 3475 Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octauius, Messala, Lucillius, and
0 3476 the
0 3477 Army.
0 3478 
0 3479   Octa. What man is that?
0 3480   Messa. My Masters man. Strato, where is thy Master?
0 3481   Stra. Free from the Bondage you are in Messala,
0 3482 The Conquerors can but make a fire of him:
0 3483 For Brutus onely ouercame himselfe,
0 3484 And no man else hath Honor by his death
0 3485 
0 3486    Lucil. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee Brutus
0 3487 That thou hast prou'd Lucillius saying true,
0 3488   Octa. All that seru'd Brutus, I will entertaine them.
0 3489 Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
0 3490   Stra. I, if Messala will preferre me to you
0 3491 
0 3492    Octa. Do so, good Messala
0 3493 
0 3494    Messa. How dyed my Master Strato?
0 3495   Stra. I held the Sword, and he did run on it
0 3496 
0 3497    Messa. Octauius, then take him to follow thee,
0 3498 That did the latest seruice to my Master
0 3499 
0 3500    Ant. This was the Noblest Roman of them all:
0 3501 All the Conspirators saue onely hee,
0 3502 Did that they did, in enuy of great Caesar:
0 3503 He, onely in a generall honest thought,
0 3504 And common good to all, made one of them.
0 3505 His life was gentle, and the Elements
0 3506 So mixt in him, that Nature might stand vp,
0 3507 And say to all the world; This was a man
0 3508 
0 3509    Octa. According to his Vertue, let vs vse him
0 3510 Withall Respect, and Rites of Buriall.
0 3511 Within my Tent his bones to night shall ly,
0 3512 Most like a Souldier ordered Honourably:
0 3513 So call the Field to rest, and let's away,
0 3514 To part the glories of this happy day.
0 3515 
0 3516 Exeunt. omnes.
