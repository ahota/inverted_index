10 1 
10 2 Actus primus.
10 3 
10 4 Enter Anthonio, Salarino, and Salanio.
10 5 
10 6   Anthonio. In sooth I know not why I am so sad,
10 7 It wearies me: you say it wearies you;
10 8 But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
10 9 What stuffe 'tis made of, whereof it is borne,
10 10 I am to learne: and such a Want-wit sadnesse makes of
10 11 mee,
10 12 That I haue much ado to know my selfe
10 13 
10 14    Sal. Your minde is tossing on the Ocean,
10 15 There where your Argosies with portly saile
10 16 Like Signiors and rich Burgers on the flood,
10 17 Or as it were the Pageants of the sea,
10 18 Do ouer-peere the pettie Traffiquers
10 19 That curtsie to them, do them reuerence
10 20 As they flye by them with their wouen wings
10 21 
10 22    Salar. Beleeue me sir, had I such venture forth,
10 23 The better part of my affections, would
10 24 Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
10 25 Plucking the grasse to know where sits the winde,
10 26 Peering in Maps for ports, and peers, and rodes:
10 27 And euery obiect that might make me feare
10 28 Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
10 29 Would make me sad
10 30 
10 31    Sal. My winde cooling my broth,
10 32 Would blow me to an Ague, when I thought
10 33 What harme a winde too great might doe at sea.
10 34 I should not see the sandie houre-glasse runne,
10 35 But I should thinke of shallows, and of flats,
10 36 And see my wealthy Andrew docks in sand,
10 37 Vailing her high top lower then her ribs
10 38 To kisse her buriall; should I goe to Church
10 39 And see the holy edifice of stone,
10 40 And not bethinke me straight of dangerous rocks,
10 41 Which touching but my gentle Vessels side
10 42 Would scatter all her spices on the streame,
10 43 Enrobe the roring waters with my silkes,
10 44 And in a word, but euen now worth this,
10 45 And now worth nothing. Shall I haue the thought
10 46 To thinke on this, and shall I lacke the thought
10 47 That such a thing bechaunc'd would make me sad?
10 48 But tell me, I know Anthonio
10 49 Is sad to thinke vpon his merchandize
10 50 
10 51    Anth. Beleeue me no, I thanke my fortune for it,
10 52 My ventures are not in one bottome trusted,
10 53 Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
10 54 Vpon the fortune of this present yeere:
10 55 Therefore my merchandize makes me not sad
10 56 
10 57    Sola. Why then you are in loue
10 58 
10 59    Anth. Fie, fie
10 60 
10 61    Sola. Not in loue neither: then let vs say you are sad
10 62 Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easie
10 63 For you to laugh and leape, and say you are merry
10 64 Because you are not sad. Now by two-headed Ianus,
10 65 Nature hath fram'd strange fellowes in her time:
10 66 Some that will euermore peepe through their eyes,
10 67 And laugh like Parrats at a bag-piper.
10 68 And other of such vineger aspect,
10 69 That they'll not shew their teeth in way of smile,
10 70 Though Nestor sweare the iest be laughable.
10 71 Enter Bassanio, Lorenso, and Gratiano.
10 72 
10 73   Sola. Heere comes Bassanio,
10 74 Your most noble Kinsman,
10 75 Gratiano, and Lorenso. Faryewell,
10 76 We leaue you now with better company
10 77 
10 78    Sala. I would haue staid till I had made you merry,
10 79 If worthier friends had not preuented me
10 80 
10 81    Ant. Your worth is very deere in my regard.
10 82 I take it your owne busines calls on you,
10 83 And you embrace th' occasion to depart
10 84 
10 85    Sal. Good morrow my good Lords
10 86 
10 87    Bass. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
10 88 You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
10 89   Sal. Wee'll make our leysures to attend on yours.
10 90 
10 91 Exeunt. Salarino, and Solanio.
10 92 
10 93   Lor. My Lord Bassanio, since you haue found Anthonio
10 94 We two will leaue you, but at dinner time
10 95 I pray you haue in minde where we must meete
10 96 
10 97    Bass. I will not faile you
10 98 
10 99    Grat. You looke not well signior Anthonio,
10 100 You haue too much respect vpon the world:
10 101 They loose it that doe buy it with much care,
10 102 Beleeue me you are maruellously chang'd
10 103 
10 104    Ant. I hold the world but as the world Gratiano,
10 105 A stage, where euery man must play a part,
10 106 And mine a sad one
10 107 
10 108    Grati. Let me play the foole,
10 109 With mirth and laughter let old wrinckles come,
10 110 And let my Liuer rather heate with wine,
10 111 Then my heart coole with mortifying grones.
10 112 Why should a man whose bloud is warme within,
10 113 Sit like his Grandsire, cut in Alablaster?
10 114 Sleepe when he wakes? and creep into the Iaundies
10 115 By being peeuish? I tell thee what Anthonio,
10 116 I loue thee, and it is my loue that speakes:
10 117 There are a sort of men, whose visages
10 118 Do creame and mantle like a standing pond,
10 119 And do a wilfull stilnesse entertaine,
10 120 With purpose to be drest in an opinion
10 121 Of wisedome, grauity, profound conceit,
10 122 As who should say, I am sir an Oracle,
10 123 And when I ope my lips, let no dogge barke.
10 124 O my Anthonio, I do know of these
10 125 That therefore onely are reputed wise,
10 126 For saying nothing; when I am verie sure
10 127 If they should speake, would almost dam those eares
10 128 Which hearing them would call their brothers fooles:
10 129 Ile tell thee more of this another time.
10 130 But fish not with this melancholly baite
10 131 For this foole Gudgin, this opinion:
10 132 Come good Lorenzo, faryewell a while,
10 133 Ile end my exhortation after dinner
10 134 
10 135    Lor. Well, we will leaue you then till dinner time.
10 136 I must be one of these same dumbe wise men.
10 137 For Gratiano neuer let's me speake
10 138 
10 139    Gra. Well, keepe me company but two yeares mo,
10 140 Thou shalt not know the sound of thine owne tongue
10 141 
10 142    Ant. Far you well, Ile grow a talker for this geare
10 143 
10 144    Gra. Thankes ifaith, for silence is onely commendable
10 145 In a neats tongue dri'd, and a maid not vendible.
10 146 Enter.
10 147 
10 148   Ant. It is that any thing now
10 149 
10 150    Bas. Gratiano speakes an infinite deale of nothing,
10 151 more then any man in all Venice, his reasons are two
10 152 graines of wheate hid in two bushels of chaffe: you shall
10 153 seeke all day ere you finde them, & when you haue them
10 154 they are not worth the search
10 155 
10 156    An. Well: tel me now, what Lady is the same
10 157 To whom you swore a secret Pilgrimage
10 158 That you to day promis'd to tel me of?
10 159   Bas. Tis not vnknowne to you Anthonio
10 160 How much I haue disabled mine estate,
10 161 By something shewing a more swelling port
10 162 Then my faint meanes would grant continuance:
10 163 Nor do I now make mone to be abridg'd
10 164 From such a noble rate, but my cheefe care
10 165 Is to come fairely off from the great debts
10 166 Wherein my time something too prodigall
10 167 Hath left me gag'd: to you Anthonio
10 168 I owe the most in money, and in loue,
10 169 And from your loue I haue a warrantie
10 170 To vnburthen all my plots and purposes,
10 171 How to get cleere of all the debts I owe
10 172 
10 173    An. I pray you good Bassanio let me know it,
10 174 And if it stand as you your selfe still do,
10 175 Within the eye of honour, be assur'd
10 176 My purse, my person, my extreamest meanes
10 177 Lye all vnlock'd to your occasions
10 178 
10 179    Bass. In my schoole dayes, when I had lost one shaft
10 180 I shot his fellow of the selfesame flight
10 181 The selfesame way, with more aduised watch
10 182 To finde the other forth, and by aduenturing both,
10 183 I oft found both. I vrge this child-hoode proofe,
10 184 Because what followes is pure innocence.
10 185 I owe you much, and like a wilfull youth,
10 186 That which I owe is lost: but if you please
10 187 To shoote another arrow that selfe way
10 188 Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
10 189 As I will watch the ayme: Or to finde both,
10 190 Or bring your latter hazard backe againe,
10 191 And thankfully rest debter for the first
10 192 
10 193    An. You know me well, and herein spend but time
10 194 To winde about my loue with circumstance,
10 195 And out of doubt you doe more wrong
10 196 In making question of my vttermost
10 197 Then if you had made waste of all I haue:
10 198 Then doe but say to me what I should doe
10 199 That in your knowledge may by me be done,
10 200 And I am prest vnto it: therefore speake
10 201 
10 202    Bass. In Belmont is a Lady richly left,
10 203 And she is faire, and fairer then that word,
10 204 Of wondrous vertues, sometimes from her eyes
10 205 I did receiue faire speechlesse messages:
10 206 Her name is Portia, nothing vndervallewd
10 207 To Cato's daughter, Brutus Portia,
10 208 Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
10 209 For the four windes blow in from euery coast
10 210 Renowned sutors, and her sunny locks
10 211 Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
10 212 Which makes her seat of Belmont Cholchos strond,
10 213 And many Iasons come in quest of her.
10 214 O my Anthonio, had I but the meanes
10 215 To hold a riuall place with one of them,
10 216 I haue a minde presages me such thrift,
10 217 That I should questionlesse be fortunate
10 218 
10 219    Anth. Thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea,
10 220 Neither haue I money, nor commodity
10 221 To raise a present summe, therefore goe forth
10 222 Try what my credit can in Venice doe,
10 223 That shall be rackt euen to the vttermost,
10 224 To furnish thee to Belmont to faire Portia.
10 225 Goe presently enquire, and so will I
10 226 Where money is, and I no question make
10 227 To haue it of my trust, or for my sake.
10 228 
10 229 Exeunt.
10 230 
10 231 Enter Portia with her waiting woman Nerissa.
10 232 
10 233   Portia. By my troth Nerrissa, my little body is a wearie
10 234 of this great world
10 235 
10 236    Ner. You would be sweet Madam, if your miseries
10 237 were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are:
10 238 and yet for ought I see, they are as sicke that surfet with
10 239 too much, as they that starue with nothing; it is no smal
10 240 happinesse therefore to bee seated in the meane, superfluitie
10 241 comes sooner by white haires, but competencie
10 242 liues longer
10 243 
10 244    Portia. Good sentences, and well pronounc'd
10 245 
10 246    Ner. They would be better if well followed
10 247 
10 248    Portia. If to doe were as easie as to know what were
10 249 good to doe, Chappels had beene Churches, and poore
10 250 mens cottages Princes Pallaces: it is a good Diuine that
10 251 followes his owne instructions; I can easier teach twentie
10 252 what were good to be done, then be one of the twentie
10 253 to follow mine owne teaching: the braine may deuise
10 254 lawes for the blood, but a hot temper leapes ore a
10 255 colde decree, such a hare is madnesse the youth, to skip
10 256 ore the meshes of good counsaile the cripple; but this
10 257 reason is not in fashion to choose me a husband: O mee,
10 258 the word choose, I may neither choose whom I would,
10 259 nor refuse whom I dislike, so is the wil of a liuing daughter
10 260 curb'd by the will of a dead father: it is not hard Nerrissa,
10 261 that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none
10 262 
10 263    Ner. Your father was euer vertuous, and holy men
10 264 at their death haue good inspirations, therefore the lotterie
10 265 that hee hath deuised in these three chests of gold,
10 266 siluer, and leade, whereof who chooses his meaning,
10 267 chooses you, wil no doubt neuer be chosen by any rightly,
10 268 but one who you shall rightly loue: but what warmth
10 269 is there in your affection towards any of these Princely
10 270 suters that are already come?
10 271   Por. I pray thee ouer-name them, and as thou namest
10 272 them, I will describe them, and according to my description
10 273 leuell at my affection
10 274 
10 275    Ner. First there is the Neopolitane Prince
10 276 
10 277    Por. I that's a colt indeede, for he doth nothing but
10 278 talke of his horse, and hee makes it a great appropriation
10 279 to his owne good parts that he can shoo him himselfe:
10 280 I am much afraid my Ladie his mother plaid false
10 281 with a Smyth
10 282 
10 283    Ner. Than is there the Countie Palentine
10 284 
10 285    Por. He doth nothing but frowne (as who should
10 286 say, and you will not haue me, choose: he heares merrie
10 287 tales and smiles not, I feare hee will proue the weeping
10 288 Phylosopher when he growes old, being so full of vnmannerly
10 289 sadnesse in his youth.) I had rather to be married
10 290 to a deaths head with a bone in his mouth, then to either
10 291 of these: God defend me from these two
10 292 
10 293    Ner. How say you by the French Lord, Mounsier
10 294 Le Boune?
10 295   Por. God made him, and therefore let him passe for a
10 296 man, in truth I know it is a sinne to be a mocker, but he,
10 297 why he hath a horse better then the Neopolitans, a better
10 298 bad habite of frowning then the Count Palentine, he
10 299 is euery man in no man, if a Trassell sing, he fals straight
10 300 a capring, he will fence with his owne shadow. If I should
10 301 marry him, I should marry twentie husbands: if hee
10 302 would despise me, I would forgiue him, for if he loue me
10 303 to madnesse, I should neuer requite him
10 304 
10 305    Ner. What say you then to Fauconbridge, the yong
10 306 Baron of England?
10 307   Por. You know I say nothing to him, for hee vnderstands
10 308 not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latine, French,
10 309 nor Italian, and you will come into the Court & sweare
10 310 that I haue a poore pennie-worth in the English: hee is a
10 311 proper mans picture, but alas who can conuerse with a
10 312 dumbe show? how odly he is suited, I thinke he bought
10 313 his doublet in Italie, his round hose in France, his bonnet
10 314 in Germanie, and his behauiour euery where
10 315 
10 316    Ner. What thinke you of the other Lord his neighbour?
10 317   Por. That he hath a neighbourly charitie in him, for
10 318 he borrowed a boxe of the eare of the Englishman, and
10 319 swore he would pay him againe when hee was able: I
10 320 thinke the Frenchman became his suretie, and seald vnder
10 321 for another
10 322 
10 323    Ner. How like you the yong Germaine, the Duke of
10 324 Saxonies Nephew?
10 325   Por. Very vildely in the morning when hee is sober,
10 326 and most vildely in the afternoone when hee is drunke:
10 327 when he is best, he is a little worse then a man, and when
10 328 he is worst, he is little better then a beast: and the worst
10 329 fall that euer fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without
10 330 him
10 331 
10 332    Ner. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
10 333 Casket, you should refuse to performe your Fathers will,
10 334 if you should refuse to accept him
10 335 
10 336    Por. Therefore for feare of the worst, I pray thee set
10 337 a deepe glasse of Reinish-wine on the contrary Casket,
10 338 for if the diuell be within, and that temptation without,
10 339 I know he will choose it. I will doe any thing Nerrissa
10 340 ere I will be married to a spunge
10 341 
10 342    Ner. You neede not feare Lady the hauing any of
10 343 these Lords, they haue acquainted me with their determinations,
10 344 which is indeede to returne to their home,
10 345 and to trouble you with no more suite, vnlesse you may
10 346 be won by some other sort then your Fathers imposition,
10 347 depending on the Caskets
10 348 
10 349    Por. If I liue to be as olde as Sibilla, I will dye as
10 350 chaste as Diana: vnlesse I be obtained by the manner
10 351 of my Fathers will: I am glad this parcell of wooers
10 352 are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but
10 353 I doate on his verie absence: and I wish them a faire departure
10 354 
10 355    Ner. Doe you not remember Ladie in your Fathers
10 356 time, a Venecian, a Scholler and a Souldior that
10 357 came hither in companie of the Marquesse of Mountferrat?
10 358   Por. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I thinke, so was hee
10 359 call'd
10 360 
10 361    Ner. True Madam, hee of all the men that euer my
10 362 foolish eyes look'd vpon, was the best deseruing a faire
10 363 Lady
10 364 
10 365    Por. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy
10 366 of thy praise.
10 367 Enter a Seruingman.
10 368 
10 369   Ser. The four Strangers seeke you Madam to take
10 370 their leaue: and there is a fore-runner come from a fift,
10 371 the Prince of Moroco, who brings word the Prince his
10 372 Maister will be here to night
10 373 
10 374    Por. If I could bid the fift welcome with so good
10 375 heart as I can bid the other foure farewell, I should be
10 376 glad of his approach: if he haue the condition of a Saint,
10 377 and the complexion of a diuell, I had rather hee should
10 378 shriue me then wiue me. Come Nerrissa, sirra go before;
10 379 whiles wee shut the gate vpon one wooer, another
10 380 knocks at the doore.
10 381 
10 382 Exeunt.
10 383 
10 384 Enter Bassanio with Shylocke the Iew.
10 385 
10 386   Shy. Three thousand ducates, well
10 387 
10 388    Bass. I sir, for three months
10 389 
10 390    Shy. For three months, well
10 391 
10 392    Bass. For the which, as I told you,
10 393 Anthonio shall be bound
10 394 
10 395    Shy. Anthonio shall become bound, well
10 396 
10 397    Bass. May you sted me? Will you pleasure me?
10 398 Shall I know your answere
10 399 
10 400    Shy. Three thousand ducats for three months,
10 401 and Anthonio bound
10 402 
10 403    Bass. Your answere to that
10 404 
10 405    Shy. Anthonio is a good man
10 406 
10 407    Bass. Haue you heard any imputation to the contrary
10 408 
10 409    Shy. Ho no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
10 410 good man, is to haue you vnderstand me that he is sufficient,
10 411 yet his meanes are in supposition: he hath an Argosie
10 412 bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies, I vnderstand
10 413 moreouer vpon the Ryalta, he hath a third at Mexico,
10 414 a fourth for England, and other ventures hee hath
10 415 squandred abroad, but ships are but boords, Saylers but
10 416 men, there be land rats, and water rats, water theeues,
10 417 and land theeues, I meane Pyrats, and then there is the
10 418 perrill of waters, windes, and rocks: the man is not withstanding
10 419 sufficient, three thousand ducats, I thinke I may
10 420 take his bond
10 421 
10 422    Bas. Be assured you may
10 423 
10 424    Iew. I will be assured I may: and that I may be assured,
10 425 I will bethinke mee, may I speake with Anthonio?
10 426   Bass. If it please you to dine with vs
10 427 
10 428    Iew. Yes, to smell porke, to eate of the habitation
10 429 which your Prophet the Nazarite coniured the diuell
10 430 into: I will buy with you, sell with you, talke with
10 431 you, walke with you, and so following: but I will
10 432 not eate with you, drinke with you, nor pray with you.
10 433 What newes on the Ryalta, who is he comes here?
10 434 Enter Anthonio.
10 435 
10 436   Bass. This is signior Anthonio
10 437 
10 438    Iew. How like a fawning publican he lookes.
10 439 I hate him for he is a Christian:
10 440 But more, for that in low simplicitie
10 441 He lends out money gratis, and brings downe
10 442 The rate of vsance here with vs in Venice.
10 443 If I can catch him once vpon the hip,
10 444 I will feede fat the ancient grudge I beare him.
10 445 He hates our sacred Nation, and he railes
10 446 Euen there where Merchants most doe congregate
10 447 On me, my bargaines, and my well-worne thrift,
10 448 Which he cals interrest: Cursed by my Trybe
10 449 If I forgiue him
10 450 
10 451    Bass. Shylock, doe you heare
10 452 
10 453    Shy. I am debating of my present store,
10 454 And by the neere gesse of my memorie
10 455 I cannot instantly raise vp the grosse
10 456 Of full three thousand ducats: what of that?
10 457 Tuball a wealthy Hebrew of my Tribe
10 458 Will furnish me: but soft, how many months
10 459 Doe you desire? Rest you faire good signior,
10 460 Your worship was the last man in our mouthes
10 461 
10 462    Ant. Shylocke, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
10 463 By taking, nor by giuing of excesse,
10 464 Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
10 465 Ile breake a custome: is he yet possest
10 466 How much he would?
10 467   Shy. I, I, three thousand ducats
10 468 
10 469    Ant. And for three months
10 470 
10 471    Shy. I had forgot, three months, you told me so.
10 472 Well then, your bond: and let me see, but heare you,
10 473 Me thoughts you said, you neither lend nor borrow
10 474 Vpon aduantage
10 475 
10 476    Ant. I doe neuer vse it
10 477 
10 478    Shy. When Iacob graz'd his vncle Labans sheepe,
10 479 This Iacob from our holy Abram was
10 480 (As his wise mother wrought in his behalfe)
10 481 The third possesser; I, he was the third
10 482 
10 483    Ant. And what of him, did he take interrest?
10 484   Shy. No, not take interest, not as you would say
10 485 Directly interest, marke what Iacob did,
10 486 When Laban and himselfe were compremyz'd
10 487 That all the eanelings which were streakt and pied
10 488 Should fall as Iacobs hier, the Ewes being rancke,
10 489 In end of Autumne turned to the Rammes,
10 490 And when the worke of generation was
10 491 Betweene these woolly breeders in the act,
10 492 The skilfull shepheard pil'd me certaine wands,
10 493 And in the dooing of the deede of kinde,
10 494 He stucke them vp before the fulsome Ewes,
10 495 Who then conceauing, did in eaning time
10 496 Fall party-colour'd lambs, and those were Iacobs.
10 497 This was a way to thriue, and he was blest:
10 498 And thrift is blessing if men steale it not
10 499 
10 500    Ant. This was a venture sir that Iacob seru'd for,
10 501 A thing not in his power to bring to passe,
10 502 But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heauen.
10 503 Was this inserted to make interrest good?
10 504 Or is your gold and siluer Ewes and Rams?
10 505   Shy. I cannot tell, I make it breede as fast,
10 506 But note me signior
10 507 
10 508    Ant. Marke you this Bassanio,
10 509 The diuell can cite Scripture for his purpose,
10 510 An euill soule producing holy witnesse,
10 511 Is like a villaine with a smiling cheeke,
10 512 A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
10 513 O what a goodly outside falsehood hath
10 514 
10 515    Shy. Three thousand ducats, 'tis a good round sum.
10 516 Three months from twelue, then let me see the rate
10 517 
10 518    Ant. Well Shylocke, shall we be beholding to you?
10 519   Shy. Signior Anthonio, many a time and oft
10 520 In the Ryalto you haue rated me
10 521 About my monies and my vsances:
10 522 Still haue I borne it with a patient shrug,
10 523 (For suffrance is the badge of all our Tribe.)
10 524 You call me misbeleeuer, cut-throate dog,
10 525 And spet vpon my Iewish gaberdine,
10 526 And all for vse of that which is mine owne.
10 527 Well then, it now appeares you neede my helpe:
10 528 Goe to then, you come to me, and you say,
10 529 Shylocke, we would haue moneyes, you say so:
10 530 You that did voide your rume vpon my beard,
10 531 And foote me as you spurne a stranger curre
10 532 Ouer your threshold, moneyes is your suite.
10 533 What should I say to you? Should I not say,
10 534 Hath a dog money? Is it possible
10 535 A curre should lend three thousand ducats? or
10 536 Shall I bend low, and in a bond-mans key
10 537 With bated breath, and whispring humblenesse,
10 538 Say this: Faire sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;
10 539 You spurn'd me such a day; another time
10 540 You cald me dog: and for these curtesies
10 541 Ile lend you thus much moneyes
10 542 
10 543    Ant. I am as like to call thee so againe,
10 544 To spet on thee againe, to spurne thee too.
10 545 If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
10 546 As to thy friends, for when did friendship take
10 547 A breede of barraine mettall of his friend?
10 548 But lend it rather to thine enemie,
10 549 Who if he breake, thou maist with better face
10 550 Exact the penalties
10 551 
10 552    Shy. Why looke you how you storme,
10 553 I would be friends with you, and haue your loue,
10 554 Forget the shames that you haue staind me with,
10 555 Supplie your present wants, and take no doite
10 556 Of vsance for my moneyes, and youle not heare me,
10 557 This is kinde I offer
10 558 
10 559    Bass. This were kindnesse
10 560 
10 561    Shy. This kindnesse will I showe,
10 562 Goe with me to a Notarie, seale me there
10 563 Your single bond, and in a merrie sport
10 564 If you repaie me not on such a day,
10 565 In such a place, such sum or sums as are
10 566 Exprest in the condition, let the forfeite
10 567 Be nominated for an equall pound
10 568 Of your faire flesh, to be cut off and taken
10 569 In what part of your bodie it pleaseth me
10 570 
10 571    Ant. Content infaith, Ile seale to such a bond,
10 572 And say there is much kindnesse in the Iew
10 573 
10 574    Bass. You shall not seale to such a bond for me,
10 575 Ile rather dwell in my necessitie
10 576 
10 577    Ant. Why feare not man, I will not forfaite it,
10 578 Within these two months, that's a month before
10 579 This bond expires, I doe expect returne
10 580 Of thrice three times the valew of this bond
10 581 
10 582    Shy. O father Abram, what these Christians are,
10 583 Whose owne hard dealings teaches them suspect
10 584 The thoughts of others: Praie you tell me this,
10 585 If he should breake his daie, what should I gaine
10 586 By the exaction of the forfeiture?
10 587 A pound of mans flesh taken from a man,
10 588 Is not so estimable, profitable neither
10 589 As flesh of Muttons, Beefes, or Goates, I say
10 590 To buy his fauour, I extend this friendship,
10 591 If he will take it, so: if not adiew,
10 592 And for my loue I praie you wrong me not
10 593 
10 594    Ant. Yes Shylocke, I will seale vnto this bond
10 595 
10 596    Shy. Then meete me forthwith at the Notaries,
10 597 Giue him direction for this merrie bond,
10 598 And I will goe and purse the ducats straite.
10 599 See to my house left in the fearefull gard
10 600 Of an vnthriftie knaue: and presentlie
10 601 Ile be with you.
10 602 Enter.
10 603 
10 604   Ant. Hie thee gentle Iew. This Hebrew will turne
10 605 Christian, he growes kinde
10 606 
10 607    Bass. I like not faire tearmes, and a villaines minde
10 608 
10 609    Ant. Come on, in this there can be no dismaie,
10 610 My Shippes come home a month before the daie.
10 611 
10 612 Exeunt.
10 613 
10 614 
10 615 Actus Secundus.
10 616 
10 617 Enter Morochus a tawnie Moore all in white, and three or foure
10 618 followers
10 619 accordingly, with Portia, Nerrissa, and their traine. Flo. Cornets.
10 620 
10 621   Mor. Mislike me not for my complexion,
10 622 The shadowed liuerie of the burnisht sunne,
10 623 To whom I am a neighbour, and neere bred.
10 624 Bring me the fairest creature North-ward borne,
10 625 Where Phoebus fire scarce thawes the ysicles,
10 626 And let vs make incision for your loue,
10 627 To proue whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
10 628 I tell thee Ladie this aspect of mine
10 629 Hath feard the valiant, (by my loue I sweare)
10 630 The best regarded Virgins of our Clyme
10 631 Haue lou'd it to: I would not change this hue,
10 632 Except to steale your thoughts my gentle Queene
10 633 
10 634    Por. In tearmes of choise I am not solie led
10 635 By nice direction of a maidens eies:
10 636 Besides, the lottrie of my destenie
10 637 Bars me the right of voluntarie choosing:
10 638 But if my Father had not scanted me,
10 639 And hedg'd me by his wit to yeelde my selfe
10 640 His wife, who wins me by that meanes I told you,
10 641 Your selfe (renowned Prince) than stood as faire
10 642 As any commer I haue look'd on yet
10 643 For my affection
10 644 
10 645    Mor. Euen for that I thanke you,
10 646 Therefore I pray you leade me to the Caskets
10 647 To trie my fortune: By this Symitare
10 648 That slew the Sophie, and a Persian Prince
10 649 That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
10 650 I would ore-stare the sternest eies that looke:
10 651 Out-braue the heart most daring on the earth:
10 652 Plucke the yong sucking Cubs from the she Beare,
10 653 Yea, mocke the Lion when he rores for pray
10 654 To win the Ladie. But alas, the while
10 655 If Hercules and Lychas plaie at dice
10 656 Which is the better man, the greater throw
10 657 May turne by fortune from the weaker hand:
10 658 So is Alcides beaten by his rage,
10 659 And so may I, blinde fortune leading me
10 660 Misse that which one vnworthier may attaine,
10 661 And die with grieuing
10 662 
10 663    Port. You must take your chance,
10 664 And either not attempt to choose at all,
10 665 Or sweare before you choose, if you choose wrong
10 666 Neuer to speake to Ladie afterward
10 667 In way of marriage, therefore be aduis'd
10 668 
10 669    Mor. Nor will not, come bring me vnto my chance
10 670 
10 671    Por. First forward to the temple, after dinner
10 672 Your hazard shall be made
10 673 
10 674    Mor. Good fortune then,
10 675 
10 676 Cornets.
10 677 
10 678 To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
10 679 
10 680 Exeunt.
10 681 
10 682 Enter the Clowne alone.
10 683 
10 684   Clo. Certainely, my conscience will serue me to run
10 685 from this Iew my Maister: the fiend is at mine elbow,
10 686 and tempts me, saying to me, Iobbe, Launcelet Iobbe, good
10 687 Launcelet, or good Iobbe, or good Launcelet Iobbe, vse
10 688 your legs, take the start, run awaie: my conscience saies
10 689 no; take heede honest Launcelet, take heed honest Iobbe,
10 690 or as afore-said honest Launcelet Iobbe, doe not runne,
10 691 scorne running with thy heeles; well, the most coragious
10 692 fiend bids me packe, fia saies the fiend, away saies
10 693 the fiend, for the heauens rouse vp a braue minde saies
10 694 the fiend, and run; well, my conscience hanging about
10 695 the necke of my heart, saies verie wisely to me: my honest
10 696 friend Launcelet, being an honest mans sonne, or rather
10 697 an honest womans sonne, for indeede my Father did
10 698 something smack, something grow too; he had a kinde of
10 699 taste; wel, my conscience saies Lancelet bouge not, bouge
10 700 saies the fiend, bouge not saies my conscience, conscience
10 701 say I you counsaile well, fiend say I you counsaile well,
10 702 to be rul'd by my conscience I should stay with the Iew
10 703 my Maister, (who God blesse the marke) is a kinde of diuell;
10 704 and to run away from the Iew I should be ruled by
10 705 the fiend, who sauing your reuerence is the diuell himselfe:
10 706 certainely the Iew is the verie diuell incarnation,
10 707 and in my conscience, my conscience is a kinde of hard
10 708 conscience, to offer to counsaile me to stay with the Iew;
10 709 the fiend giues the more friendly counsaile: I will runne
10 710 fiend, my heeles are at your commandement, I will
10 711 runne.
10 712 Enter old Gobbe with a Basket.
10 713 
10 714   Gob. Maister yong-man, you I praie you, which is the
10 715 waie to Maister Iewes?
10 716   Lan. O heauens, this is my true begotten Father, who
10 717 being more then sand-blinde, high grauel blinde, knows
10 718 me not, I will trie confusions with him
10 719 
10 720 
10 721    Gob. Maister yong Gentleman, I praie you which is
10 722 the waie to Maister Iewes
10 723 
10 724    Laun. Turne vpon your right hand at the next turning,
10 725 but at the next turning of all on your left; marrie
10 726 at the verie next turning, turne of no hand, but turn down
10 727 indirectlie to the Iewes house
10 728 
10 729    Gob. Be Gods sonties 'twill be a hard waie to hit, can
10 730 you tell me whether one Launcelet that dwels with him
10 731 dwell with him or no
10 732 
10 733    Laun. Talke you of yong Master Launcelet, marke
10 734 me now, now will I raise the waters; talke you of yong
10 735 Maister Launcelet?
10 736   Gob. No Maister sir, but a poore mans sonne, his Father
10 737 though I say't is an honest exceeding poore man,
10 738 and God be thanked well to liue
10 739 
10 740    Lan. Well, let his Father be what a will, wee talke of
10 741 yong Maister Launcelet
10 742 
10 743    Gob. Your worships friend and Launcelet
10 744 
10 745    Laun. But I praie you ergo old man, ergo I beseech you,
10 746 talke you of yong Maister Launcelet
10 747 
10 748    Gob. Of Launcelet, ant please your maistership
10 749 
10 750    Lan. Ergo Maister Lancelet, talke not of maister Lancelet
10 751 Father, for the yong gentleman according to fates and
10 752 destinies, and such odde sayings, the sisters three, & such
10 753 branches of learning, is indeede deceased, or as you
10 754 would say in plaine tearmes, gone to heauen
10 755 
10 756    Gob. Marrie God forbid, the boy was the verie staffe
10 757 of my age, my verie prop
10 758 
10 759    Lau. Do I look like a cudgell or a houell-post, a staffe
10 760 or a prop: doe you know me Father
10 761 
10 762    Gob. Alacke the day, I know you not yong Gentleman,
10 763 but I praie you tell me, is my boy God rest his soule
10 764 aliue or dead
10 765 
10 766    Lan. Doe you not know me Father
10 767 
10 768    Gob. Alacke sir I am sand blinde, I know you not
10 769 
10 770    Lan. Nay, indeede if you had your eies you might
10 771 faile of the knowing me: it is a wise Father that knowes
10 772 his owne childe. Well, old man, I will tell you newes of
10 773 your son, giue me your blessing, truth will come to light,
10 774 murder cannot be hid long, a mans sonne may, but in the
10 775 end truth will out
10 776 
10 777    Gob. Praie you sir stand vp, I am sure you are not
10 778 Lancelet my boy
10 779 
10 780    Lan. Praie you let's haue no more fooling about
10 781 it, but giue mee your blessing: I am Lancelet your
10 782 boy that was, your sonne that is, your childe that
10 783 shall be
10 784 
10 785    Gob. I cannot thinke you are my sonne
10 786 
10 787    Lan. I know not what I shall thinke of that: but I am
10 788 Lancelet the Iewes man, and I am sure Margerie your wife
10 789 is my mother
10 790 
10 791    Gob. Her name is Margerie indeede, Ile be sworne if
10 792 thou be Lancelet, thou art mine owne flesh and blood:
10 793 Lord worshipt might he be, what a beard hast thou got;
10 794 thou hast got more haire on thy chin, then Dobbin my
10 795 philhorse has on his taile
10 796 
10 797    Lan. It should seeme then that Dobbins taile
10 798 growes backeward. I am sure he had more haire of his
10 799 taile then I haue of my face when I last saw him
10 800 
10 801    Gob. Lord how art thou chang'd: how doost thou
10 802 and thy Master agree, I haue brought him a present; how
10 803 gree you now?
10 804   Lan. Well, well, but for mine owne part, as I haue set
10 805 vp my rest to run awaie, so I will not rest till I haue run
10 806 some ground; my Maister's a verie Iew, giue him a present,
10 807 giue him a halter, I am famisht in his seruice. You
10 808 may tell euerie finger I haue with my ribs: Father I am
10 809 glad you are come, giue me your present to one Maister
10 810 Bassanio, who indeede giues rare new Liuories, if I serue
10 811 not him, I will run as far as God has anie ground. O rare
10 812 fortune, here comes the man, to him Father, for I am a
10 813 Iew if I serue the Iew anie longer.
10 814 Enter Bassanio with a follower or two.
10 815 
10 816   Bass. You may doe so, but let it be so hasted that
10 817 supper be readie at the farthest by fiue of the clocke:
10 818 see these Letters deliuered, put the Liueries to making,
10 819 and desire Gratiano to come anone to my lodging
10 820 
10 821    Lan. To him Father
10 822 
10 823    Gob. God blesse your worship
10 824 
10 825    Bass. Gramercie, would'st thou ought with me
10 826 
10 827    Gob. Here's my sonne sir, a poore boy
10 828 
10 829    Lan. Not a poore boy sir, but the rich Iewes man that
10 830 would sir as my Father shall specifie
10 831 
10 832    Gob. He hath a great infection sir, as one would say
10 833 to serue
10 834 
10 835    Lan. Indeede the short and the long is, I serue the
10 836 Iew, and haue a desire as my Father shall specifie
10 837 
10 838    Gob. His Maister and he (sauing your worships reuerence)
10 839 are scarce catercosins
10 840 
10 841    Lan. To be briefe, the verie truth is, that the Iew
10 842 hauing done me wrong, doth cause me as my Father being
10 843 I hope an old man shall frutifie vnto you
10 844 
10 845    Gob. I haue here a dish of Doues that I would bestow
10 846 vpon your worship, and my suite is
10 847 
10 848    Lan. In verie briefe, the suite is impertinent to my
10 849 selfe, as your worship shall know by this honest old man,
10 850 and though I say it, though old man, yet poore man my
10 851 Father
10 852 
10 853    Bass. One speake for both, what would you?
10 854   Lan. Serue you sir
10 855 
10 856    Gob. That is the verie defect of the matter sir
10 857 
10 858    Bass. I know thee well, thou hast obtain'd thy suite,
10 859 Shylocke thy Maister spoke with me this daie,
10 860 And hath prefer'd thee, if it be preferment
10 861 To leaue a rich Iewes seruice, to become
10 862 The follower of so poore a Gentleman
10 863 
10 864    Clo. The old prouerbe is verie well parted betweene
10 865 my Maister Shylocke and you sir, you haue the grace of
10 866 God sir, and he hath enough
10 867 
10 868    Bass. Thou speak'st well; go Father with thy Son,
10 869 Take leaue of thy old Maister, and enquire
10 870 My lodging out, giue him a Liuerie
10 871 More garded then his fellowes: see it done
10 872 
10 873    Clo. Father in, I cannot get a seruice, no, I haue nere
10 874 a tongue in my head, well: if anie man in Italie haue a
10 875 fairer table which doth offer to sweare vpon a booke, I
10 876 shall haue good fortune; goe too, here's a simple line
10 877 of life, here's a small trifle of wiues, alas, fifteene wiues
10 878 is nothing, a leuen widdowes and nine maides is a simple
10 879 comming in for one man, and then to scape drowning
10 880 thrice, and to be in perill of my life with the edge
10 881 of a featherbed, here are simple scapes: well, if Fortune
10 882 be a woman, she's a good wench for this gere: Father
10 883 come, Ile take my leaue of the Iew in the twinkling.
10 884 
10 885 Exit Clowne.
10 886 
10 887   Bass. I praie thee good Leonardo thinke on this,
10 888 These things being bought and orderly bestowed
10 889 Returne in haste, for I doe feast to night
10 890 My best esteemd acquaintance, hie thee goe

10 901 
10 902    Gra. Signior Bassanio
10 903 
10 904    Bas. Gratiano
10 905 
10 906    Gra. I haue a sute to you
10 907 
10 908    Bass. You haue obtain'd it
10 909 
10 910    Gra. You must not denie me, I must goe with you to
10 911 Belmont
10 912 
10 913    Bass. Why then you must: but heare thee Gratiano,
10 914 Thou art to wilde, to rude, and bold of voyce,
10 915 Parts that become thee happily enough,
10 916 And in such eyes as ours appeare not faults;
10 917 But where they are not knowne, why there they show
10 918 Something too liberall, pray thee take paine
10 919 To allay with some cold drops of modestie
10 920 Thy skipping spirit, least through thy wilde behauiour
10 921 I be misconsterd in the place I goe to,
10 922 And loose my hopes
10 923 
10 924    Gra. Signor Bassanio, heare me,
10 925 If I doe not put on a sober habite,
10 926 Talke with respect, and sweare but now and than,
10 927 Weare prayer bookes in my pocket, looke demurely,
10 928 Nay more, while grace is saying hood mine eyes
10 929 Thus with my hat, and sigh and say Amen:
10 930 Vse all the obseruance of ciuillitie
10 931 Like one well studied in a sad ostent
10 932 To please his Grandam, neuer trust me more
10 933 
10 934    Bas. Well, we shall see your bearing
10 935 
10 936    Gra. Nay but I barre to night, you shall not gage me
10 937 By what we doe to night
10 938 
10 939    Bas. No that were pittie,
10 940 I would intreate you rather to put on
10 941 Your boldest suite of mirth, for we haue friends
10 942 That purpose merriment: but far you well,
10 943 I haue some businesse
10 944 
10 945    Gra. And I must to Lorenso and the rest,

10 948 Exeunt.
10 949 
10 950 Enter Iessica and the Clowne.
10 951 
10 952   Ies. I am sorry thou wilt leaue my Father so,
10 953 Our house is hell, and thou a merrie diuell
10 954 Did'st rob it of some taste of tediousnesse;
10 955 But far thee well, there is a ducat for thee,
10 956 And Lancelet, soone at supper shalt thou see
10 957 Lorenzo, who is thy new Maisters guest,
10 958 Giue him this Letter, doe it secretly,
10 959 And so farewell: I would not haue my Father
10 960 see me talke with thee
10 961 
10 962 
10 963    Clo. Adue, teares exhibit my tongue, most beautifull
10 964 Pagan, most sweete Iew, if a Christian doe not play the
10 965 knaue and get thee, I am much deceiued; but adue, these
10 966 foolish drops doe somewhat drowne my manly spirit:
10 967 adue.
10 968 Enter.
10 969 
10 970   Ies. Farewell good Lancelet.
10 971 Alacke, what hainous sinne is it in me
10 972 To be ashamed to be my Fathers childe,
10 973 But though I am a daughter to his blood,
10 974 I am not to his manners: O Lorenzo,
10 975 If thou keepe promise I shall end this strife,
10 976 Become a Christian, and thy louing wife.
10 977 Enter.
10 978 
10 979 Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salarino, and Salanio.
10 980 
10 981   Lor. Nay, we will slinke away in supper time,
10 982 Disguise vs at my lodging, and returne all in an houre
10 983 
10 984    Gra. We haue not made good preparation
10 985 
10 986    Sal. We haue not spoke vs yet of Torch-bearers
10 987 
10 988    Sol. 'Tis vile vnlesse it may be quaintly ordered,
10 989 And better in my minde not vndertooke
10 990 
10 991    Lor. 'Tis now but foure of clock, we haue two houres
10 992 To furnish vs; friend Lancelet what's the newes.
10 993 Enter Lancelet with a Letter.
10 994 
10 995   Lan. And it shall please you to breake vp this, shall it
10 996 seeme to signifie
10 997 
10 998    Lor. I know the hand, in faith 'tis a faire hand
10 999 And whiter then the paper it writ on,
10 1000 Is the faire hand that writ
10 1001 
10 1002    Gra. Loue newes in faith
10 1003 
10 1004    Lan. By your leaue sir

10 1006    Lor. Whither goest thou?
10 1007   Lan. Marry sir to bid my old Master the Iew to sup
10 1008 to night with my new Master the Christian
10 1009 
10 1010    Lor. Hold here, take this, tell gentle Iessica
10 1011 I will not faile her, speake it priuately:
10 1012 Go Gentlemen, will you prepare you for this Maske to
10 1013 night,
10 1014 I am prouided of a Torch-bearer.
10 1015 
10 1016 Exit. Clowne
10 1017 
10 1018    Sal. I marry, ile be gone about it strait
10 1019 
10 1020    Sol. And so will I
10 1021 
10 1022    Lor. Meete me and Gratiano at Gratianos lodging
10 1023 Some houre hence
10 1024 
10 1025    Sal. 'Tis good we do so.
10 1026 Enter.
10 1027 
10 1028   Gra. Was not that Letter from faire Iessica?
10 1029   Lor. I must needes tell thee all, she hath directed
10 1030 How I shall take her from her Fathers house,
10 1031 What gold and iewels she is furnisht with,
10 1032 What Pages suite she hath in readinesse:
10 1033 If ere the Iew her Father come to heauen,
10 1034 It will be for his gentle daughters sake;
10 1035 And neuer dare misfortune crosse her foote,
10 1036 Vnlesse she doe it vnder this excuse,
10 1037 That she is issue to a faithlesse Iew:
10 1038 Come goe with me, pervse this as thou goest,
10 1039 Faire Iessica shall be my Torch-bearer.
10 1040 Enter.
10 1041 
10 1042 Enter Iew, and his man that was the Clowne.
10 1043 
10 1044   Iew. Well, thou shall see, thy eyes shall be thy iudge,
10 1045 The difference of old Shylocke and Bassanio;
10 1046 What Iessica, thou shalt not gurmandize
10 1047 As thou hast done with me: what Iessica?
10 1048 And sleepe, and snore, and rend apparrell out.
10 1049 Why Iessica I say
10 1050 
10 1051    Clo. Why Iessica
10 1052 
10 1053    Shy. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call
10 1054 
10 1055    Clo. Your worship was wont to tell me
10 1056 I could doe nothing without bidding.
10 1057 Enter Iessica.
10 1058 
10 1059   Ies. Call you? what is your will?
10 1060   Shy. I am bid forth to supper Iessica,
10 1061 There are my Keyes: but wherefore should I go?
10 1062 I am not bid for loue, they flatter me,
10 1063 But yet Ile goe in hate, to feede vpon
10 1064 The prodigall Christian. Iessica my girle,
10 1065 Looke to my house, I am right loath to goe,
10 1066 There is some ill a bruing towards my rest,
10 1067 For I did dreame of money bags to night
10 1068 
10 1069    Clo. I beseech you sir goe, my yong Master
10 1070 Doth expect your reproach
10 1071 
10 1072    Shy. So doe I his
10 1073 
10 1074    Clo. And they haue conspired together, I will not say
10 1075 you shall see a Maske, but if you doe, then it was not for
10 1076 nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on blacke monday
10 1077 last, at six a clocke ith morning, falling out that yeere on
10 1078 ashwensday was foure yeere in th' afternoone
10 1079 
10 1080    Shy. What are their maskes? heare you me Iessica,
10 1081 Lock vp my doores, and when you heare the drum
10 1082 And the vile squealing of the wry-neckt Fife,
10 1083 Clamber not you vp to the casements then,
10 1084 Nor thrust your head into the publique streete
10 1085 To gaze on Christian fooles with varnisht faces:
10 1086 But stop my houses eares, I meane my casements,
10 1087 Let not the sound of shallow fopperie enter
10 1088 My sober house. By Iacobs staffe I sweare,
10 1089 I haue no minde of feasting forth to night:
10 1090 But I will goe: goe you before me sirra,
10 1091 Say I will come
10 1092 
10 1093    Clo. I will goe before sir,
10 1094 Mistris looke out at window for all this;
10 1095 There will come a Christian by,
10 1096 Will be worth a Iewes eye
10 1097 
10 1098    Shy. What saies that foole of Hagars off-spring?
10 1099 ha
10 1100 
10 1101    Ies. His words were farewell mistris, nothing else
10 1102 
10 1103    Shy. The patch is kinde enough, but a huge feeder:
10 1104 Snaile-slow in profit, but he sleepes by day
10 1105 More then the wilde-cat: drones hiue not with me,
10 1106 Therefore I part with him, and part with him
10 1107 To one that I would haue him helpe to waste
10 1108 His borrowed purse. Well Iessica goe in,
10 1109 Perhaps I will returne immediately;
10 1110 Doe as I bid you, shut dores after you, fast binde, fast
10 1111 finde,
10 1112 A prouerbe neuer stale in thriftie minde.
10 1113 Enter.
10 1114 
10 1115   Ies. Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost,
10 1116 I haue a Father, you a daughter lost.
10 1117 Enter.
10 1118 
10 1119 Enter the Maskers, Gratiano and Salino.
10 1120 
10 1121   Gra. This is the penthouse vnder which Lorenzo
10 1122 Desired vs to make a stand
10 1123 
10 1124    Sal. His houre is almost past
10 1125 
10 1126    Gra. And it is meruaile he out-dwels his houre,
10 1127 For louers euer run before the clocke
10 1128 
10 1129    Sal. O ten times faster Venus Pidgions flye
10 1130 To steale loues bonds new made, then they are wont
10 1131 To keepe obliged faith vnforfaited
10 1132 
10 1133    Gra. That euer holds, who riseth from a feast
10 1134 With that keene appetite that he sits downe?
10 1135 Where is the horse that doth vntread againe
10 1136 His tedious measures with the vnbated fire,
10 1137 That he did pace them first: all things that are,
10 1138 Are with more spirit chased then enioy'd.
10 1139 How like a yonger or a prodigall
10 1140 The skarfed barke puts from her natiue bay,
10 1141 Hudg'd and embraced by the strumpet winde:
10 1142 How like a prodigall doth she returne
10 1143 With ouer-wither'd ribs and ragged sailes,
10 1144 Leane, rent, and begger'd by the strumpet winde?
10 1145 Enter Lorenzo.
10 1146 
10 1147   Salino. Heere comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter
10 1148 
10 1149    Lor. Sweete friends, your patience for my long abode,
10 1150 Not I, but my affaires haue made you wait;
10 1151 When you shall please to play the theeues for wiues
10 1152 Ile watch as long for you then: approach
10 1153 Here dwels my father Iew. Hoa, who's within?
10 1154 
10 1155 Iessica aboue.
10 1156 
10 1157   Iess. Who are you? tell me for more certainty,
10 1158 Albeit Ile sweare that I do know your tongue
10 1159 
10 1160    Lor. Lorenzo, and thy Loue
10 1161 
10 1162    Ies. Lorenzo certaine, and my loue indeed,
10 1163 For who loue I so much? and now who knowes
10 1164 But you Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
10 1165   Lor. Heauen and thy thoughts are witness that thou
10 1166 art
10 1167 
10 1168    Ies. Heere, catch this casket, it is worth the paines,
10 1169 I am glad 'tis night, you do not looke on me,
10 1170 For I am much asham'd of my exchange:
10 1171 But loue is blinde, and louers cannot see
10 1172 The pretty follies that themselues commit,
10 1173 For if they could, Cupid himselfe would blush
10 1174 To see me thus transformed to a boy
10 1175 
10 1176    Lor. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer
10 1177 
10 1178    Ies. What, must I hold a Candle to my shames?
10 1179 They in themselues goodsooth are too too light.
10 1180 Why, 'tis an office of discouery Loue,
10 1181 And I should be obscur'd
10 1182 
10 1183    Lor. So you are sweet,
10 1184 Euen in the louely garnish of a boy: but come at once,
10 1185 For the close night doth play the run-away,
10 1186 And we are staid for at Bassanio's feast
10 1187 
10 1188    Ies. I will make fast the doores and guild my selfe
10 1189 With some more ducats, and be with you straight
10 1190 
10 1191    Gra. Now by my hood, a gentle, and no Iew
10 1192 
10 1193    Lor. Beshrew me but I loue her heartily.
10 1194 For she is wise, if I can iudge of her.
10 1195 And faire she is, if that mine eyes be true,
10 1196 And true she is, as she hath prou'd her selfe:
10 1197 And therefore like her selfe, wise, faire, and true,
10 1198 Shall she be placed in my constant soule.
10 1199 Enter Iessica.
10 1200 
10 1201 What, art thou come? on gentlemen, away,
10 1202 Our masking mates by this time for vs stay.
10 1203 Enter.
10 1204 
10 1205 Enter Anthonio.
10 1206 
10 1207   Ant. Who's there?
10 1208   Gra. Signior Anthonio?
10 1209   Ant. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
10 1210 'Tis nine a clocke, our friends all stay for you,
10 1211 No maske to night, the winde is come about,
10 1212 Bassanio presently will goe aboord,
10 1213 I haue sent twenty out to seeke for you
10 1214 
10 1215    Gra. I am glad on't, I desire no more delight
10 1216 Then to be vnder saile, and gone to night.
10 1217 
10 1218 Exeunt.
10 1219 
10 1220 Enter Portia with Morrocho, and both their traines.
10 1221 
10 1222   Por. Goe, draw aside the curtaines, and discouer
10 1223 The seuerall Caskets to this noble Prince:
10 1224 Now make your choyse
10 1225 
10 1226    Mor. The first of gold, who this inscription beares,
10 1227 Who chooseth me, shall gaine what men desire.
10 1228 The second siluer, which this promise carries,
10 1229 Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.
10 1230 This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
10 1231 Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.
10 1232 How shall I know if I doe choose the right?
10 1233 How shall I know if I doe choose the right
10 1234 
10 1235    Por. The one of them containes my picture Prince,
10 1236 If you choose that, then I am yours withall
10 1237 
10 1238    Mor. Some God direct my iudgement, let me see,
10 1239 I will suruay the inscriptions, backe againe:
10 1240 What saies this leaden casket?
10 1241 Who chooseth me, must giue and hazard all he hath.
10 1242 Must giue, for what? for lead, hazard for lead?
10 1243 This casket threatens men that hazard all
10 1244 Doe it in hope of faire aduantages:
10 1245 A golden minde stoopes not to showes of drosse,
10 1246 Ile then nor giue nor hazard ought for lead.
10 1247 What saies the Siluer with her virgin hue?
10 1248 Who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserues.
10 1249 As much as he deserues; pause there Morocho,
10 1250 And weigh thy value with an euen hand,
10 1251 If thou beest rated by thy estimation
10 1252 Thou doost deserue enough, and yet enough
10 1253 May not extend so farre as to the Ladie:
10 1254 And yet to be afeard of my deseruing,
10 1255 Were but a weake disabling of my selfe.
10 1256 As much as I deserue, why that's the Lady.
10 1257 I doe in birth deserue her, and in fortunes,
10 1258 In graces, and in qualities of breeding:
10 1259 But more then these, in loue I doe deserue.
10 1260 What if I strai'd no farther, but chose here?
10 1261 Let's see once more this saying grau'd in gold.
10 1262 Who chooseth me shall gaine what many men desire:
10 1263 Why that's the Lady, all the world desires her:
10 1264 From the foure corners of the earth they come
10 1265 To kisse this shrine, this mortall breathing Saint.
10 1266 The Hircanion deserts, and the vaste wildes
10 1267 Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
10 1268 For Princes to come view faire Portia.
10 1269 The waterie Kingdome, whose ambitious head
10 1270 Spets in the face of heauen, is no barre
10 1271 To stop the forraine spirits, but they come
10 1272 As ore a brooke to see faire Portia.
10 1273 One of these three containes her heauenly picture.
10 1274 Is't like that Lead containes her? 'twere damnation
10 1275 To thinke so base a thought, it were too grose
10 1276 To rib her searecloath in the obscure graue:
10 1277 Or shall I thinke in Siluer she's immur'd
10 1278 Being ten times vndervalued to tride gold;
10 1279 O sinfull thought, neuer so rich a Iem
10 1280 Was set in worse then gold! They haue in England
10 1281 A coyne that beares the figure of an Angell
10 1282 Stampt in gold, but that's insculpt vpon:
10 1283 But here an Angell in a golden bed
10 1284 Lies all within. Deliuer me the key:
10 1285 Here doe I choose, and thriue I as I may
10 1286 
10 1287    Por. There take it Prince, and if my forme lye there
10 1288 Then I am yours
10 1289 
10 1290    Mor. O hell! what haue we here, a carrion death,
10 1291 Within whose emptie eye there is a written scroule;
10 1292 Ile reade the writing.
10 1293 All that glisters is not gold,
10 1294 Often haue you heard that told;
10 1295 Many a man his life hath sold
10 1296 But my outside to behold;
10 1297 Guilded timber doe wormes infold:
10 1298 Had you beene as wise as bold,
10 1299 Yong in limbs, in iudgement old,
10 1300 Your answere had not beene inscrold,
10 1301 Fareyouwell, your suite is cold,
10 1302   Mor. Cold indeede, and labour lost,
10 1303 Then farewell heate, and welcome frost:
10 1304 Portia adew, I haue too grieu'd a heart
10 1305 To take a tedious leaue: thus loosers part.
10 1306 Enter.
10 1307 
10 1308   Por. A gentle riddance: draw the curtaines, go:
10 1309 Let all of his complexion choose me so.
10 1310 
10 1311 Exeunt.
10 1312 
10 1313 Enter Salarino and Solanio.
10 1314 
10 1315   Flo. Cornets
10 1316 
10 1317    Sal. Why man I saw Bassanio vnder sayle;
10 1318 With him is Gratiano gone along;
10 1319 And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not
10 1320 
10 1321    Sol. The villaine Iew with outcries raisd the Duke.
10 1322 Who went with him to search Bassanios ship
10 1323 
10 1324    Sal. He comes too late, the ship was vndersaile;
10 1325 But there the Duke was giuen to vnderstand
10 1326 That in a Gondilo were seene together
10 1327 Lorenzo and his amorous Iessica.
10 1328 Besides, Anthonio certified the Duke
10 1329 They were not with Bassanio in his ship
10 1330 
10 1331    Sol. I neuer heard a passion so confusd,
10 1332 So strange, outragious, and so variable,
10 1333 As the dogge Iew did vtter in the streets;
10 1334 My daughter, O my ducats, O my daughter,
10 1335 Fled with a Christian, O my Christian ducats!
10 1336 Iustice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter;
10 1337 A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
10 1338 Of double ducats, stolne from me by my daughter,
10 1339 And iewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
10 1340 Stolne by my daughter: iustice, finde the girle,
10 1341 She hath the stones vpon her, and the ducats
10 1342 
10 1343    Sal. Why all the boyes in Venice follow him,
10 1344 Crying his stones, his daughter, and his ducats
10 1345 
10 1346    Sol. Let good Anthonio looke he keepe his day
10 1347 Or he shall pay for this
10 1348 
10 1349    Sal. Marry well remembred,
10 1350 I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
10 1351 Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
10 1352 The French and English, there miscaried
10 1353 A vessell of our countrey richly fraught:
10 1354 I thought vpon Anthonio when he told me,
10 1355 And wisht in silence that it were not his
10 1356 
10 1357    Sol. You were best to tell Anthonio what you heare.
10 1358 Yet doe not suddainely, for it may grieue him
10 1359 
10 1360    Sal. A kinder Gentleman treads not the earth,
10 1361 I saw Bassanio and Anthonio part,
10 1362 Bassanio told him he would make some speede
10 1363 Of his returne: he answered, doe not so,
10 1364 Slubber not businesse for my sake Bassanio,
10 1365 But stay the very riping of the time,
10 1366 And for the Iewes bond which he hath of me,
10 1367 Let it not enter in your minde of loue:
10 1368 Be merry, and imploy your chiefest thoughts
10 1369 To courtship, and such faire ostents of loue
10 1370 As shall conueniently become you there;
10 1371 And euen there his eye being big with teares,
10 1372 Turning his face, he put his hand behinde him,
10 1373 And with affection wondrous sencible
10 1374 He wrung Bassanios hand, and so they parted
10 1375 
10 1376    Sol. I thinke he onely loues the world for him,
10 1377 I pray thee let vs goe and finde him out
10 1378 And quicken his embraced heauinesse
10 1379 With some delight or other
10 1380 
10 1381    Sal. Doe we so.
10 1382 
10 1383 Exeunt.
10 1384 
10 1385 Enter Nerrissa and a Seruiture.
10 1386 
10 1387   Ner. Quick, quick I pray thee, draw the curtain strait,
10 1388 The Prince of Arragon hath tane his oath,
10 1389 And comes to his election presently.
10 1390 Enter Arragon, his traine, and Portia. Flor. Cornets.
10 1391 
10 1392   Por. Behold, there stand the caskets noble Prince,
10 1393 If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
10 1394 Straight shall our nuptiall rights be solemniz'd:
10 1395 But if thou faile, without more speech my Lord,
10 1396 You must be gone from hence immediately
10 1397 
10 1398    Ar. I am enioynd by oath to obserue three things;
10 1399 First, neuer to vnfold to any one
10 1400 Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I faile
10 1401 Of the right casket, neuer in my life
10 1402 To wooe a maide in way of marriage:
10 1403 Lastly, if I doe faile in fortune of my choyse,
10 1404 Immediately to leaue you, and be gone
10 1405 
10 1406    Por. To these iniunctions euery one doth sweare
10 1407 That comes to hazard for my worthlesse selfe
10 1408 
10 1409    Ar. And so haue I addrest me, fortune now
10 1410 To my hearts hope: gold, siluer, and base lead.
10 1411 Who chooseth me must giue and hazard all he hath.
10 1412 You shall looke fairer ere I giue or hazard.
10 1413 What saies the golden chest, ha, let me see.
10 1414 Who chooseth me, shall gaine what many men desire:
10 1415 What many men desire, that many may be meant
10 1416 By the foole multitude that choose by show,
10 1417 Not learning more then the fond eye doth teach,
10 1418 Which pries not to th' interior, but like the Martlet
10 1419 Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
10 1420 Euen in the force and rode of casualtie.
10 1421 I will not choose what many men desire,
10 1422 Because I will not iumpe with common spirits,
10 1423 And ranke me with the barbarous multitudes.
10 1424 Why then to thee thou Siluer treasure house,
10 1425 Tell me once more, what title thou doost beare;
10 1426 Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues:
10 1427 And well said too; for who shall goe about
10 1428 To cosen Fortune, and be honourable
10 1429 Without the stampe of merrit, let none presume
10 1430 To weare an vndeserued dignitie:
10 1431 O that estates, degrees, and offices,
10 1432 Were not deriu'd corruptly, and that cleare honour
10 1433 Were purchast by the merrit of the wearer;
10 1434 How many then should couer that stand bare?
10 1435 How many be commanded that command?
10 1436 How much low pleasantry would then be gleaned
10 1437 From the true seede of honor? And how much honor
10 1438 Pickt from the chaffe and ruine of the times,
10 1439 To be new varnisht: Well, but to my choise.
10 1440 Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserues.
10 1441 I will assume desert; giue me a key for this,
10 1442 And instantly vnlocke my fortunes here
10 1443 
10 1444    Por. Too long a pause for that which you finde there
10 1445 
10 1446    Ar. What's here, the portrait of a blinking idiot
10 1447 Presenting me a scedule, I will reade it:
10 1448 How much vnlike art thou to Portia?
10 1449 How much vnlike my hopes and my deseruings?
10 1450 Who chooseth me, shall haue as much as he deserues.
10 1451 Did I deserue no more then a fooles head,
10 1452 Is that my prize, are my deserts no better?
10 1453   Por. To offend and iudge are distinct offices,
10 1454 And of opposed natures
10 1455 
10 1456    Ar. What is here?
10 1457 The fier seauen times tried this,
10 1458 Seauen times tried that iudgement is,
10 1459 That did neuer choose amis,
10 1460 Some there be that shadowes kisse,
10 1461 Such haue but a shadowes blisse:
10 1462 There be fooles aliue Iwis
10 1463 Siluer'd o're, and so was this:
10 1464 Take what wife you will to bed,
10 1465 I will euer be your head:
10 1466 So be gone, you are sped
10 1467 
10 1468    Ar. Still more foole I shall appeare
10 1469 By the time I linger here,
10 1470 With one fooles head I came to woo,
10 1471 But I goe away with two.
10 1472 Sweet adue, Ile keepe my oath,
10 1473 Patiently to beare my wroath
10 1474 
10 1475    Por. Thus hath the candle sing'd the moath:
10 1476 O these deliberate fooles when they doe choose,
10 1477 They haue the wisdome by their wit to loose
10 1478 
10 1479    Ner. The ancient saying is no heresie,
10 1480 Hanging and wiuing goes by destinie
10 1481 
10 1482    Por. Come draw the curtaine Nerrissa.
10 1483 Enter Messenger.
10 1484 
10 1485   Mes. Where is my Lady?
10 1486   Por. Here, what would my Lord?
10 1487   Mes. Madam, there is a-lighted at your gate
10 1488 A yong Venetian, one that comes before
10 1489 To signifie th' approaching of his Lord,
10 1490 From whom he bringeth sensible regreets;
10 1491 To wit (besides commends and curteous breath)
10 1492 Gifts of rich value; yet I haue not seene
10 1493 So likely an Embassador of loue.
10 1494 A day in Aprill neuer came so sweete
10 1495 To show how costly Sommer was at hand,
10 1496 As this fore-spurrer comes before his Lord
10 1497 
10 1498    Por. No more I pray thee, I am halfe a-feard
10 1499 Thou wilt say anone he is some kin to thee,
10 1500 Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him:
10 1501 Come, come Nerryssa, for I long to see
10 1502 Quicke Cupids Post, that comes so mannerly
10 1503 
10 1504    Ner. Bassanio Lord, loue if thy will it be.
10 1505 
10 1506 Exeunt.
10 1507 
10 1508 
10 1509 Actus Tertius.
10 1510 
10 1511 Enter Solanio and Salarino.
10 1512 
10 1513   Sol. Now, what newes on the Ryalto?
10 1514   Sal. Why yet it liues there vncheckt, that Anthonio
10 1515 hath a ship of rich lading wrackt on the narrow Seas; the
10 1516 Goodwins I thinke they call the place, a very dangerous
10 1517 flat, and fatall, where the carcasses of many a tall ship, lye
10 1518 buried, as they say, if my gossips report be an honest woman
10 1519 of her word
10 1520 
10 1521    Sol. I would she were as lying a gossip in that, as euer
10 1522 knapt Ginger, or made her neighbours beleeue she wept
10 1523 for the death of a third husband: but it is true, without
10 1524 any slips of prolixity, or crossing the plaine high-way of
10 1525 talke, that the good Anthonio, the honest Anthonio; o that
10 1526 I had a title good enough to keepe his name company!
10 1527   Sal. Come, the full stop
10 1528 
10 1529    Sol. Ha, what sayest thou, why the end is, he hath lost
10 1530 a ship
10 1531 
10 1532    Sal. I would it might proue the end of his losses
10 1533 
10 1534    Sol. Let me say Amen betimes, least the diuell crosse
10 1535 my praier, for here he comes in the likenes of a Iew. How
10 1536 now Shylocke, what newes among the Merchants?
10 1537 Enter Shylocke.
10 1538 
10 1539   Shy. You knew none so well, none so well as you, of
10 1540 my daughters flight
10 1541 
10 1542    Sal. That's certaine, I for my part knew the Tailor
10 1543 that made the wings she flew withall
10 1544 
10 1545    Sol. And Shylocke for his owne part knew the bird was
10 1546 fledg'd, and then it is the complexion of them al to leaue
10 1547 the dam
10 1548 
10 1549    Shy. She is damn'd for it
10 1550 
10 1551    Sal. That's certaine, if the diuell may be her Iudge
10 1552 
10 1553    Shy. My owne flesh and blood to rebell
10 1554 
10 1555    Sol. Out vpon it old carrion, rebels it at these yeeres
10 1556 
10 1557    Shy. I say my daughter is my flesh and bloud
10 1558 
10 1559    Sal. There is more difference betweene thy flesh and
10 1560 hers, then betweene Iet and Iuorie, more betweene your
10 1561 bloods, then there is betweene red wine and rennish: but
10 1562 tell vs, doe you heare whether Anthonio haue had anie
10 1563 losse at sea or no?
10 1564   Shy. There I haue another bad match, a bankrout, a
10 1565 prodigall, who dare scarce shew his head on the Ryalto,
10 1566 a begger that was vsd to come so smug vpon the Mart:
10 1567 let him look to his bond, he was wont to call me Vsurer,
10 1568 let him looke to his bond, he was wont to lend money
10 1569 for a Christian curtsie, let him looke to his bond
10 1570 
10 1571    Sal. Why I am sure if he forfaite, thou wilt not take
10 1572 his flesh, what's that good for?
10 1573   Shy. To baite fish withall, if it will feede nothing
10 1574 else, it will feede my reuenge; he hath disgrac'd me, and
10 1575 hindred me halfe a million, laught at my losses, mockt at
10 1576 my gaines, scorned my Nation, thwarted my bargaines,
10 1577 cooled my friends, heated mine enemies, and what's the
10 1578 reason? I am a Iewe: Hath not a Iew eyes? hath not a
10 1579 Iew hands, organs, dementions, sences, affections, passions,
10 1580 fed with the same foode, hurt with the same weapons,
10 1581 subiect to the same diseases, healed by the same
10 1582 meanes, warmed and cooled by the same Winter and
10 1583 Sommer as a Christian is: if you pricke vs doe we not
10 1584 bleede? if you tickle vs, doe we not laugh? if you poison
10 1585 vs doe we not die? and if you wrong vs shall we not reuenge?
10 1586 if we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you
10 1587 in that. If a Iew wrong a Christian, what is his humility,
10 1588 reuenge? If a Christian wrong a Iew, what should his sufferance
10 1589 be by Christian example, why reuenge? The villanie
10 1590 you teach me I will execute, and it shall goe hard
10 1591 but I will better the instruction.
10 1592 Enter a man from Anthonio.
10 1593 
10 1594 Gentlemen, my maister Anthonio is at his house, and
10 1595 desires to speake with you both
10 1596 
10 1597    Sal. We haue beene vp and downe to seeke him.
10 1598 Enter Tuball.
10 1599 
10 1600   Sol. Here comes another of the Tribe, a third cannot
10 1601 be matcht, vnlesse the diuell himselfe turne Iew.
10 1602 
10 1603 Exeunt. Gentlemen
10 1604 
10 1605    Shy. How now Tuball, what newes from Genowa? hast
10 1606 thou found my daughter?
10 1607   Tub. I often came where I did heare of her, but cannot
10 1608 finde her
10 1609 
10 1610    Shy. Why there, there, there, there, a diamond gone
10 1611 cost me two thousand ducats in Franckford, the curse neuer
10 1612 fell vpon our Nation till now, I neuer felt it till now,
10 1613 two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious
10 1614 iewels: I would my daughter were dead at my foot,
10 1615 and the iewels in her eare: would she were hearst at my
10 1616 foote, and the duckets in her coffin: no newes of them,
10 1617 why so? and I know not how much is spent in the search:
10 1618 why thou losse vpon losse, the theefe gone with so
10 1619 much, and so much to finde the theefe, and no satisfaction,
10 1620 no reuenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights
10 1621 a my shoulders, no sighes but a my breathing, no teares
10 1622 but a my shedding
10 1623 
10 1624    Tub. Yes, other men haue ill lucke too, Anthonio as I
10 1625 heard in Genowa?
10 1626   Shy. What, what, what, ill lucke, ill lucke
10 1627 
10 1628    Tub. Hath an Argosie cast away comming from Tripolis
10 1629 
10 1630    Shy. I thanke God, I thanke God, is it true, is it true?
10 1631   Tub. I spoke with some of the Saylers that escaped
10 1632 the wracke
10 1633 
10 1634    Shy. I thanke thee good Tuball, good newes, good
10 1635 newes: ha, ha, here in Genowa
10 1636 
10 1637    Tub. Your daughter spent in Genowa, as I heard, one
10 1638 night fourescore ducats
10 1639 
10 1640    Shy. Thou stick'st a dagger in me, I shall neuer see my
10 1641 gold againe, fourescore ducats at a sitting, fourescore ducats
10 1642 
10 1643    Tub. There came diuers of Anthonios creditors in my
10 1644 company to Venice, that sweare hee cannot choose but
10 1645 breake
10 1646 
10 1647    Shy. I am very glad of it, ile plague him, ile torture
10 1648 him, I am glad of it,
10 1649   Tub. One of them shewed me a ring that hee had of
10 1650 your daughter for a Monkie
10 1651 
10 1652    Shy. Out vpon her, thou torturest me Tuball, it was
10 1653 my Turkies, I had it of Leah when I was a Batcheler: I
10 1654 would not haue giuen it for a wildernesse of Monkies
10 1655 
10 1656    Tub. But Anthonio is certainely vndone
10 1657 
10 1658    Shy. Nay, that's true, that's very true, goe Tuball, see
10 1659 me an Officer, bespeake him a fortnight before, I will
10 1660 haue the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice,
10 1661 I can make what merchandize I will: goe Tuball,
10 1662 and meete me at our Sinagogue, goe good Tuball, at our
10 1663 Sinagogue Tuball.
10 1664 
10 1665 Exeunt.
10 1666 
10 1667 Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, and all their traine.
10 1668 
10 1669   Por. I pray you tarrie, pause a day or two
10 1670 Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong
10 1671 I loose your companie; therefore forbeare a while,
10 1672 There's something tels me (but it is not loue)
10 1673 I would not loose you, and you know your selfe,
10 1674 Hate counsailes not in such a quallitie;
10 1675 But least you should not vnderstand me well,
10 1676 And yet a maiden hath no tongue, but thought,
10 1677 I would detaine you here some month or two
10 1678 Before you venture for me. I could teach you
10 1679 How to choose right, but then I am forsworne,
10 1680 So will I neuer be, so may you misse me,
10 1681 But if you doe, youle make me wish a sinne,
10 1682 That I had beene forsworne: Beshrow your eyes,
10 1683 They haue ore-lookt me and deuided me,
10 1684 One halfe of me is yours, the other halfe yours,
10 1685 Mine owne I would say: but of mine then yours,
10 1686 And so all yours; O these naughtie times
10 1687 Puts bars betweene the owners and their rights.
10 1688 And so though yours, not yours (proue it so)
10 1689 Let Fortune goe to hell for it, not I.
10 1690 I speake too long, but 'tis to peize the time,
10 1691 To ich it, and to draw it out in length,
10 1692 To stay you from election
10 1693 
10 1694    Bass. Let me choose,
10 1695 For as I am, I liue vpon the racke
10 1696 
10 1697    Por. Vpon the racke Bassanio, then confesse
10 1698 What treason there is mingled with your loue
10 1699 
10 1700    Bass. None but that vglie treason of mistrust.
10 1701 Which makes me feare the enioying of my loue:
10 1702 There may as well be amitie and life,
10 1703 'Tweene snow and fire, as treason and my loue
10 1704 
10 1705    Por. I, but I feare you speake vpon the racke,
10 1706 Where men enforced doth speake any thing
10 1707 
10 1708    Bass. Promise me life, and ile confesse the truth
10 1709 
10 1710    Por. Well then, confesse and liue
10 1711 
10 1712    Bass. Confesse and loue
10 1713 Had beene the verie sum of my confession:
10 1714 O happie torment, when my torturer
10 1715 Doth teach me answers for deliuerance:
10 1716 But let me to my fortune and the caskets
10 1717 
10 1718    Por. Away then, I am lockt in one of them,
10 1719 If you doe loue me, you will finde me out.
10 1720 Nerryssa and the rest, stand all aloofe,
10 1721 Let musicke sound while he doth make his choise,
10 1722 Then if he loose he makes a Swan-like end,
10 1723 Fading in musique. That the comparison
10 1724 May stand more proper, my eye shall be the streame
10 1725 And watrie death-bed for him: he may win,
10 1726 And what is musique than? Than musique is
10 1727 Euen as the flourish, when true subiects bowe
10 1728 To a new crowned Monarch: Such it is,
10 1729 As are those dulcet sounds in breake of day,
10 1730 That creepe into the dreaming bride-groomes eare,
10 1731 And summon him to marriage. Now he goes
10 1732 With no lesse presence, but with much more loue
10 1733 Then yong Alcides, when he did redeeme
10 1734 The virgine tribute, paied by howling Troy
10 1735 To the Sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice,
10 1736 The rest aloofe are the Dardanian wiues:
10 1737 With bleared visages come forth to view
10 1738 The issue of th' exploit: Goe Hercules,
10 1739 Liue thou, I liue with much more dismay
10 1740 I view the sight, then thou that mak'st the fray.
10 1741 
10 1742 Here Musicke. A Song the whilst Bassanio comments on the
10 1743 Caskets to
10 1744 himselfe.
10 1745 
10 1746 Tell me where is fancie bred,
10 1747 Or in the heart, or in the head:
10 1748 How begot, how nourished. Replie, replie.
10 1749 It is engendred in the eyes,
10 1750 With gazing fed, and Fancie dies,
10 1751 In the cradle where it lies:
10 1752 Let vs all ring Fancies knell.
10 1753 Ile begin it.
10 1754 Ding, dong, bell
10 1755 
10 1756    All. Ding, dong, bell
10 1757 
10 1758    Bass. So may the outward showes be least themselues
10 1759 The world is still deceiu'd with ornament.
10 1760 In Law, what Plea so tainted and corrupt,
10 1761 But being season'd with a gracious voice,
10 1762 Obscures the show of euill? In Religion,
10 1763 What damned error, but some sober brow
10 1764 Will blesse it, and approue it with a text,
10 1765 Hiding the grosenesse with faire ornament:
10 1766 There is no voice so simple, but assumes
10 1767 Some marke of vertue on his outward parts;
10 1768 How manie cowards, whose hearts are all as false
10 1769 As stayers of sand, weare yet vpon their chins
10 1770 The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,
10 1771 Who inward searcht, haue lyuers white as milke,
10 1772 And these assume but valors excrement,
10 1773 To render them redoubted. Looke on beautie,
10 1774 And you shall see 'tis purchast by the weight,
10 1775 Which therein workes a miracle in nature,
10 1776 Making them lightest that weare most of it:
10 1777 So are those crisped snakie golden locks
10 1778 Which makes such wanton gambols with the winde
10 1779 Vpon supposed fairenesse, often knowne
10 1780 To be the dowrie of a second head,
10 1781 The scull that bred them in the Sepulcher.
10 1782 Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
10 1783 To a most dangerous sea: the beautious scarfe
10 1784 Vailing an Indian beautie; In a word,
10 1785 The seeming truth which cunning times put on
10 1786 To intrap the wisest. Therefore then thou gaudie gold,
10 1787 Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,
10 1788 Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
10 1789 'Tweene man and man: but thou, thou meager lead
10 1790 Which rather threatnest then dost promise ought,
10 1791 Thy palenesse moues me more then eloquence,
10 1792 And here choose I, ioy be the consequence
10 1793 
10 1794    Por. How all the other passions fleet to ayre,
10 1795 As doubtfull thoughts, and rash imbrac'd despaire:
10 1796 And shuddring feare, and greene-eyed iealousie.
10 1797 O loue be moderate, allay thy extasie,
10 1798 In measure raine thy ioy, scant this excesse,
10 1799 I feele too much thy blessing, make it lesse,
10 1800 For feare I surfeit
10 1801 
10 1802    Bas. What finde I here?
10 1803 Faire Portias counterfeit. What demie God
10 1804 Hath come so neere creation? moue these eies?
10 1805 Or whether riding on the bals of mine
10 1806 Seeme they in motion? Here are seuer'd lips
10 1807 Parted with suger breath, so sweet a barre
10 1808 Should sunder such sweet friends: here in her haires
10 1809 The Painter plaies the Spider, and hath wouen
10 1810 A golden mesh t' intrap the hearts of men
10 1811 Faster then gnats in cobwebs: but her eies,
10 1812 How could he see to doe them? hauing made one,
10 1813 Me thinkes it should haue power to steale both his
10 1814 And leaue it selfe vnfurnisht: Yet looke how farre
10 1815 The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
10 1816 In vnderprising it, so farre this shadow
10 1817 Doth limpe behinde the substance. Here's the scroule,
10 1818 The continent, and summarie of my fortune.
10 1819 You that choose not by the view
10 1820 Chance as faire, and choose as true:
10 1821 Since this fortune fals to you,
10 1822 Be content, and seeke no new.
10 1823 If you be well pleasd with this,
10 1824 And hold your fortune for your blisse,
10 1825 Turne you where your Lady is,
10 1826 And claime her with a louing kisse
10 1827 
10 1828    Bass. A gentle scroule: Faire Lady, by your leaue,
10 1829 I come by note to giue, and to receiue,
10 1830 Like one of two contending in a prize
10 1831 That thinks he hath done well in peoples eies:
10 1832 Hearing applause and vniuersall shout,
10 1833 Giddie in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
10 1834 Whether those peales of praise be his or no.
10 1835 So thrice faire Lady stand I euen so,
10 1836 As doubtfull whether what I see be true,
10 1837 Vntill confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you
10 1838 
10 1839    Por. You see my Lord Bassiano where I stand,
10 1840 Such as I am; though for my selfe alone
10 1841 I would not be ambitious in my wish,
10 1842 To wish my selfe much better, yet for you,
10 1843 I would be trebled twenty times my selfe,
10 1844 A thousand times more faire, ten thousand times
10 1845 More rich, that onely to stand high in your account,
10 1846 I might in vertues, beauties, liuings, friends,
10 1847 Exceed account: but the full summe of me
10 1848 Is sum of nothing: which to terme in grosse,
10 1849 Is an vnlessoned girle, vnschool'd, vnpractiz'd,
10 1850 Happy in this, she is not yet so old
10 1851 But she may learne: happier then this,
10 1852 Shee is not bred so dull but she can learne;
10 1853 Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit
10 1854 Commits it selfe to yours to be directed,
10 1855 As from her Lord, her Gouernour, her King.
10 1856 My selfe, and what is mine, to you and yours
10 1857 Is now conuerted. But now I was the Lord
10 1858 Of this faire mansion, master of my seruants,
10 1859 Queene ore my selfe: and euen now, but now,
10 1860 This house, these seruants, and this same my selfe
10 1861 Are yours, my Lord, I giue them with this ring,
10 1862 Which when you part from, loose, or giue away,
10 1863 Let it presage the ruine of your loue,
10 1864 And be my vantage to exclaime on you
10 1865 
10 1866    Bass. Maddam, you haue bereft me of all words,
10 1867 Onely my bloud speakes to you in my vaines,
10 1868 And there is such confusion in my powers,
10 1869 As after some oration fairely spoke
10 1870 By a beloued Prince, there doth appeare
10 1871 Among the buzzing pleased multitude,
10 1872 Where euery something being blent together,
10 1873 Turnes to a wilde of nothing, saue of ioy
10 1874 Exprest, and not exprest: but when this ring
10 1875 Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence,
10 1876 O then be bold to say Bassanio's dead
10 1877 
10 1878    Ner. My Lord and Lady, it is now our time
10 1879 That haue stood by and seene our wishes prosper,
10 1880 To cry good ioy, good ioy my Lord and Lady
10 1881 
10 1882    Gra. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle Lady,
10 1883 I wish you all the ioy that you can wish:
10 1884 For I am sure you can wish none from me:
10 1885 And when your Honours meane to solemnize
10 1886 The bargaine of your faith: I doe beseech you
10 1887 Euen at that time I may be married too
10 1888 
10 1889    Bass. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife
10 1890 
10 1891    Gra. I thanke your Lordship, you haue got me one.
10 1892 My eyes my Lord can looke as swift as yours:
10 1893 You saw the mistres, I beheld the maid:
10 1894 You lou'd, I lou'd for intermission,
10 1895 No more pertaines to me my Lord then you;
10 1896 Your fortune stood vpon the caskets there,
10 1897 And so did mine too, as the matter falls:
10 1898 For wooing heere vntill I swet againe,
10 1899 And swearing till my very rough was dry
10 1900 With oathes of loue, at last, if promise last,
10 1901 I got a promise of this faire one heere
10 1902 To haue her loue: prouided that your fortune
10 1903 Atchieu'd her mistresse
10 1904 
10 1905    Por. Is this true Nerrissa?
10 1906   Ner. Madam it is so, so you stand pleas'd withall
10 1907 
10 1908    Bass. And doe you Gratiano meane good faith?
10 1909   Gra. Yes faith my Lord
10 1910 
10 1911    Bass. Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage
10 1912 
10 1913    Gra. Weele play with them the first boy for a thousand
10 1914 ducats
10 1915 
10 1916    Ner. What and stake downe?
10 1917   Gra. No, we shal nere win at that sport, and stake
10 1918 downe.
10 1919 But who comes heere? Lorenzo and his Infidell?
10 1920 What and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
10 1921 Enter Lorenzo, Iessica, and Salerio.
10 1922 
10 1923   Bas. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hether,
10 1924 If that the youth of my new interest heere
10 1925 Haue power to bid you welcome: by your leaue
10 1926 I bid my verie friends and Countrimen
10 1927 Sweet Portia welcome
10 1928 
10 1929    Por. So do I my Lord, they are intirely welcome
10 1930 
10 1931    Lor. I thanke your honor; for my part my Lord,
10 1932 My purpose was not to haue seene you heere,
10 1933 But meeting with Salerio by the way,
10 1934 He did intreate mee past all saying nay
10 1935 To come with him along
10 1936 
10 1937    Sal. I did my Lord,
10 1938 And I haue reason for it, Signior Anthonio
10 1939 Commends him to you
10 1940 
10 1941    Bass. Ere I ope his Letter
10 1942 I pray you tell me how my good friend doth
10 1943 
10 1944    Sal. Not sicke my Lord, vnlesse it be in minde,
10 1945 Nor wel, vnlesse in minde: his Letter there
10 1946 Wil shew you his estate.
10 1947 
10 1948 Opens the Letter.
10 1949 
10 1950   Gra. Nerrissa, cheere yond stranger, bid her welcom.
10 1951 Your hand Salerio, what's the newes from Venice?
10 1952 How doth that royal Merchant good Anthonio;
10 1953 I know he will be glad of our successe,
10 1954 We are the Iasons, we haue won the fleece
10 1955 
10 1956    Sal. I would you had won the fleece that hee hath
10 1957 lost
10 1958 
10 1959    Por. There are some shrewd contents in yond same
10 1960 Paper,
10 1961 That steales the colour from Bassianos cheeke,
10 1962 Some deere friend dead, else nothing in the world
10 1963 Could turne so much the constitution
10 1964 Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?
10 1965 With leaue Bassanio I am halfe your selfe,
10 1966 And I must freely haue the halfe of any thing
10 1967 That this same paper brings you
10 1968 
10 1969    Bass. O sweet Portia,
10 1970 Heere are a few of the vnpleasant'st words
10 1971 That euer blotted paper. Gentle Ladie
10 1972 When I did first impart my loue to you,
10 1973 I freely told you all the wealth I had
10 1974 Ran in my vaines: I was a Gentleman,
10 1975 And then I told you true: and yet deere Ladie,
10 1976 Rating my selfe at nothing, you shall see
10 1977 How much I was a Braggart, when I told you
10 1978 My state was nothing, I should then haue told you
10 1979 That I was worse then nothing: for indeede
10 1980 I haue ingag'd my selfe to a deere friend,
10 1981 Ingag'd my friend to his meere enemie
10 1982 To feede my meanes. Heere is a Letter Ladie,
10 1983 The paper as the bodie of my friend,
10 1984 And euerie word in it a gaping wound
10 1985 Issuing life blood. But is it true Salerio,
10 1986 Hath all his ventures faild, what not one hit,
10 1987 From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
10 1988 From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,
10 1989 And not one vessell scape the dreadfull touch
10 1990 Of Merchant-marring rocks?
10 1991   Sal. Not one my Lord.
10 1992 Besides, it should appeare, that if he had
10 1993 The present money to discharge the Iew,
10 1994 He would not take it: neuer did I know
10 1995 A creature that did beare the shape of man
10 1996 So keene and greedy to confound a man.
10 1997 He plyes the Duke at morning and at night,
10 1998 And doth impeach the freedome of the state
10 1999 If they deny him iustice. Twenty Merchants,
10 2000 The Duke himselfe, and the Magnificoes
10 2001 Of greatest port haue all perswaded with him,
10 2002 But none can driue him from the enuious plea
10 2003 Of forfeiture, of iustice, and his bond
10 2004 
10 2005    Iessi. When I was with him, I haue heard him sweare
10 2006 To Tuball and to Chus, his Countri-men,
10 2007 That he would rather haue Anthonio's flesh,
10 2008 Then twenty times the value of the summe
10 2009 That he did owe him: and I know my Lord,
10 2010 If law, authoritie, and power denie not,
10 2011 It will goe hard with poore Anthonio
10 2012 
10 2013    Por. Is it your deere friend that is thus in trouble?
10 2014   Bass. The deerest friend to me, the kindest man,
10 2015 The best condition'd, and vnwearied spirit
10 2016 In doing curtesies: and one in whom
10 2017 The ancient Romane honour more appeares
10 2018 Then any that drawes breath in Italie
10 2019 
10 2020    Por. What summe owes he the Iew?
10 2021   Bass. For me three thousand ducats
10 2022 
10 2023    Por. What, no more?
10 2024 Pay him sixe thousand, and deface the bond:
10 2025 Double sixe thousand, and then treble that,
10 2026 Before a friend of this description
10 2027 Shall lose a haire through Bassanio's fault.
10 2028 First goe with me to Church, and call me wife,
10 2029 And then away to Venice to your friend:
10 2030 For neuer shall you lie by Portias side
10 2031 With an vnquiet soule. You shall haue gold
10 2032 To pay the petty debt twenty times ouer.
10 2033 When it is payd, bring your true friend along,
10 2034 My maid Nerrissa, and my selfe meane time
10 2035 Will liue as maids and widdowes; come away,
10 2036 For you shall hence vpon your wedding day:
10 2037 Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheere,
10 2038 Since you are deere bought, I will loue you deere.
10 2039 But let me heare the letter of your friend.
10 2040 Sweet Bassanio, my ships haue all miscarried, my Creditors
10 2041 grow cruell, my estate is very low, my bond to the Iew is
10 2042 forfeit, and since in paying it, it is impossible I should liue, all
10 2043 debts are cleerd between you and I, if I might see you at my
10 2044 death: notwithstanding, vse your pleasure, if your loue doe not
10 2045 perswade you to come, let not my letter
10 2046 
10 2047    Por. O loue! dispach all busines and be gone
10 2048 
10 2049    Bass. Since I haue your good leaue to goe away,
10 2050 I will make hast; but till I come againe,
10 2051 No bed shall ere be guilty of my stay,
10 2052 Nor rest be interposer twixt vs twaine.
10 2053 
10 2054 Exeunt.
10 2055 
10 2056 Enter the Iew, and Solanio, and Anthonio, and the Iaylor.
10 2057 
10 2058   Iew. Iaylor, looke to him, tell not me of mercy,
10 2059 This is the foole that lends out money gratis.
10 2060 Iaylor, looke to him
10 2061 
10 2062    Ant. Heare me yet good Shylok
10 2063 
10 2064    Iew. Ile haue my bond, speake not against my bond,
10 2065 I haue sworne an oath that I will haue my bond:
10 2066 Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,
10 2067 But since I am a dog, beware my phangs,
10 2068 The Duke shall grant me iustice, I do wonder
10 2069 Thou naughty Iaylor, that thou art so fond
10 2070 To come abroad with him at his request
10 2071 
10 2072    Ant. I pray thee heare me speake
10 2073 
10 2074    Iew. Ile haue my bond, I will not heare thee speake,
10 2075 Ile haue my bond, and therefore speake no more,
10 2076 Ile not be made a soft and dull ey'd foole,
10 2077 To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yeeld
10 2078 To Christian intercessors: follow not,
10 2079 Ile haue no speaking, I will haue my bond.
10 2080 
10 2081 Exit Iew.
10 2082 
10 2083   Sol. It is the most impenetrable curre
10 2084 That euer kept with men
10 2085 
10 2086    Ant. Let him alone,
10 2087 Ile follow him no more with bootlesse prayers:
10 2088 He seekes my life, his reason well I know;
10 2089 I oft deliuer'd from his forfeitures
10 2090 Many that haue at times made mone to me,
10 2091 Therefore he hates me
10 2092 
10 2093    Sol. I am sure the Duke will neuer grant
10 2094 this forfeiture to hold
10 2095 
10 2096    An. The Duke cannot deny the course of law:
10 2097 For the commoditie that strangers haue
10 2098 With vs in Venice, if it be denied,
10 2099 Will much impeach the iustice of the State,
10 2100 Since that the trade and profit of the citty
10 2101 Consisteth of all Nations. Therefore goe,
10 2102 These greefes and losses haue so bated mee,
10 2103 That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
10 2104 To morrow, to my bloudy Creditor.
10 2105 Well Iaylor, on, pray God Bassanio come
10 2106 To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.
10 2107 
10 2108 Exeunt.
10 2109 
10 2110 Enter Portia, Nerrissa, Lorenzo, Iessica, and a man of Portias.
10 2111 
10 2112   Lor. Madam, although I speake it in your presence,
10 2113 You haue a noble and a true conceit
10 2114 Of god-like amity, which appeares most strongly
10 2115 In bearing thus the absence of your Lord.
10 2116 But if you knew to whom you shew this honour,
10 2117 How true a Gentleman you send releefe,
10 2118 How deere a louer of my Lord your husband,
10 2119 I know you would be prouder of the worke
10 2120 Then customary bounty can enforce you
10 2121 
10 2122    Por. I neuer did repent for doing good,
10 2123 Nor shall not now: for in companions
10 2124 That do conuerse and waste the time together,
10 2125 Whose soules doe beare an egal yoke of loue.
10 2126 There must be needs a like proportion
10 2127 Of lyniaments, of manners, and of spirit;
10 2128 Which makes me thinke that this Anthonio
10 2129 Being the bosome louer of my Lord,
10 2130 Must needs be like my Lord. If it be so,
10 2131 How little is the cost I haue bestowed
10 2132 In purchasing the semblance of my soule;
10 2133 From out the state of hellish cruelty,
10 2134 This comes too neere the praising of my selfe,
10 2135 Therefore no more of it: heere other things
10 2136 Lorenso I commit into your hands,
10 2137 The husbandry and mannage of my house,
10 2138 Vntill my Lords returne; for mine owne part
10 2139 I haue toward heauen breath'd a secret vow,
10 2140 To liue in prayer and contemplation,
10 2141 Onely attended by Nerrissa heere,
10 2142 Vntill her husband and my Lords returne:
10 2143 There is a monastery too miles off,
10 2144 And there we will abide. I doe desire you
10 2145 Not to denie this imposition,
10 2146 The which my loue and some necessity
10 2147 Now layes vpon you
10 2148 
10 2149    Lorens. Madame, with all my heart,
10 2150 I shall obey you in all faire commands
10 2151 
10 2152    Por. My people doe already know my minde,
10 2153 And will acknowledge you and Iessica
10 2154 In place of Lord Bassanio and my selfe.
10 2155 So far you well till we shall meete againe
10 2156 
10 2157    Lor. Faire thoughts & happy houres attend on you
10 2158 
10 2159    Iessi. I wish your Ladiship all hearts content
10 2160 
10 2161    Por. I thanke you for your wish, and am well pleas'd
10 2162 To wish it backe on you: faryouwell Iessica.
10 2163 
10 2164 Exeunt.
10 2165 
10 2166 Now Balthaser, as I haue euer found thee honest true,
10 2167 So let me finde thee still: take this same letter,
10 2168 And vse thou all the indeauor of a man,
10 2169 In speed to Mantua, see thou render this
10 2170 Into my cosins hand, Doctor Belario,
10 2171 And looke what notes and garments he doth giue thee,
10 2172 Bring them I pray thee with imagin'd speed
10 2173 Vnto the Tranect, to the common Ferrie
10 2174 Which trades to Venice; waste no time in words,
10 2175 But get thee gone, I shall be there before thee
10 2176 
10 2177    Balth. Madam, I goe with all conuenient speed
10 2178 
10 2179    Por. Come on Nerissa, I haue worke in hand
10 2180 That you yet know not of; wee'll see our husbands
10 2181 Before they thinke of vs?
10 2182   Nerrissa. Shall they see vs?
10 2183   Portia. They shall Nerrissa: but in such a habit,
10 2184 That they shall thinke we are accomplished
10 2185 With that we lacke; Ile hold thee any wager
10 2186 When we are both accoutered like yong men,
10 2187 Ile proue the prettier fellow of the two,
10 2188 And weare my dagger with the brauer grace,
10 2189 And speake betweene the change of man and boy,
10 2190 With a reede voyce, and turne two minsing steps
10 2191 Into a manly stride; and speake of frayes
10 2192 Like a fine bragging youth: and tell quaint lyes
10 2193 How honourable Ladies sought my loue,
10 2194 Which I denying, they fell sicke and died.
10 2195 I could not doe withall: then Ile repent,
10 2196 And wish for all that, that I had not kil'd them;
10 2197 And twentie of these punie lies Ile tell,
10 2198 That men shall sweare I haue discontinued schoole
10 2199 Aboue a twelue moneth: I haue within my minde
10 2200 A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Iacks,
10 2201 Which I will practise
10 2202 
10 2203    Nerris. Why, shall wee turne to men?
10 2204   Portia. Fie, what a questions that?
10 2205 If thou wert nere a lewd interpreter:
10 2206 But come, Ile tell thee all my whole deuice
10 2207 When I am in my coach, which stayes for vs
10 2208 At the Parke gate; and therefore haste away,
10 2209 For we must measure twentie miles to day.
10 2210 
10 2211 Exeunt.
10 2212 
10 2213 Enter Clowne and Iessica.
10 2214 
10 2215   Clown. Yes truly; for looke you, the sinnes of the Father
10 2216 are to be laid vpon the children, therefore I promise
10 2217 you, I feare you, I was alwaies plaine with you, and so
10 2218 now I speake my agitation of the matter: therfore be of
10 2219 good cheere, for truly I thinke you are damn'd, there is
10 2220 but one hope in it that can doe you anie good, and that is
10 2221 but a kinde of bastard hope neither
10 2222 
10 2223    Iessica. And what hope is that I pray thee?
10 2224   Clow. Marrie you may partlie hope that your father
10 2225 got you not, that you are not the Iewes daughter
10 2226 
10 2227    Ies. That were a kinde of bastard hope indeed, so the
10 2228 sins of my mother should be visited vpon me
10 2229 
10 2230    Clow. Truly then I feare you are damned both by father
10 2231 and mother: thus when I shun Scilla your father, I
10 2232 fall into Charibdis your mother; well, you are gone both
10 2233 waies
10 2234 
10 2235    Ies. I shall be sau'd by my husband, he hath made me
10 2236 a Christian
10 2237 
10 2238    Clow. Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians
10 2239 enow before, e'ne as many as could wel liue one by another:
10 2240 this making of Christians will raise the price of
10 2241 Hogs, if wee grow all to be porke-eaters, wee shall not
10 2242 shortlie haue a rasher on the coales for money.
10 2243 Enter Lorenzo.
10 2244 
10 2245   Ies. Ile tell my husband Lancelet what you say, heere
10 2246 he comes
10 2247 
10 2248    Loren. I shall grow iealous of you shortly Lancelet,
10 2249 if you thus get my wife into corners?
10 2250   Ies. Nay, you need not feare vs Lorenzo, Launcelet
10 2251 and I are out, he tells me flatly there is no mercy for mee
10 2252 in heauen, because I am a Iewes daughter: and hee saies
10 2253 you are no good member of the common wealth, for
10 2254 in conuerting Iewes to Christians, you raise the price
10 2255 of Porke
10 2256 
10 2257    Loren. I shall answere that better to the Commonwealth,
10 2258 than you can the getting vp of the Negroes bellie:
10 2259 the Moore is with childe by you Launcelet?
10 2260   Clow. It is much that the Moore should be more then
10 2261 reason: but if she be lesse then an honest woman, shee is
10 2262 indeed more then I tooke her for
10 2263 
10 2264    Loren. How euerie foole can play vpon the word, I
10 2265 thinke the best grace of witte will shortly turne into silence,
10 2266 and discourse grow commendable in none onely
10 2267 but Parrats: goe in sirra, bid them prepare for dinner?
10 2268   Clow. That is done sir, they haue all stomacks?
10 2269   Loren. Goodly Lord, what a witte-snapper are you,
10 2270 then bid them prepare dinner
10 2271 
10 2272    Clow. That is done to sir, onely couer is the word
10 2273 
10 2274    Loren. Will you couer than sir?
10 2275   Clow. Not so sir neither, I know my dutie
10 2276 
10 2277    Loren. Yet more quarreling with occasion, wilt thou
10 2278 shew the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant; I pray
10 2279 thee vnderstand a plaine man in his plaine meaning: goe
10 2280 to thy fellowes, bid them couer the table, serue in the
10 2281 meat, and we will come in to dinner
10 2282 
10 2283    Clow. For the table sir, it shall be seru'd in, for the
10 2284 meat sir, it shall bee couered, for your comming in to
10 2285 dinner sir, why let it be as humors and conceits shall gouerne.
10 2286 
10 2287 Exit Clowne.
10 2288 
10 2289   Lor. O deare discretion, how his words are suted,
10 2290 The foole hath planted in his memory
10 2291 An Armie of good words, and I doe know
10 2292 A many fooles that stand in better place,
10 2293 Garnisht like him, that for a tricksie word
10 2294 Defie the matter: how cheer'st thou Iessica,
10 2295 And now good sweet say thy opinion,
10 2296 How dost thou like the Lord Bassiano's wife?
10 2297   Iessi. Past all expressing, it is very meete
10 2298 The Lord Bassanio liue an vpright life
10 2299 For hauing such a blessing in his Lady,
10 2300 He findes the ioyes of heauen heere on earth,
10 2301 And if on earth he doe not meane it, it
10 2302 Is reason he should neuer come to heauen?
10 2303 Why, if two gods should play some heauenly match,
10 2304 And on the wager lay two earthly women,
10 2305 And Portia one: there must be something else
10 2306 Paund with the other, for the poore rude world
10 2307 Hath not her fellow
10 2308 
10 2309    Loren. Euen such a husband
10 2310 Hast thou of me, as she is for a wife
10 2311 
10 2312    Ies. Nay, but aske my opinion to of that?
10 2313   Lor. I will anone, first let vs goe to dinner?
10 2314   Ies. Nay, let me praise you while I haue a stomacke?
10 2315   Lor. No pray thee, let it serue for table talke,
10 2316 Then how som ere thou speakst 'mong other things,
10 2317 I shall digest it?
10 2318   Iessi. Well, Ile set you forth.
10 2319 
10 2320 Exeunt.
10 2321 
10 2322 
10 2323 Actus Quartus.
10 2324 
10 2325 Enter the Duke, the Magnificoes, Anthonio, Bassanio, and
10 2326 Gratiano
10 2327 
10 2328    Duke. What, is Anthonio heere?
10 2329   Ant. Ready, so please your grace?
10 2330   Duke. I am sorry for thee, thou art come to answere
10 2331 A stonie aduersary, an inhumane wretch,
10 2332 Vncapable of pitty, voyd, and empty
10 2333 From any dram of mercie
10 2334 
10 2335    Ant. I haue heard
10 2336 Your Grace hath tane great paines to qualifie
10 2337 His rigorous course: but since he stands obdurate,
10 2338 And that no lawful meanes can carrie me
10 2339 Out of his enuies reach, I do oppose
10 2340 My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
10 2341 To suffer with a quietnesse of spirit,
10 2342 The very tiranny and rage of his
10 2343 
10 2344    Du. Go one and cal the Iew into the Court
10 2345 
10 2346    Sal. He is ready at the doore, he comes my Lord.
10 2347 Enter Shylocke.
10 2348 
10 2349   Du. Make roome, and let him stand before our face.
10 2350 Shylocke the world thinkes, and I thinke so to
10 2351 That thou but leadest this fashion of thy mallice
10 2352 To the last houre of act, and then 'tis thought
10 2353 Thou'lt shew thy mercy and remorse more strange,
10 2354 Than is thy strange apparant cruelty;
10 2355 And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
10 2356 Which is a pound of this poore Merchants flesh,
10 2357 Thou wilt not onely loose the forfeiture,
10 2358 But touch'd with humane gentlenesse and loue:
10 2359 Forgiue a moytie of the principall,
10 2360 Glancing an eye of pitty on his losses
10 2361 That haue of late so hudled on his backe,
10 2362 Enow to presse a royall Merchant downe;
10 2363 And plucke commiseration of his state
10 2364 From brassie bosomes, and rough hearts of flints,
10 2365 From stubborne Turkes and Tarters neuer traind
10 2366 To offices of tender curtesie,
10 2367 We all expect a gentle answer Iew?
10 2368   Iew. I haue possest your grace of what I purpose,
10 2369 And by our holy Sabbath haue I sworne
10 2370 To haue the due and forfeit of my bond.
10 2371 If you denie it, let the danger light
10 2372 Vpon your Charter, and your Cities freedome.
10 2373 You'l aske me why I rather choose to haue
10 2374 A weight of carrion flesh, then to receiue
10 2375 Three thousand Ducats? Ile not answer that:
10 2376 But say it is my humor; Is it answered?
10 2377 What if my house be troubled with a Rat,
10 2378 And I be pleas'd to giue ten thousand Ducates
10 2379 To haue it bain'd? What, are you answer'd yet?
10 2380 Some men there are loue not a gaping Pigge:
10 2381 Some that are mad, if they behold a Cat:
10 2382 And others, when the bag-pipe sings i'th nose,
10 2383 Cannot containe their Vrine for affection.
10 2384 Masters of passion swayes it to the moode
10 2385 Of what it likes or loaths, now for your answer:
10 2386 As there is no firme reason to be rendred
10 2387 Why he cannot abide a gaping Pigge?
10 2388 Why he a harmlesse necessarie Cat?
10 2389 Why he a woollen bag-pipe: but of force
10 2390 Must yeeld to such ineuitable shame,
10 2391 As to offend himselfe being offended:
10 2392 So can I giue no reason, nor I will not,
10 2393 More then a lodg'd hate, and a certaine loathing
10 2394 I beare Anthonio, that I follow thus
10 2395 A loosing suite against him? Are you answered?
10 2396   Bass. This is no answer thou vnfeeling man,
10 2397 To excuse the currant of thy cruelty
10 2398 
10 2399    Iew. I am not bound to please thee with my answer
10 2400 
10 2401    Bass. Do all men kil the things they do not loue?
10 2402   Iew. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
10 2403   Bass. Euerie offence is not a hate at first
10 2404 
10 2405    Iew. What wouldst thou haue a Serpent sting thee
10 2406 twice?
10 2407   Ant. I pray you thinke you question with the Iew:
10 2408 You may as well go stand vpon the beach,
10 2409 And bid the maine flood baite his vsuall height,
10 2410 Or euen as well vse question with the Wolfe,
10 2411 The Ewe bleate for the Lambe:
10 2412 You may as well forbid the Mountaine Pines
10 2413 To wagge their high tops, and to make no noise
10 2414 When they are fretted with the gusts of heauen:
10 2415 You may as well do any thing most hard,
10 2416 As seeke to soften that, then which what harder?
10 2417 His Iewish heart. Therefore I do beseech you
10 2418 Make no more offers, vse no farther meanes,
10 2419 But with all briefe and plaine conueniencie
10 2420 Let me haue iudgement, and the Iew his will
10 2421 
10 2422    Bas. For thy three thousand Ducates heere is six
10 2423 
10 2424    Iew. If euerie Ducat in sixe thousand Ducates
10 2425 Were in sixe parts, and euery part a Ducate,
10 2426 I would not draw them, I would haue my bond?
10 2427   Du. How shalt thou hope for mercie, rendring none?
10 2428   Iew. What iudgement shall I dread doing no wrong?
10 2429 You haue among you many a purchast slaue,
10 2430 Which like your Asses, and your Dogs and Mules,
10 2431 You vse in abiect and in slauish parts,
10 2432 Because you bought them. Shall I say to you,
10 2433 Let them be free, marrie them to your heires?
10 2434 Why sweate they vnder burthens? Let their beds
10 2435 Be made as soft as yours: and let their pallats
10 2436 Be season'd with such Viands: you will answer
10 2437 The slaues are ours. So do I answer you.
10 2438 The pound of flesh which I demand of him
10 2439 Is deerely bought, 'tis mine, and I will haue it.
10 2440 If you deny me; fie vpon your Law,
10 2441 There is no force in the decrees of Venice;
10 2442 I stand for iudgement, answer, Shall I haue it?
10 2443   Du. Vpon my power I may dismisse this Court,
10 2444 Vnlesse Bellario a learned Doctor,
10 2445 Whom I haue sent for to determine this,
10 2446 Come heere to day
10 2447 
10 2448    Sal. My Lord, heere stayes without
10 2449 A Messenger with Letters from the Doctor,
10 2450 New come from Padua
10 2451 
10 2452    Du. Bring vs the Letters, Call the Messengers
10 2453 
10 2454    Bass. Good cheere Anthonio. What man, corage yet:
10 2455 The Iew shall haue my flesh, blood, bones, and all,
10 2456 Ere thou shalt loose for me one drop of blood
10 2457 
10 2458    Ant. I am a tainted Weather of the flocke,
10 2459 Meetest for death, the weakest kinde of fruite
10 2460 Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me;
10 2461 You cannot better be employ'd Bassanio,
10 2462 Then to liue still, and write mine Epitaph.
10 2463 Enter Nerrissa.
10 2464 
10 2465   Du. Came you from Padua from Bellario?
10 2466   Ner. From both.
10 2467 My Lord Bellario greets your Grace
10 2468 
10 2469    Bas. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
10 2470   Iew. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrout there
10 2471 
10 2472    Gra. Not on thy soale: but on thy soule harsh Iew
10 2473 Thou mak'st thy knife keene: but no mettall can,
10 2474 No, not the hangmans Axe beare halfe the keennesse
10 2475 Of thy sharpe enuy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
10 2476   Iew. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make
10 2477 
10 2478    Gra. O be thou damn'd, inexecrable dogge,
10 2479 And for thy life let iustice be accus'd:
10 2480 Thou almost mak'st me wauer in my faith;
10 2481 To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
10 2482 That soules of Animals infuse themselues
10 2483 Into the trunkes of men. Thy currish spirit
10 2484 Gouern'd a Wolfe, who hang'd for humane slaughter,
10 2485 Euen from the gallowes did his fell soule fleet;
10 2486 And whil'st thou layest in thy vnhallowed dam,
10 2487 Infus'd it selfe in thee: For thy desires
10 2488 Are Woluish, bloody, steru'd, and rauenous
10 2489 
10 2490    Iew. Till thou canst raile the seale from off my bond
10 2491 Thou but offend'st thy Lungs to speake so loud:
10 2492 Repaire thy wit good youth, or it will fall
10 2493 To endlesse ruine. I stand heere for Law
10 2494 
10 2495    Du. This Letter from Bellario doth commend
10 2496 A yong and Learned Doctor in our Court;
10 2497 Where is he?
10 2498   Ner. He attendeth heere hard by
10 2499 To know your answer, whether you'l admit him
10 2500 
10 2501    Du. With all my heart. Some three or four of you
10 2502 Go giue him curteous conduct to this place,
10 2503 Meane time the Court shall heare Bellarioes Letter.
10 2504 Your Grace shall vnderstand, that at the receite of your
10 2505 Letter I am very sicke: but in the instant that your messenger
10 2506 came, in louing visitation, was with me a yong Doctor
10 2507 of Rome, his name is Balthasar: I acquainted him with
10 2508 the cause in Controuersie, betweene the Iew and Anthonio
10 2509 the Merchant: We turn'd ore many Bookes together: hee is
10 2510 furnished with my opinion, which bettred with his owne learning,
10 2511 the greatnesse whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
10 2512 with him at my importunity, to fill vp your Graces request in
10 2513 my sted. I beseech you, let his lacke of years be no impediment
10 2514 to let him lacke a reuerend estimation: for I neuer knewe so
10 2515 yong a body, with so old a head. I leaue him to your gracious
10 2516 acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.
10 2517 Enter Portia for Balthazar.
10 2518 
10 2519   Duke. You heare the learn'd Bellario what he writes,
10 2520 And heere (I take it) is the Doctor come.
10 2521 Giue me your hand: Came you from old Bellario?
10 2522   Por. I did my Lord
10 2523 
10 2524    Du. You are welcome: take your place;
10 2525 Are you acquainted with the difference
10 2526 That holds this present question in the Court
10 2527 
10 2528    Por. I am enformed throughly of the cause.
10 2529 Which is the Merchant heere? and which the Iew?
10 2530   Du. Anthonio and old Shylocke, both stand forth
10 2531 
10 2532    Por. Is your name Shylocke?
10 2533   Iew. Shylocke is my name
10 2534 
10 2535    Por. Of a strange nature is the sute you follow,
10 2536 Yet in such rule, that the Venetian Law
10 2537 Cannot impugne you as you do proceed.
10 2538 You stand within his danger, do you not?
10 2539   Ant. I, so he sayes
10 2540 
10 2541    Por. Do you confesse the bond?
10 2542   Ant. I do
10 2543 
10 2544    Por. Then must the Iew be mercifull
10 2545 
10 2546    Iew. On what compulsion must I ? Tell me that
10 2547 
10 2548    Por. The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
10 2549 It droppeth as the gentle raine from heauen
10 2550 Vpon the place beneath. It is twice blest,
10 2551 It blesseth him that giues, and him that takes,
10 2552 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes
10 2553 The throned Monarch better then his Crowne.
10 2554 His Scepter shewes the force of temporall power,
10 2555 The attribute to awe and Maiestie,
10 2556 Wherein doth sit the dread and feare of Kings:
10 2557 But mercy is aboue this sceptred sway,
10 2558 It is enthroned in the hearts of Kings,
10 2559 It is an attribute to God himselfe;
10 2560 And earthly power doth then shew likest Gods
10 2561 When mercie seasons Iustice. Therefore Iew,
10 2562 Though Iustice be thy plea, consider this,
10 2563 That in the course of Iustice, none of vs
10 2564 Should see saluation: we do pray for mercie,
10 2565 And that same prayer, doth teach vs all to render
10 2566 The deeds of mercie. I haue spoke thus much
10 2567 To mittigate the iustice of thy plea:
10 2568 Which if thou follow, this strict course of Venice
10 2569 Must needes giue sentence 'gainst the Merchant there
10 2570 
10 2571    Shy. My deeds vpon my head, I craue the Law,
10 2572 The penaltie and forfeite of my bond
10 2573 
10 2574    Por. Is he not able to discharge the money?
10 2575   Bas. Yes, heere I tender it for him in the Court,
10 2576 Yea, twice the summe, if that will not suffice,
10 2577 I will be bound to pay it ten times ore,
10 2578 On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
10 2579 If this will not suffice, it must appeare
10 2580 That malice beares downe truth. And I beseech you
10 2581 Wrest once the Law to your authority.
10 2582 To do a great right, do a little wrong,
10 2583 And curbe this cruell diuell of his will
10 2584 
10 2585    Por. It must not be, there is no power in Venice
10 2586 Can alter a decree established:
10 2587 'Twill be recorded for a President,
10 2588 And many an error by the same example,
10 2589 Will rush into the state: It cannot be
10 2590 
10 2591    Iew. A Daniel come to iudgement, yea a Daniel.
10 2592 O wise young Iudge, how do I honour thee
10 2593 
10 2594    Por. I pray you let me looke vpon the bond
10 2595 
10 2596    Iew. Heere 'tis most reuerend Doctor, heere it is
10 2597 
10 2598    Por. Shylocke, there's thrice thy monie offered thee
10 2599 
10 2600    Shy. An oath, an oath, I haue an oath in heauen:
10 2601 Shall I lay periurie vpon my soule?
10 2602 No not for Venice
10 2603 
10 2604    Por. Why this bond is forfeit,
10 2605 And lawfully by this the Iew may claime
10 2606 A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
10 2607 Neerest the Merchants heart; be mercifull,
10 2608 Take thrice thy money, bid me teare the bond
10 2609 
10 2610    Iew. When it is paid according to the tenure.
10 2611 It doth appeare you are a worthy Iudge:
10 2612 You know the Law, your exposition
10 2613 Hath beene most sound. I charge you by the Law,
10 2614 Whereof you are a well-deseruing pillar,
10 2615 Proceede to iudgement: By my soule I sweare,
10 2616 There is no power in the tongue of man
10 2617 To alter me: I stay heere on my bond
10 2618 
10 2619    An. Most heartily I do beseech the Court
10 2620 To giue the iudgement
10 2621 
10 2622    Por. Why then thus it is:
10 2623 You must prepare your bosome for his knife
10 2624 
10 2625    Iew. O noble Iudge, O excellent yong man
10 2626 
10 2627    Por. For the intent and purpose of the Law
10 2628 Hath full relation to the penaltie,
10 2629 Which heere appeareth due vpon the bond
10 2630 
10 2631    Iew. 'Tis verie true: O wise and vpright Iudge,
10 2632 How much more elder art thou then thy lookes?
10 2633   Por. Therefore lay bare your bosome
10 2634 
10 2635    Iew. I, his brest,
10 2636 So sayes the bond, doth it not noble Iudge?
10 2637 Neerest his heart, those are the very words
10 2638 
10 2639    Por. It is so: Are there ballance heere to weigh the
10 2640 flesh?
10 2641   Iew. I haue them ready
10 2642 
10 2643    Por. Haue by some Surgeon Shylock on your charge
10 2644 To stop his wounds, least he should bleede to death
10 2645 
10 2646    Iew. It is not nominated in the bond?
10 2647   Por. It is not so exprest: but what of that?
10 2648 'Twere good you do so much for charitie
10 2649 
10 2650    Iew. I cannot finde it, 'tis not in the bond
10 2651 
10 2652    Por. Come Merchant, haue you any thing to say?
10 2653   Ant. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
10 2654 Giue me your hand Bassanio, fare you well.
10 2655 Greeue not that I am falne to this for you:
10 2656 For heerein fortune shewes her selfe more kinde
10 2657 Then is her custome. It is still her vse
10 2658 To let the wretched man out-liue his wealth,
10 2659 To view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow
10 2660 An age of pouerty. From which lingring penance
10 2661 Of such miserie, doth she cut me off:
10 2662 Commend me to your honourable Wife,
10 2663 Tell her the processe of Anthonio's end:
10 2664 Say how I lou'd you; speake me faire in death:
10 2665 And when the tale is told, bid her be iudge,
10 2666 Whether Bassanio had not once a Loue:
10 2667 Repent not you that you shall loose your friend,
10 2668 And he repents not that he payes your debt.
10 2669 For if the Iew do cut but deepe enough,
10 2670 Ile pay it instantly, with all my heart
10 2671 
10 2672    Bas. Anthonio, I am married to a wife,
10 2673 Which is as deere to me as life it selfe,
10 2674 But life it selfe, my wife, and all the world,
10 2675 Are not with me esteem'd aboue thy life.
10 2676 I would loose all, I sacrifice them all
10 2677 Heere to this deuill, to deliuer you
10 2678 
10 2679    Por. Your wife would giue you little thanks for that
10 2680 If she were by to heare you make the offer
10 2681 
10 2682    Gra. I haue a wife whom I protest I loue,
10 2683 I would she were in heauen, so she could
10 2684 Intreat some power to change this currish Iew
10 2685 
10 2686    Ner. 'Tis well you offer it behinde her backe,
10 2687 The wish would make else an vnquiet house
10 2688 
10 2689    Iew. These be the Christian husbands: I haue a daughter
10 2690 Would any of the stocke of Barrabas
10 2691 Had beene her husband, rather then a Christian.
10 2692 We trifle time, I pray thee pursue sentence
10 2693 
10 2694    Por. A pound of that same marchants flesh is thine,
10 2695 The Court awards it, and the law doth giue it
10 2696 
10 2697    Iew. Most rightfull Iudge
10 2698 
10 2699    Por. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast,
10 2700 The Law allowes it, and the Court awards it
10 2701 
10 2702    Iew. Most learned Iudge, a sentence, come prepare
10 2703 
10 2704    Por. Tarry a little, there is something else,
10 2705 This bond doth giue thee heere no iot of bloud,
10 2706 The words expresly are a pound of flesh:
10 2707 Then take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,
10 2708 But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
10 2709 One drop of Christian bloud, thy lands and goods
10 2710 Are by the Lawes of Venice confiscate
10 2711 Vnto the state of Venice
10 2712 
10 2713    Gra. O vpright Iudge,
10 2714 Marke Iew, o learned Iudge
10 2715 
10 2716    Shy. Is that the law?
10 2717   Por. Thy selfe shalt see the Act:
10 2718 For as thou vrgest iustice, be assur'd
10 2719 Thou shalt haue iustice more then thou desirest
10 2720 
10 2721    Gra. O learned Iudge, mark Iew, a learned Iudge
10 2722 
10 2723    Iew. I take this offer then, pay the bond thrice,
10 2724 And let the Christian goe
10 2725 
10 2726    Bass. Heere is the money
10 2727 
10 2728    Por. Soft, the Iew shall haue all iustice, soft, no haste,
10 2729 He shall haue nothing but the penalty
10 2730 
10 2731    Gra. O Iew, an vpright Iudge, a learned Iudge
10 2732 
10 2733    Por. Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh,
10 2734 Shed thou no bloud, nor cut thou lesse nor more
10 2735 But iust a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more
10 2736 Or lesse then a iust pound, be it so much
10 2737 As makes it light or heauy in the substance,
10 2738 Or the deuision of the twentieth part
10 2739 Of one poore scruple, nay if the scale doe turne
10 2740 But in the estimation of a hayre,
10 2741 Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate
10 2742 
10 2743    Gra. A second Daniel, a Daniel Iew,
10 2744 Now infidell I haue thee on the hip
10 2745 
10 2746    Por. Why doth the Iew pause, take thy forfeiture
10 2747 
10 2748    Shy. Giue me my principall, and let me goe
10 2749 
10 2750    Bass. I haue it ready for thee, heere it is
10 2751 
10 2752    Por. He hath refus'd it in the open Court,
10 2753 He shall haue meerly iustice and his bond
10 2754 
10 2755    Gra. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel,
10 2756 I thanke thee Iew for teaching me that word
10 2757 
10 2758    Shy. Shall I not haue barely my principall?
10 2759   Por. Thou shalt haue nothing but the forfeiture,
10 2760 To be taken so at thy perill Iew
10 2761 
10 2762    Shy. Why then the Deuill giue him good of it:
10 2763 Ile stay no longer question
10 2764 
10 2765    Por. Tarry Iew,
10 2766 The Law hath yet another hold on you.
10 2767 It is enacted in the Lawes of Venice,
10 2768 If it be proued against an Alien,
10 2769 That by direct, or indirect attempts
10 2770 He seeke the life of any Citizen,
10 2771 The party gainst the which he doth contriue,
10 2772 Shall seaze one halfe his goods, the other halfe
10 2773 Comes to the priuie coffer of the State,
10 2774 And the offenders life lies in the mercy
10 2775 Of the Duke onely, gainst all other voice.
10 2776 In which predicament I say thou standst:
10 2777 For it appeares by manifest proceeding,
10 2778 That indirectly, and directly to,
10 2779 Thou hast contriu'd against the very life
10 2780 Of the defendant: and thou hast incur'd
10 2781 The danger formerly by me rehearst.
10 2782 Downe therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke
10 2783 
10 2784    Gra. Beg that thou maist haue leaue to hang thy selfe,
10 2785 And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
10 2786 Thou hast not left the value of a cord,
10 2787 Therefore thou must be hang'd at the states charge
10 2788 
10 2789    Duk. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,
10 2790 I pardon thee thy life before thou aske it:
10 2791 For halfe thy wealth, it is Anthonio's
10 2792 The other halfe comes to the generall state,
10 2793 Which humblenesse may driue vnto a fine
10 2794 
10 2795    Por. I for the state, not for Anthonio
10 2796 
10 2797    Shy. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that,
10 2798 You take my house, when you do take the prop
10 2799 That doth sustaine my house: you take my life
10 2800 When you doe take the meanes whereby I liue
10 2801 
10 2802    Por. What mercy can you render him Anthonio?
10 2803   Gra. A halter gratis, nothing else for Gods sake
10 2804 
10 2805    Ant. So please my Lord the Duke, and all the Court
10 2806 To quit the fine for one halfe of his goods,
10 2807 I am content: so he will let me haue
10 2808 The other halfe in vse, to render it
10 2809 Vpon his death, vnto the Gentleman
10 2810 That lately stole his daughter.
10 2811 Two things prouided more, that for this fauour
10 2812 He presently become a Christian:
10 2813 The other, that he doe record a gift
10 2814 Heere in the Court of all he dies possest
10 2815 Vnto his sonne Lorenzo, and his daughter
10 2816 
10 2817    Duk. He shall doe this, or else I doe recant
10 2818 The pardon that I late pronounced heere
10 2819 
10 2820    Por. Art thou contented Iew? what dost thou say?
10 2821   Shy. I am content
10 2822 
10 2823    Por. Clarke, draw a deed of gift
10 2824 
10 2825    Shy. I pray you giue me leaue to goe from hence,
10 2826 I am not well, send the deed after me,
10 2827 And I will signe it
10 2828 
10 2829    Duke. Get thee gone, but doe it
10 2830 
10 2831    Gra. In christning thou shalt haue two godfathers,
10 2832 Had I been iudge, thou shouldst haue had ten more,
10 2833 To bring thee to the gallowes, not to the font.
10 2834 Enter.
10 2835 
10 2836   Du. Sir I intreat you with me home to dinner
10 2837 
10 2838    Por. I humbly doe desire your Grace of pardon,
10 2839 I must away this night toward Padua,
10 2840 And it is meete I presently set forth
10 2841 
10 2842    Duk. I am sorry that your leysure serues you not:
10 2843 Anthonio, gratifie this gentleman,
10 2844 For in my minde you are much bound to him.
10 2845 
10 2846 Exit Duke and his traine.
10 2847 
10 2848   Bass. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
10 2849 Haue by your wisedome beene this day acquitted
10 2850 Of greeuous penalties, in lieu whereof,
10 2851 Three thousand Ducats due vnto the Iew
10 2852 We freely cope your curteous paines withall
10 2853 
10 2854    An. And stand indebted ouer and aboue
10 2855 In loue and seruice to you euermore
10 2856 
10 2857    Por. He is well paid that is well satisfied,
10 2858 And I deliuering you, am satisfied,
10 2859 And therein doe account my selfe well paid,
10 2860 My minde was neuer yet more mercinarie.
10 2861 I pray you know me when we meete againe,
10 2862 I wish you well, and so I take my leaue
10 2863 
10 2864    Bass. Deare sir, of force I must attempt you further,
10 2865 Take some remembrance of vs as a tribute,
10 2866 Not as fee: grant me two things, I pray you
10 2867 Not to denie me, and to pardon me
10 2868 
10 2869    Por. You presse mee farre, and therefore I will yeeld,
10 2870 Giue me your gloues, Ile weare them for your sake,
10 2871 And for your loue Ile take this ring from you,
10 2872 Doe not draw backe your hand, ile take no more,
10 2873 And you in loue shall not deny me this?
10 2874   Bass. This ring good sir, alas it is a trifle,
10 2875 I will not shame my selfe to giue you this
10 2876 
10 2877    Por. I wil haue nothing else but onely this,
10 2878 And now methinkes I haue a minde to it
10 2879 
10 2880    Bas. There's more depends on this then on the valew,
10 2881 The dearest ring in Venice will I giue you,
10 2882 And finde it out by proclamation,
10 2883 Onely for this I pray you pardon me
10 2884 
10 2885    Por. I see sir you are liberall in offers,
10 2886 You taught me first to beg, and now me thinkes
10 2887 You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd
10 2888 
10 2889    Bas. Good sir, this ring was giuen me by my wife,
10 2890 And when she put it on, she made me vow
10 2891 That I should neither sell, nor giue, nor lose it
10 2892 
10 2893    Por. That scuse serues many men to saue their gifts,
10 2894 And if your wife be not a mad woman,
10 2895 And know how well I haue deseru'd this ring,
10 2896 Shee would not hold out enemy for euer
10 2897 For giuing it to me: well, peace be with you.
10 2898 
10 2899 Exeunt.
10 2900 
10 2901   Ant. My L[ord]. Bassanio, let him haue the ring,
10 2902 Let his deseruings and my loue withall
10 2903 Be valued against your wiues commandement
10 2904 
10 2905    Bass. Goe Gratiano, run and ouer-take him,
10 2906 Giue him the ring, and bring him if thou canst
10 2907 Vnto Anthonios house, away, make haste.
10 2908 
10 2909 Exit Grati.
10 2910 
10 2911 Come, you and I will thither presently,
10 2912 And in the morning early will we both
10 2913 Flie toward Belmont, come Anthonio.
10 2914 
10 2915 Exeunt.
10 2916 
10 2917 Enter Portia and Nerrissa.
10 2918 
10 2919   Por. Enquire the Iewes house out, giue him this deed,
10 2920 And let him signe it, wee'll away to night,
10 2921 And be a day before our husbands home:
10 2922 This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
10 2923 Enter Gratiano.
10 2924 
10 2925   Gra. Faire sir, you are well ore-tane:
10 2926 My L[ord]. Bassanio vpon more aduice,
10 2927 Hath sent you heere this ring, and doth intreat
10 2928 Your company at dinner
10 2929 
10 2930    Por. That cannot be;
10 2931 His ring I doe accept most thankfully,
10 2932 And so I pray you tell him: furthermore,
10 2933 I pray you shew my youth old Shylockes house
10 2934 
10 2935    Gra. That will I doe
10 2936 
10 2937    Ner. Sir, I would speake with you:
10 2938 Ile see if I can get my husbands ring
10 2939 Which I did make him sweare to keepe for euer
10 2940 
10 2941    Por. Thou maist I warrant, we shal haue old swearing
10 2942 That they did giue the rings away to men;
10 2943 But weele out-face them, and out-sweare them to:
10 2944 Away, make haste, thou know'st where I will tarry
10 2945 
10 2946    Ner. Come good sir, will you shew me to this house.
10 2947 
10 2948 Exeunt.
10 2949 
10 2950 
10 2951 Actus Quintus.
10 2952 
10 2953 Enter Lorenzo and Iessica.
10 2954 
10 2955   Lor. The moone shines bright. In such a night as this,
10 2956 When the sweet winde did gently kisse the trees,
10 2957 And they did make no noyse, in such a night
10 2958 Troylus me thinkes mounted the Troian walls,
10 2959 And sigh'd his soule toward the Grecian tents
10 2960 Where Cressed lay that night
10 2961 
10 2962    Ies. In such a night
10 2963 Did Thisbie fearefully ore-trip the dewe,
10 2964 And saw the Lyons shadow ere himselfe,
10 2965 And ranne dismayed away
10 2966 
10 2967    Loren. In such a night
10 2968 Stood Dido with a Willow in her hand
10 2969 Vpon the wilde sea bankes, and waft her Loue
10 2970 To come againe to Carthage
10 2971 
10 2972    Ies. In such a night
10 2973 Medea gathered the inchanted hearbs
10 2974 That did renew old Eson
10 2975 
10 2976    Loren. In such a night
10 2977 Did Iessica steale from the wealthy Iewe,
10 2978 And with an Vnthrift Loue did runne from Venice,
10 2979 As farre as Belmont
10 2980 
10 2981    Ies. In such a night
10 2982 Did young Lorenzo sweare he lou'd her well,
10 2983 Stealing her soule with many vowes of faith,
10 2984 And nere a true one
10 2985 
10 2986    Loren. In such a night
10 2987 Did pretty Iessica (like a little shrow)
10 2988 Slander her Loue, and he forgaue it her
10 2989 
10 2990    Iessi. I would out-night you did no body come:
10 2991 But harke, I heare the footing of a man.
10 2992 Enter Messenger.
10 2993 
10 2994   Lor. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
10 2995   Mes. A friend
10 2996 
10 2997    Loren. A friend, what friend? your name I pray you friend?
10 2998   Mes. Stephano is my name, and I bring word
10 2999 My Mistresse will before the breake of day
10 3000 Be heere at Belmont, she doth stray about
10 3001 By holy crosses where she kneeles and prayes
10 3002 For happy wedlocke houres
10 3003 
10 3004    Loren. Who comes with her?
10 3005   Mes. None but a holy Hermit and her maid:
10 3006 I pray you is my Master yet return'd?
10 3007   Loren. He is not, nor we haue not heard from him,
10 3008 But goe we in I pray thee Iessica,
10 3009 And ceremoniously let vs prepare
10 3010 Some welcome for the Mistresse of the house,
10 3011 Enter Clowne.
10 3012 
10 3013   Clo. Sola, sola: wo ha ho, sola, sola
10 3014 
10 3015    Loren. Who calls?
10 3016   Clo. Sola, did you see M[aster]. Lorenzo, & M[aster]. Lorenzo,
10 3017 sola,
10 3018   Lor. Leaue hollowing man, heere
10 3019 
10 3020    Clo. Sola, where, where?
10 3021   Lor. Heere?
10 3022   Clo. Tel him ther's a Post come from my Master, with
10 3023 his horne full of good newes, my Master will be here ere
10 3024 morning sweete soule
10 3025 
10 3026    Loren. Let's in, and there expect their comming.
10 3027 And yet no matter: why should we goe in?
10 3028 My friend Stephen, signifie pray you
10 3029 Within the house, your Mistresse is at hand,
10 3030 And bring your musique foorth into the ayre.
10 3031 How sweet the moone-light sleepes vpon this banke,
10 3032 Heere will we sit, and let the sounds of musicke
10 3033 Creepe in our eares soft stilnes, and the night
10 3034 Become the tutches of sweet harmonie:
10 3035 Sit Iessica, looke how the floore of heauen
10 3036 Is thicke inlayed with pattens of bright gold,
10 3037 There's not the smallest orbe which thou beholdst
10 3038 But in his motion like an Angell sings,
10 3039 Still quiring to the young eyed Cherubins;
10 3040 Such harmonie is in immortall soules,
10 3041 But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
10 3042 Doth grosly close in it, we cannot heare it:
10 3043 Come hoe, and wake Diana with a hymne,
10 3044 With sweetest tutches pearce your Mistresse eare,
10 3045 And draw her home with musicke
10 3046 
10 3047    Iessi. I am neuer merry when I heare sweet musique.
10 3048 
10 3049 Play musicke.
10 3050 
10 3051   Lor. The reason is, your spirits are attentiue:
10 3052 For doe but note a wilde and wanton heard
10 3053 Or race of youthful and vnhandled colts,
10 3054 Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
10 3055 Which is the hot condition of their bloud,
10 3056 If they but heare perchance a trumpet sound,
10 3057 Or any ayre of musicke touch their eares,
10 3058 You shall perceiue them make a mutuall stand,
10 3059 Their sauage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze,
10 3060 By the sweet power of musicke: therefore the Poet
10 3061 Did faine that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods.
10 3062 Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
10 3063 But musicke for time doth change his nature,
10 3064 The man that hath no musicke in himselfe,
10 3065 Nor is not moued with concord of sweet sounds,
10 3066 Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoyles,
10 3067 The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
10 3068 And his affections darke as Erobus,
10 3069 Let no such man be trusted: marke the musicke.
10 3070 Enter Portia and Nerrissa.
10 3071 
10 3072   Por. That light we see is burning in my hall:
10 3073 How farre that little candell throwes his beames,
10 3074 So shines a good deed in a naughty world
10 3075 
10 3076    Ner. When the moone shone we did not see the candle?
10 3077   Por. So doth the greater glory dim the lesse,
10 3078 A substitute shines brightly as a King
10 3079 Vntill a King be by, and then his state
10 3080 Empties it selfe, as doth an inland brooke
10 3081 Into the maine of waters: musique, harke.
10 3082 
10 3083 Musicke.
10 3084 
10 3085   Ner. It is your musicke Madame of the house
10 3086 
10 3087    Por. Nothing is good I see without respect,
10 3088 Methinkes it sounds much sweeter then by day?
10 3089   Ner. Silence bestowes that vertue on it Madam
10 3090 
10 3091    Por. The Crow doth sing as sweetly as the Larke
10 3092 When neither is attended: and I thinke
10 3093 The Nightingale if she should sing by day
10 3094 When euery Goose is cackling, would be thought
10 3095 No better a Musitian then the Wren?
10 3096 How many things by season, season'd are
10 3097 To their right praise, and true perfection:
10 3098 Peace, how the Moone sleepes with Endimion,
10 3099 And would not be awak'd.
10 3100 
10 3101 Musicke ceases.
10 3102 
10 3103   Lor. That is the voice,
10 3104 Or I am much deceiu'd of Portia
10 3105 
10 3106    Por. He knowes me as the blinde man knowes the
10 3107 Cuckow by the bad voice?
10 3108   Lor. Deere Lady welcome home?
10 3109   Por. We haue bene praying for our husbands welfare
10 3110 Which speed we hope the better for our words,
10 3111 Are they return'd?
10 3112   Lor. Madam, they are not yet:
10 3113 But there is come a Messenger before
10 3114 To signifie their comming
10 3115 
10 3116    Por. Go in Nerrissa,
10 3117 Giue order to my seruants, that they take
10 3118 No note at all of our being absent hence,
10 3119 Nor you Lorenzo, Iessica nor you.
10 3120 
10 3121 A Tucket sounds.
10 3122 
10 3123   Lor. Your husband is at hand, I heare his Trumpet,
10 3124 We are no tell-tales Madam, feare you not
10 3125 
10 3126    Por. This night methinkes is but the daylight sicke,
10 3127 It lookes a little paler, 'tis a day,
10 3128 Such as the day is, when the Sun is hid.
10 3129 Enter Bassanio, Anthonio, Gratiano, and their Followers.
10 3130 
10 3131   Bas. We should hold day with the Antipodes,
10 3132 If you would walke in absence of the sunne
10 3133 
10 3134    Por. Let me giue light, but let me not be light,
10 3135 For a light wife doth make a heauie husband,
10 3136 And neuer be Bassanio so for me,
10 3137 But God sort all: you are welcome home my Lord
10 3138 
10 3139    Bass. I thanke you Madam, giue welcom to my friend
10 3140 This is the man, this is Anthonio,
10 3141 To whom I am so infinitely bound
10 3142 
10 3143    Por. You should in all sence be much bound to him,
10 3144 For as I heare he was much bound for you
10 3145 
10 3146    Anth. No more then I am wel acquitted of
10 3147 
10 3148    Por. Sir, you are verie welcome to our house:
10 3149 It must appeare in other waies then words,
10 3150 Therefore I scant this breathing curtesie
10 3151 
10 3152    Gra. By yonder Moone I sweare you do me wrong,
10 3153 Infaith I gaue it to the Iudges Clearke,
10 3154 Would he were gelt that had it for my part,
10 3155 Since you do take it Loue so much at hart
10 3156 
10 3157    Por. A quarrel hoe alreadie, what's the matter?
10 3158   Gra. About a hoope of Gold, a paltry Ring
10 3159 That she did giue me, whose Poesie was
10 3160 For all the world like Cutlers Poetry
10 3161 Vpon a knife; Loue mee, and leaue mee not
10 3162 
10 3163    Ner. What talke you of the Poesie or the valew:
10 3164 You swore to me when I did giue it you,
10 3165 That you would weare it til the houre of death,
10 3166 And that it should lye with you in your graue,
10 3167 Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
10 3168 You should haue beene respectiue and haue kept it.
10 3169 Gaue it a Iudges Clearke: but wel I know
10 3170 The Clearke wil nere weare haire on's face that had it
10 3171 
10 3172    Gra. He wil, and if he liue to be a man
10 3173 
10 3174    Nerrissa. I, if a Woman liue to be a man
10 3175 
10 3176    Gra. Now by this hand I gaue it to a youth,
10 3177 A kinde of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
10 3178 No higher then thy selfe, the Iudges Clearke,
10 3179 A prating boy that begg'd it as a Fee,
10 3180 I could not for my heart deny it him
10 3181 
10 3182    Por. You were too blame, I must be plaine with you,
10 3183 To part so slightly with your wiues first gift,
10 3184 A thing stucke on with oathes vpon your finger,
10 3185 And so riueted with faith vnto your flesh.
10 3186 I gaue my Loue a Ring, and made him sweare
10 3187 Neuer to part with it, and heere he stands:
10 3188 I dare be sworne for him, he would not leaue it,
10 3189 Nor plucke it from his finger, for the wealth
10 3190 That the world masters. Now in faith Gratiano,
10 3191 You giue your wife too vnkinde a cause of greefe,
10 3192 And 'twere to me I should be mad at it
10 3193 
10 3194    Bass. Why I were best to cut my left hand off,
10 3195 And sweare I lost the Ring defending it
10 3196 
10 3197    Gra. My Lord Bassanio gaue his Ring away
10 3198 Vnto the Iudge that beg'd it, and indeede
10 3199 Deseru'd it too: and then the Boy his Clearke
10 3200 That tooke some paines in writing, he begg'd mine,
10 3201 And neyther man nor master would take ought
10 3202 But the two Rings
10 3203 
10 3204    Por. What Ring gaue you my Lord?
10 3205 Not that I hope which you receiu'd of me
10 3206 
10 3207    Bass. If I could adde a lie vnto a fault,
10 3208 I would deny it: but you see my finger
10 3209 Hath not the Ring vpon it, it is gone
10 3210 
10 3211    Por. Euen so voide is your false heart of truth.
10 3212 By heauen I wil nere come in your bed
10 3213 Vntil I see the Ring
10 3214 
10 3215    Ner. Nor I in yours, til I againe see mine
10 3216 
10 3217    Bass. Sweet Portia,
10 3218 If you did know to whom I gaue the Ring,
10 3219 If you did know for whom I gaue the Ring,
10 3220 And would conceiue for what I gaue the Ring,
10 3221 And how vnwillingly I left the Ring,
10 3222 When nought would be accepted but the Ring,
10 3223 You would abate the strength of your displeasure?
10 3224   Por. If you had knowne the vertue of the Ring,
10 3225 Or halfe her worthinesse that gaue the Ring,
10 3226 Or your owne honour to containe the Ring,
10 3227 You would not then haue parted with the Ring:
10 3228 What man is there so much vnreasonable,
10 3229 If you had pleas'd to haue defended it
10 3230 With any termes of Zeale: wanted the modestie
10 3231 To vrge the thing held as a ceremonie:
10 3232 Nerrissa teaches me what to beleeue,
10 3233 Ile die for't, but some Woman had the Ring?
10 3234   Bass. No by mine honor Madam, by my soule
10 3235 No Woman had it, but a ciuill Doctor,
10 3236 Which did refuse three thousand Ducates of me,
10 3237 And beg'd the Ring; the which I did denie him,
10 3238 And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away:
10 3239 Euen he that had held vp the verie life
10 3240 Of my deere friend. What should I say sweete Lady?
10 3241 I was inforc'd to send it after him,
10 3242 I was beset with shame and curtesie,
10 3243 My honor would not let ingratitude
10 3244 So much besmeare it. Pardon me good Lady,
10 3245 And by these blessed Candles of the night,
10 3246 Had you bene there, I thinke you would haue beg'd
10 3247 The Ring of me, to giue the worthie Doctor?
10 3248   Por. Let not that Doctor ere come neere my house,
10 3249 Since he hath got the iewell that I loued,
10 3250 And that which you did sweare to keepe for me,
10 3251 I will become as liberall as you,
10 3252 Ile not deny him any thing I haue,
10 3253 No, not my body, nor my husbands bed:
10 3254 Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
10 3255 Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argos,
10 3256 If you doe not, if I be left alone,
10 3257 Now by mine honour which is yet mine owne,
10 3258 Ile haue the Doctor for my bedfellow
10 3259 
10 3260    Nerrissa. And I his Clarke: therefore be well aduis'd
10 3261 How you doe leaue me to mine owne protection
10 3262 
10 3263    Gra. Well, doe you so: let not me take him then,
10 3264 For if I doe, ile mar the yong Clarks pen
10 3265 
10 3266    Ant. I am th' vnhappy subiect of these quarrels
10 3267 
10 3268    Por. Sir, grieue not you,
10 3269 You are welcome notwithstanding
10 3270 
10 3271    Bas. Portia, forgiue me this enforced wrong,
10 3272 And in the hearing of these manie friends
10 3273 I sweare to thee, euen by thine owne faire eyes
10 3274 Wherein I see my selfe
10 3275 
10 3276    Por. Marke you but that?
10 3277 In both my eyes he doubly sees himselfe:
10 3278 In each eye one, sweare by your double selfe,
10 3279 And there's an oath of credit
10 3280 
10 3281    Bas. Nay, but heare me.
10 3282 Pardon this fault, and by my soule I sweare
10 3283 I neuer more will breake an oath with thee
10 3284 
10 3285    Anth. I once did lend my bodie for thy wealth,
10 3286 Which but for him that had your husbands ring
10 3287 Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound againe,
10 3288 My soule vpon the forfeit, that your Lord
10 3289 Will neuer more breake faith aduisedlie
10 3290 
10 3291    Por. Then you shall be his suretie: giue him this,
10 3292 And bid him keepe it better then the other
10 3293 
10 3294    Ant. Heere Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring
10 3295 
10 3296    Bass. By heauen it is the same I gaue the Doctor
10 3297 
10 3298    Por. I had it of him: pardon Bassanio,
10 3299 For by this ring the Doctor lay with me
10 3300 
10 3301    Ner. And pardon me my gentle Gratiano,
10 3302 For that same scrubbed boy the Doctors Clarke
10 3303 In liew of this, last night did lye with me
10 3304 
10 3305    Gra. Why this is like the mending of high waies
10 3306 In Sommer, where the waies are faire enough:
10 3307 What, are we Cuckolds ere we haue deseru'd it
10 3308 
10 3309    Por. Speake not so grossely, you are all amaz'd;
10 3310 Heere is a letter, reade it at your leysure,
10 3311 It comes from Padua from Bellario,
10 3312 There you shall finde that Portia was the Doctor,
10 3313 Nerrissa there her Clarke. Lorenzo heere
10 3314 Shall witnesse I set forth as soone as you,
10 3315 And but eu'n now return'd: I haue not yet
10 3316 Entred my house. Anthonio you are welcome,
10 3317 And I haue better newes in store for you
10 3318 Then you expect: vnseale this letter soone,
10 3319 There you shall finde three of your Argosies
10 3320 Are richly come to harbour sodainlie.
10 3321 You shall not know by what strange accident
10 3322 I chanced on this letter
10 3323 
10 3324    Antho. I am dumbe
10 3325 
10 3326    Bass. Were you the Doctor, and I knew you not?
10 3327   Gra. Were you the Clark that is to make me cuckold
10 3328 
10 3329    Ner. I, but the Clark that neuer meanes to doe it,
10 3330 Vnlesse he liue vntill he be a man
10 3331 
10 3332    Bass. (Sweet Doctor) you shall be my bedfellow,
10 3333 When I am absent, then lie with my wife
10 3334 
10 3335    An. (Sweet Ladie) you haue giuen me life & liuing;
10 3336 For heere I reade for certaine that my ships
10 3337 Are safelie come to Rode
10 3338 
10 3339    Por. How now Lorenzo?
10 3340 My Clarke hath some good comforts to for you
10 3341 
10 3342    Ner. I, and Ile giue them him without a fee.
10 3343 There doe I giue to you and Iessica
10 3344 From the rich Iewe, a speciall deed of gift
10 3345 After his death, of all he dies possess'd of
10 3346 
10 3347    Loren. Faire Ladies you drop Manna in the way
10 3348 Of starued people
10 3349 
10 3350    Por. It is almost morning,
10 3351 And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
10 3352 Of these euents at full. Let vs goe in,
10 3353 And charge vs there vpon intergatories,
10 3354 And we will answer all things faithfully
10 3355 
10 3356    Gra. Let it be so, the first intergatory
10 3357 That my Nerrissa shall be sworne on, is,
10 3358 Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
10 3359 Or goe to bed, now being two houres to day,
10 3360 But were the day come, I should wish it darke,
10 3361 Till I were couching with the Doctors Clarke.
10 3362 Well, while I liue, Ile feare no other thing
10 3363 So sore, as keeping safe Nerrissas ring.
10 3364 
10 3365 Exeunt.
10 3366 
10 3367 FINIS. The Merchant of Venice.
