5 1 
5 2 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
5 3 
5 4 Enter Rodorigo, and Iago.
5 5 
5 6   Rodorigo. Neuer tell me, I take it much vnkindly
5 7 That thou (Iago) who hast had my purse,
5 8 As if y strings were thine, should'st know of this
5 9 
5 10    Ia. But you'l not heare me. If euer I did dream
5 11 Of such a matter, abhorre me
5 12 
5 13    Rodo. Thou told'st me,
5 14 Thou did'st hold him in thy hate
5 15 
5 16    Iago. Despise me
5 17 If I do not. Three Great-ones of the Cittie,
5 18 (In personall suite to make me his Lieutenant)
5 19 Off-capt to him: and by the faith of man
5 20 I know my price, I am worth no worsse a place.
5 21 But he (as louing his owne pride, and purposes)
5 22 Euades them, with a bumbast Circumstance,
5 23 Horribly stufft with Epithites of warre,
5 24 Non-suites my Mediators. For certes, saies he,
5 25 I haue already chose my Officer. And what was he?
5 26 For-sooth, a great Arithmatician,
5 27 One Michaell Cassio, a Florentine,
5 28 (A Fellow almost damn'd in a faire Wife)
5 29 That neuer set a Squadron in the Field,
5 30 Nor the deuision of a Battaile knowes
5 31 More then a Spinster. Vnlesse the Bookish Theoricke:
5 32 Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose
5 33 As Masterly as he. Meere pratle (without practise)
5 34 Is all his Souldiership. But he (Sir) had th' election;
5 35 And I (of whom his eies had seene the proofe
5 36 At Rhodes, at Ciprus, and on others grounds
5 37 Christen'd, and Heathen) must be be-leed, and calm'd
5 38 By Debitor, and Creditor. This Counter-caster,
5 39 He (in good time) must his Lieutenant be,
5 40 And I (blesse the marke) his Mooreships Auntient
5 41 
5 42    Rod. By heauen, I rather would haue bin his hangman
5 43 
5 44    Iago. Why, there's no remedie.
5 45 'Tis the cursse of Seruice;
5 46 Preferment goes by Letter, and affection,
5 47 And not by old gradation, where each second
5 48 Stood Heire to'th' first. Now Sir, be iudge your selfe,
5 49 Whether I in any iust terme am Affin'd
5 50 To loue the Moore?
5 51   Rod. I would not follow him then
5 52 
5 53    Iago. O Sir content you.
5 54 I follow him, to serue my turne vpon him.
5 55 We cannot all be Masters, nor all Masters
5 56 Cannot be truely follow'd. You shall marke
5 57 Many a dutious and knee-crooking knaue;
5 58 That (doting on his owne obsequious bondage)
5 59 Weares out his time, much like his Masters Asse,
5 60 For naught but Prouender, & when he's old Casheer'd.
5 61 Whip me such honest knaues. Others there are
5 62 Who trym'd in Formes, and visages of Dutie,
5 63 Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues,
5 64 And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords
5 65 Doe well thriue by them.
5 66 And when they haue lin'd their Coates
5 67 Doe themselues Homage.
5 68 These Fellowes haue some soule,
5 69 And such a one do I professe my selfe. For (Sir)
5 70 It is as sure as you are Rodorigo,
5 71 Were I the Moore, I would not be Iago:
5 72 In following him, I follow but my selfe.
5 73 Heauen is my Iudge, not I for loue and dutie,
5 74 But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
5 75 For when my outward Action doth demonstrate
5 76 The natiue act, and figure of my heart
5 77 In Complement externe, 'tis not long after
5 78 But I will weare my heart vpon my sleeue
5 79 For Dawes to pecke at; I am not what I am
5 80 
5 81    Rod. What a fall Fortune do's the Thicks-lips owe
5 82 If he can carry't thus?
5 83   Iago. Call vp her Father:
5 84 Rowse him, make after him, poyson his delight,
5 85 Proclaime him in the Streets. Incense her kinsmen,
5 86 And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell,
5 87 Plague him with Flies: though that his Ioy be Ioy,
5 88 Yet throw such chances of vexation on't,
5 89 As it may loose some colour
5 90 
5 91    Rodo. Heere is her Fathers house, Ile call aloud
5 92 
5 93    Iago. Doe, with like timerous accent, and dire yell,
5 94 As when (by Night and Negligence) the Fire
5 95 Is spied in populus Citties
5 96 
5 97    Rodo. What hoa: Brabantio, Signior Brabantio, hoa
5 98 
5 99    Iago. Awake: what hoa, Brabantio: Theeues, Theeues.
5 100 Looke to your house, your daughter, and your Bags,
5 101 Theeues, Theeues
5 102 
5 103    Bra. Aboue. What is the reason of this terrible
5 104 Summons? What is the matter there?
5 105   Rodo. Signior is all your Familie within?
5 106   Iago. Are your Doores lock'd?
5 107   Bra. Why? Wherefore ask you this?
5 108   Iago. Sir, y'are rob'd, for shame put on your Gowne,
5 109 Your heart is burst, you haue lost halfe your soule
5 110 Euen now, now, very now, an old blacke Ram
5 111 Is tupping your white Ewe. Arise, arise,
5 112 Awake the snorting Cittizens with the Bell,
5 113 Or else the deuill will make a Grand-sire of you.
5 114 Arise I say
5 115 
5 116    Bra. What, haue you lost your wits?
5 117   Rod. Most reuerend Signior, do you know my voice?
5 118   Bra. Not I: what are you?
5 119   Rod. My name is Rodorigo
5 120 
5 121    Bra. The worsser welcome:
5 122 I haue charg'd thee not to haunt about my doores:
5 123 In honest plainenesse thou hast heard me say,
5 124 My Daughter is not for thee. And now in madnesse
5 125 (Being full of Supper, and distempring draughtes)
5 126 Vpon malitious knauerie, dost thou come
5 127 To start my quiet
5 128 
5 129    Rod. Sir, Sir, Sir
5 130 
5 131    Bra. But thou must needs be sure,
5 132 My spirits and my place haue in their power
5 133 To make this bitter to thee
5 134 
5 135    Rodo. Patience good Sir
5 136 
5 137    Bra. What tell'st thou me of Robbing?
5 138 This is Venice: my house is not a Grange
5 139 
5 140    Rodo. Most graue Brabantio,
5 141 In simple and pure soule, I come to you
5 142 
5 143    Ia. Sir: you are one of those that will not serue God,
5 144 if the deuill bid you. Because we come to do you seruice,
5 145 and you thinke we are Ruffians, you'le haue your Daughter
5 146 couer'd with a Barbary horse, you'le haue your Nephewes
5 147 neigh to you, you'le haue Coursers for Cozens:
5 148 and Gennets for Germaines
5 149 
5 150    Bra. What prophane wretch art thou?
5 151   Ia. I am one Sir, that comes to tell you, your Daughter
5 152 and the Moore, are making the Beast with two backs
5 153 
5 154    Bra. Thou art a Villaine
5 155 
5 156    Iago. You are a Senator
5 157 
5 158    Bra. This thou shalt answere. I know thee Rodorigo
5 159 
5 160    Rod. Sir, I will answere any thing. But I beseech you
5 161 If't be your pleasure, and most wise consent,
5 162 (As partly I find it is) that your faire Daughter,
5 163 At this odde Euen and dull watch o'th' night
5 164 Transported with no worse nor better guard,
5 165 But with a knaue of common hire, a Gundelier,
5 166 To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore:
5 167 If this be knowne to you, and your Allowance,
5 168 We then haue done you bold, and saucie wrongs.
5 169 But if you know not this, my Manners tell me,
5 170 We haue your wrong rebuke. Do not beleeue
5 171 That from the sence of all Ciuilitie,
5 172 I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence.
5 173 Your Daughter (if you haue not giuen her leaue)
5 174 I say againe, hath made a grosse reuolt,
5 175 Tying her Dutie, Beautie, Wit, and Fortunes
5 176 In an extrauagant, and wheeling Stranger,
5 177 Of here, and euery where: straight satisfie your selfe.
5 178 If she be in her Chamber, or your house,
5 179 Let loose on me the Iustice of the State
5 180 For thus deluding you
5 181 
5 182    Bra. Strike on the Tinder, hoa:
5 183 Giue me a Taper: call vp all my people,
5 184 This Accident is not vnlike my dreame,
5 185 Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie.
5 186 Light, I say, light.
5 187 Enter.
5 188 
5 189   Iag. Farewell: for I must leaue you.
5 190 It seemes not meete, nor wholesome to my place
5 191 To be producted, (as if I stay, I shall,)
5 192 Against the Moore. For I do know the State,
5 193 (How euer this may gall him with some checke)
5 194 Cannot with safetie cast-him. For he's embark'd
5 195 With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres,
5 196 (Which euen now stands in Act) that for their soules
5 197 Another of his Fadome, they haue none,
5 198 To lead their Businesse. In which regard,
5 199 Though I do hate him as I do hell paines,
5 200 Yet, for necessitie of present life,
5 201 I must show out a Flag, and signe of Loue,
5 202 (Which is indeed but signe) that you shal surely find him
5 203 Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search:
5 204 And there will I be with him. So farewell.
5 205 
5 206 Enter.
5 207 
5 208 Enter Brabantio, with Seruants and Torches.
5 209 
5 210   Bra. It is too true an euill. Gone she is,
5 211 And what's to come of my despised time,
5 212 Is naught but bitternesse. Now Rodorigo,
5 213 Where didst thou see her? (Oh vnhappie Girle)
5 214 With the Moore saist thou? (Who would be a Father?)
5 215 How didst thou know 'twas she? (Oh she deceaues me
5 216 Past thought:) what said she to you? Get moe Tapers.
5 217 Raise all my Kindred. Are they married thinke you?
5 218   Rodo. Truely I thinke they are
5 219 
5 220    Bra. Oh Heauen: how got she out?
5 221 Oh treason of the blood.
5 222 Fathers, from hence trust not your Daughters minds
5 223 By what you see them act. Is there not Charmes,
5 224 By which the propertie of Youth, and Maidhood
5 225 May be abus'd? Haue you not read Rodorigo,
5 226 Of some such thing?
5 227   Rod. Yes Sir: I haue indeed
5 228 
5 229    Bra. Call vp my Brother: oh would you had had her.
5 230 Some one way, some another. Doe you know
5 231 Where we may apprehend her, and the Moore?
5 232   Rod. I thinke I can discouer him, if you please
5 233 To get good Guard, and go along with me
5 234 
5 235    Bra. Pray you lead on. At euery house Ile call,
5 236 (I may command at most) get Weapons (hoa)
5 237 And raise some speciall Officers of might:
5 238 On good Rodorigo, I will deserue your paines.
5 239 
5 240 Exeunt.
5 241 
5 242 
5 243 Scena Secunda.
5 244 
5 245 Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants, with Torches.
5 246 
5 247   Ia. Though in the trade of Warre I haue slaine men,
5 248 Yet do I hold it very stuffe o'th' conscience
5 249 To do no contriu'd Murder: I lacke Iniquitie
5 250 Sometime to do me seruice. Nine, or ten times
5 251 I had thought t'haue yerk'd him here vnder the Ribbes
5 252 
5 253    Othello. 'Tis better as it is
5 254 
5 255    Iago. Nay but he prated,
5 256 And spoke such scuruy, and prouoking termes
5 257 Against your Honor, that with the little godlinesse I haue
5 258 I did full hard forbeare him. But I pray you Sir,
5 259 Are you fast married? Be assur'd of this,
5 260 That the Magnifico is much belou'd,
5 261 And hath in his effect a voice potentiall
5 262 As double as the Dukes: He will diuorce you.
5 263 Or put vpon you, what restraint or greeuance,
5 264 The Law (with all his might, to enforce it on)
5 265 Will giue him Cable
5 266 
5 267    Othel. Let him do his spight;
5 268 My Seruices, which I haue done the Signorie
5 269 Shall out-tongue his Complaints. 'Tis yet to know,
5 270 Which when I know, that boasting is an Honour,
5 271 I shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being,
5 272 From Men of Royall Seige. And my demerites
5 273 May speake (vnbonnetted) to as proud a Fortune
5 274 As this that I haue reach'd. For know Iago,
5 275 But that I loue the gentle Desdemona,
5 276 I would not my vnhoused free condition
5 277 Put into Circumscription, and Confine,
5 278 For the Seas worth. But looke, what Lights come yond?
5 279 
5 280 Enter Cassio, with Torches.
5 281 
5 282   Iago. Those are the raised Father, and his Friends:
5 283 You were best go in
5 284 
5 285    Othel. Not I: I must be found.
5 286 My Parts, my Title, and my perfect Soule
5 287 Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
5 288   Iago. By Ianus, I thinke no
5 289 
5 290    Othel. The Seruants of the Dukes?
5 291 And my Lieutenant?
5 292 The goodnesse of the Night vpon you (Friends)
5 293 What is the Newes?
5 294   Cassio. The Duke do's greet you (Generall)
5 295 And he requires your haste, Post-haste appearance,
5 296 Euen on the instant
5 297 
5 298    Othello. What is the matter, thinke you?
5 299   Cassio. Something from Cyprus, as I may diuine:
5 300 It is a businesse of some heate. The Gallies
5 301 Haue sent a dozen sequent Messengers
5 302 This very night, at one anothers heeles:
5 303 And many of the Consuls, rais'd and met,
5 304 Are at the Dukes already. You haue bin hotly call'd for,
5 305 When being not at your Lodging to be found,
5 306 The Senate hath sent about three seuerall Quests,
5 307 To search you out
5 308 
5 309    Othel. 'Tis well I am found by you:
5 310 I will but spend a word here in the house,
5 311 And goe with you
5 312 
5 313    Cassio. Aunciant, what makes he heere?
5 314   Iago. Faith, he to night hath boarded a Land Carract,
5 315 If it proue lawfull prize, he's made for euer
5 316 
5 317    Cassio. I do not vnderstand
5 318 
5 319    Iago. He's married
5 320 
5 321    Cassio. To who?
5 322   Iago. Marry to- Come Captaine, will you go?
5 323   Othel. Haue with you
5 324 
5 325    Cassio. Here comes another Troope to seeke for you.
5 326 
5 327 Enter Brabantio, Rodorigo, with Officers, and Torches.
5 328 
5 329   Iago. It is Brabantio: Generall be aduis'd,
5 330 He comes to bad intent
5 331 
5 332    Othello. Holla, stand there
5 333 
5 334    Rodo. Signior, it is the Moore
5 335 
5 336    Bra. Downe with him, Theefe
5 337 
5 338    Iago. You, Rodorigo? Come Sir, I am for you
5 339 
5 340    Othe. Keepe vp your bright Swords, for the dew will
5 341 rust them. Good Signior, you shall more command with
5 342 yeares, then with your Weapons
5 343 
5 344    Bra. Oh thou foule Theefe,
5 345 Where hast thou stow'd my Daughter?
5 346 Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchaunted her
5 347 For Ile referre me to all things of sense,
5 348 (If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound)
5 349 Whether a Maid, so tender, Faire, and Happie,
5 350 So opposite to Marriage, that she shun'd
5 351 The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation,
5 352 Would euer haue (t' encurre a generall mocke)
5 353 Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome,
5 354 Of such a thing as thou: to feare, not to delight?
5 355 Iudge me the world, if 'tis not grosse in sense,
5 356 That thou hast practis'd on her with foule Charmes,
5 357 Abus'd her delicate Youth, with Drugs or Minerals,
5 358 That weakens Motion. Ile haue't disputed on,
5 359 'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking;
5 360 I therefore apprehend and do attach thee,
5 361 For an abuser of the World, a practiser
5 362 Of Arts inhibited, and out of warrant;
5 363 Lay hold vpon him, if he do resist
5 364 Subdue him, at his perill
5 365 
5 366    Othe. Hold your hands
5 367 Both you of my inclining, and the rest.
5 368 Were it my Cue to fight, I should haue knowne it
5 369 Without a Prompter. Whether will you that I goe
5 370 To answere this your charge?
5 371   Bra. To Prison, till fit time
5 372 Of Law, and course of direct Session
5 373 Call thee to answer
5 374 
5 375    Othe. What if I do obey?
5 376 How may the Duke be therewith satisfi'd,
5 377 Whose Messengers are heere about my side,
5 378 Vpon some present businesse of the State,
5 379 To bring me to him
5 380 
5 381    Officer. 'Tis true most worthy Signior,
5 382 The Dukes in Counsell, and your Noble selfe,
5 383 I am sure is sent for
5 384 
5 385    Bra. How? The Duke in Counsell?
5 386 In this time of the night? Bring him away;
5 387 Mine's not an idle Cause. The Duke himselfe,
5 388 Or any of my Brothers of the State,
5 389 Cannot but feele this wrong, as 'twere their owne:
5 390 For if such Actions may haue passage free,
5 391 Bond-slaues, and Pagans shall our Statesmen be.
5 392 
5 393 Exeunt.
5 394 
5 395 Scaena Tertia.
5 396 
5 397 Enter Duke, Senators, and Officers.
5 398 
5 399   Duke. There's no composition in this Newes,
5 400 That giues them Credite
5 401 
5 402    1.Sen. Indeed, they are disproportioned;
5 403 My Letters say, a Hundred and seuen Gallies
5 404 
5 405    Duke. And mine a Hundred fortie
5 406 
5 407    2.Sena. And mine two Hundred:
5 408 But though they iumpe not on a iust accompt,
5 409 (As in these Cases where the ayme reports,
5 410 'Tis oft with difference) yet do they all confirme
5 411 A Turkish Fleete, and bearing vp to Cyprus
5 412 
5 413    Duke. Nay, it is possible enough to iudgement:
5 414 I do not so secure me in the Error,
5 415 But the maine Article I do approue
5 416 In fearefull sense
5 417 
5 418    Saylor within. What hoa, what hoa, what hoa.
5 419 
5 420 Enter Saylor.
5 421 
5 422   Officer. A Messenger from the Gallies
5 423 
5 424    Duke. Now? What's the businesse?
5 425   Sailor. The Turkish Preparation makes for Rhodes,
5 426 So was I bid report here to the State,
5 427 By Signior Angelo
5 428 
5 429    Duke. How say you by this change?
5 430   1.Sen. This cannot be
5 431 By no assay of reason. 'Tis a Pageant
5 432 To keepe vs in false gaze, when we consider
5 433 Th' importancie of Cyprus to the Turke;
5 434 And let our selues againe but vnderstand,
5 435 That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes,
5 436 So may he with more facile question beare it,
5 437 For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace,
5 438 But altogether lackes th' abilities
5 439 That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this,
5 440 We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull,
5 441 To leaue that latest, which concernes him first,
5 442 Neglecting an attempt of ease, and gaine
5 443 To wake, and wage a danger profitlesse
5 444 
5 445    Duke. Nay, in all confidence he's not for Rhodes
5 446 
5 447    Officer. Here is more Newes.
5 448 
5 449 Enter a Messenger.
5 450 
5 451   Messen. The Ottamites, Reueren'd, and Gracious,
5 452 Steering with due course toward the Ile of Rhodes,
5 453 Haue there inioynted them with an after Fleete
5 454 
5 455    1.Sen. I, so I thought: how many, as you guesse?
5 456   Mess. Of thirtie Saile: and now they do re-stem
5 457 Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
5 458 Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
5 459 Your trustie and most Valiant Seruitour,
5 460 With his free dutie, recommends you thus,
5 461 And prayes you to beleeue him
5 462 
5 463    Duke. 'Tis certaine then for Cyprus:
5 464 Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne?
5 465   1.Sen. He's now in Florence
5 466 
5 467    Duke. Write from vs,
5 468 To him, Post, Post-haste, dispatch
5 469 
5 470    1.Sen. Here comes Brabantio, and the Valiant Moore.
5 471 
5 472 Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Rodorigo, and Officers.
5 473 
5 474   Duke. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you,
5 475 Against the generall Enemy Ottoman.
5 476 I did not see you: welcome gentle Signior,
5 477 We lack't your Counsaile, and your helpe to night
5 478 
5 479    Bra. So did I yours: Good your Grace pardon me.
5 480 Neither my place, nor ought I heard of businesse
5 481 Hath rais'd me from my bed; nor doth the generall care
5 482 Take hold on me. For my perticular griefe
5 483 Is of so flood-gate, and ore-bearing Nature,
5 484 That it engluts, and swallowes other sorrowes,
5 485 And it is still it selfe
5 486 
5 487    Duke. Why? What's the matter?
5 488   Bra. My Daughter: oh my Daughter!
5 489   Sen. Dead?
5 490   Bra. I, to me.
5 491 She is abus'd, stolne from me, and corrupted
5 492 By Spels, and Medicines, bought of Mountebanks;
5 493 For Nature, so prepostrously to erre,
5 494 (Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,)
5 495 Sans witch-craft could not
5 496 
5 497    Duke. Who ere he be, that in this foule proceeding
5 498 Hath thus beguil'd your Daughter of her selfe,
5 499 And you of her; the bloodie Booke of Law,
5 500 You shall your selfe read, in the bitter letter,
5 501 After your owne sense: yea, though our proper Son
5 502 Stood in your Action
5 503 
5 504    Bra. Humbly I thanke your Grace,
5 505 Here is the man; this Moore, whom now it seemes
5 506 Your speciall Mandate, for the State affaires
5 507 Hath hither brought
5 508 
5 509    All. We are verie sorry for't
5 510 
5 511    Duke. What in your owne part, can you say to this?
5 512   Bra. Nothing, but this is so
5 513 
5 514    Othe. Most Potent, Graue, and Reueren'd Signiors,
5 515 My very Noble, and approu'd good Masters;
5 516 That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter,
5 517 It is most true: true I haue married her;
5 518 The verie head, and front of my offending,
5 519 Hath this extent; no more. Rude am I, in my speech,
5 520 And little bless'd with the soft phrase of Peace;
5 521 For since these Armes of mine, had seuen yeares pith,
5 522 Till now, some nine Moones wasted, they haue vs'd
5 523 Their deerest action, in the Tented Field:
5 524 And little of this great world can I speake,
5 525 More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles, and Battaile,
5 526 And therefore little shall I grace my cause,
5 527 In speaking for my selfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience)
5 528 I will a round vn-varnish'd Tale deliuer,
5 529 Of my whole course of Loue.
5 530 What Drugges, what Charmes,
5 531 What Coniuration, and what mighty Magicke,
5 532 (For such proceeding I am charg'd withall)
5 533 I won his Daughter
5 534 
5 535    Bra. A Maiden, neuer bold:
5 536 Of Spirit so still, and quiet, that her Motion
5 537 Blush'd at her selfe, and she, in spight of Nature,
5 538 Of Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing
5 539 To fall in Loue, with what she fear'd to looke on;
5 540 It is a iudgement main'd, and most imperfect.
5 541 That will confesse Perfection so could erre
5 542 Against all rules of Nature, and must be driuen
5 543 To find out practises of cunning hell
5 544 Why this should be. I therefore vouch againe,
5 545 That with some Mixtures, powrefull o're the blood,
5 546 Or with some Dram, (coniur'd to this effect)
5 547 He wrought vpon her.
5 548 To vouch this, is no proofe,
5 549 Without more wider, and more ouer Test
5 550 Then these thin habits, and poore likely-hoods
5 551 Of moderne seeming, do prefer against him
5 552 
5 553    Sen. But Othello, speake,
5 554 Did you, by indirect, and forced courses
5 555 Subdue, and poyson this yong Maides affections?
5 556 Or came it by request, and such faire question
5 557 As soule, to soule affordeth?
5 558   Othel. I do beseech you,
5 559 Send for the Lady to the Sagitary,
5 560 And let her speake of me before her Father;
5 561 If you do finde me foule, in her report,
5 562 The Trust, the Office, I do hold of you,
5 563 Not onely take away, but let your Sentence
5 564 Euen fall vpon my life
5 565 
5 566    Duke. Fetch Desdemona hither
5 567 
5 568    Othe. Aunciant, conduct them:
5 569 You best know the place.
5 570 And tell she come, as truely as to heauen,
5 571 I do confesse the vices of my blood,
5 572 So iustly to your Graue eares, Ile present
5 573 How I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue,
5 574 And she in mine
5 575 
5 576    Duke. Say it Othello
5 577 
5 578    Othe. Her Father lou'd me, oft inuited me:
5 579 Still question'd me the Storie of my life,
5 580 From yeare to yeare: the Battaile, Sieges, Fortune,
5 581 That I haue past.
5 582 I ran it through, euen from my boyish daies,
5 583 Toth' very moment that he bad me tell it.
5 584 Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:
5 585 Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field,
5 586 Of haire-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach;
5 587 Of being taken by the Insolent Foe,
5 588 And sold to slauery. Of my redemption thence,
5 589 And portance in my Trauellours historie.
5 590 Wherein of Antars vast, and Desarts idle,
5 591 Rough Quarries, Rocks, Hills, whose head touch heauen,
5 592 It was my hint to speake. Such was my Processe,
5 593 And of the Canibals that each others eate,
5 594 The Antropophague, and men whose heads
5 595 Grew beneath their shoulders. These things to heare,
5 596 Would Desdemona seriously incline:
5 597 But still the house Affaires would draw her hence:
5 598 Which euer as she could with haste dispatch,
5 599 She'l'd come againe, and with a greedie eare
5 600 Deuoure vp my discourse. Which I obseruing,
5 601 Tooke once a pliant houre, and found good meanes
5 602 To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,
5 603 That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate,
5 604 Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
5 605 But not instinctiuely: I did consent,
5 606 And often did beguile her of her teares,
5 607 When I did speake of some distressefull stroke
5 608 That my youth suffer'd: My Storie being done,
5 609 She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses:
5 610 She swore in faith 'twas strange: 'twas passing strange,
5 611 'Twas pittifull: 'twas wondrous pittifull.
5 612 She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
5 613 That Heauen had made her such a man. She thank'd me,
5 614 And bad me, if I had a Friend that lou'd her,
5 615 I should but teach him how to tell my Story,
5 616 And that would wooe her. Vpon this hint I spake,
5 617 She lou'd me for the dangers I had past,
5 618 And I lou'd her, that she did pitty them.
5 619 This onely is the witch-craft I haue vs'd.
5 620 Here comes the Ladie: Let her witnesse it.
5 621 
5 622 Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.
5 623 
5 624   Duke. I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too,
5 625 Good Brabantio, take vp this mangled matter at the best:
5 626 Men do their broken Weapons rather vse,
5 627 Then their bare hands
5 628 
5 629    Bra. I pray you heare her speake?
5 630 If she confesse that she was halfe the wooer,
5 631 Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
5 632 Light on the man. Come hither gentle Mistris,
5 633 Do you perceiue in all this Noble Companie,
5 634 Where most you owe obedience?
5 635   Des. My Noble Father,
5 636 I do perceiue heere a diuided dutie.
5 637 To you I am bound for life, and education:
5 638 My life and education both do learne me,
5 639 How to respect you. You are the Lord of duty,
5 640 I am hitherto your Daughter. But heere's my Husband;
5 641 And so much dutie, as my Mother shew'd
5 642 To you, preferring you before her Father:
5 643 So much I challenge, that I may professe
5 644 Due to the Moore my Lord
5 645 
5 646    Bra. God be with you: I haue done.
5 647 Please it your Grace, on to the State Affaires;
5 648 I had rather to adopt a Child, then get it.
5 649 Come hither Moore;
5 650 I here do giue thee that with all my heart,
5 651 Which but thou hast already, with all my heart
5 652 I would keepe from thee. For your sake (Iewell)
5 653 I am glad at soule, I haue no other Child,
5 654 For thy escape would teach me Tirranie
5 655 To hang clogges on them. I haue done my Lord
5 656 
5 657    Duke. Let me speake like your selfe:
5 658 And lay a Sentence,
5 659 Which as a grise, or step may helpe these Louers.
5 660 When remedies are past, the griefes are ended
5 661 By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
5 662 To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon,
5 663 Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on.
5 664 What cannot be preseru'd, when Fortune takes:
5 665 Patience, her Iniury a mock'ry makes.
5 666 The rob'd that smiles, steales something from the Thiefe,
5 667 He robs himselfe, that spends a bootelesse griefe
5 668 
5 669    Bra. So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile,
5 670 We loose it not so long as we can smile:
5 671 He beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares,
5 672 But the free comfort which from thence he heares.
5 673 But he beares both the Sentence, and the sorrow,
5 674 That to pay griefe, must of poore Patience borrow.
5 675 These Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall,
5 676 Being strong on both sides, are Equiuocall.
5 677 But words are words, I neuer yet did heare:
5 678 That the bruized heart was pierc'd through the eares.
5 679 I humbly beseech you proceed to th' Affaires of State
5 680 
5 681    Duke. The Turke with a most mighty Preparation
5 682 makes for Cyprus: Othello, the Fortitude of the place is
5 683 best knowne to you. And though we haue there a Substitute
5 684 of most allowed sufficiencie; yet opinion, a more
5 685 soueraigne Mistris of Effects, throwes a more safer
5 686 voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber
5 687 the glosse of your new Fortunes, with this more stubborne,
5 688 and boystrous expedition
5 689 
5 690    Othe. The Tirant Custome, most Graue Senators,
5 691 Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre
5 692 My thrice-driuen bed of Downe. I do agnize
5 693 A Naturall and prompt Alacratie,
5 694 I finde in hardnesse: and do vndertake
5 695 This present Warres against the Ottamites.
5 696 Most humbly therefore bending to your State,
5 697 I craue fit disposition for my Wife,
5 698 Due reference of Place, and Exhibition,
5 699 With such Accomodation and besort
5 700 As leuels with her breeding
5 701 
5 702    Duke. Why at her Fathers?
5 703   Bra. I will not haue it so
5 704 
5 705    Othe. Nor I
5 706 
5 707    Des. Nor would I there recide,
5 708 To put my Father in impatient thoughts
5 709 By being in his eye. Most Gracious Duke,
5 710 To my vnfolding, lend your prosperous eare,
5 711 And let me finde a Charter in your voice
5 712 T' assist my simplenesse
5 713 
5 714    Duke. What would you Desdemona?
5 715   Des. That I loue the Moore, to liue with him,
5 716 My downe-right violence, and storme of Fortunes,
5 717 May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdu'd
5 718 Euen to the very quality of my Lord;
5 719 I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
5 720 And to his Honours and his valiant parts,
5 721 Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate.
5 722 So that (deere Lords) if I be left behind
5 723 A Moth of Peace, and he go to the Warre,
5 724 The Rites for why I loue him, are bereft me:
5 725 And I a heauie interim shall support
5 726 By his deere absence. Let me go with him
5 727 
5 728    Othe. Let her haue your voice.
5 729 Vouch with me Heauen, I therefore beg it not
5 730 To please the pallate of my Appetite:
5 731 Nor to comply with heat the yong affects
5 732 In my defunct, and proper satisfaction.
5 733 But to be free, and bounteous to her minde:
5 734 And Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke
5 735 I will your serious and great businesse scant
5 736 When she is with me. No, when light wing'd Toyes
5 737 Of feather'd Cupid, seele with wanton dulnesse
5 738 My speculatiue, and offic'd Instrument:
5 739 That my Disports corrupt, and taint my businesse:
5 740 Let House-wiues make a Skillet of my Helme,
5 741 And all indigne, and base aduersities,
5 742 Make head against my Estimation
5 743 
5 744    Duke. Be it as you shall priuately determine,
5 745 Either for her stay, or going: th' Affaire cries hast:
5 746 And speed must answer it
5 747 
5 748    Sen. You must away to night
5 749 
5 750    Othe. With all my heart
5 751 
5 752    Duke. At nine i'th' morning, here wee'l meete againe.
5 753 Othello, leaue some Officer behind
5 754 And he shall our Commission bring to you:
5 755 And such things else of qualitie and respect
5 756 As doth import you
5 757 
5 758    Othe. So please your Grace, my Ancient,
5 759 A man he is of honesty and trust:
5 760 To his conueyance I assigne my wife,
5 761 With what else needfull, your good Grace shall think
5 762 To be sent after me
5 763 
5 764    Duke. Let it be so:
5 765 Good night to euery one. And Noble Signior,
5 766 If Vertue no delighted Beautie lacke,
5 767 Your Son-in-law is farre more Faire then Blacke
5 768 
5 769    Sen. Adieu braue Moore, vse Desdemona well
5 770 
5 771    Bra. Looke to her (Moore) if thou hast eies to see:
5 772 She ha's deceiu'd her Father, and may thee.
5 773 Enter.
5 774 
5 775   Othe. My life vpon her faith. Honest Iago,
5 776 My Desdemona must I leaue to thee:
5 777 I prythee let thy wife attend on her,
5 778 And bring them after in the best aduantage.
5 779 Come Desdemona, I haue but an houre
5 780 Of Loue, of wordly matter, and direction
5 781 To spend with thee. We must obey the time.
5 782 Enter.
5 783 
5 784   Rod. Iago
5 785 
5 786    Iago. What saist thou Noble heart?
5 787   Rod. What will I do, think'st thou?
5 788   Iago. Why go to bed and sleepe
5 789 
5 790    Rod. I will incontinently drowne my selfe
5 791 
5 792    Iago. If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why
5 793 thou silly Gentleman?
5 794   Rod. It is sillynesse to liue, when to liue is torment:
5 795 and then haue we a prescription to dye, when death is
5 796 our Physition
5 797 
5 798    Iago. Oh villanous: I haue look'd vpon the world
5 799 for foure times seuen yeares, and since I could distinguish
5 800 betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that
5 801 knew how to loue himselfe. Ere I would say, I would
5 802 drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would
5 803 change my Humanity with a Baboone
5 804 
5 805    Rod. What should I do? I confesse it is my shame
5 806 to be so fond, but it is not in my vertue to amend it
5 807 
5 808    Iago. Vertue? A figge, 'tis in our selues that we are
5 809 thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which,
5 810 our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Nettels,
5 811 or sowe Lettice: Set Hisope, and weede vp Time:
5 812 Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or distract it with
5 813 many: either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse, or manured
5 814 with Industry, why the power, and Corrigeable authoritie
5 815 of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues
5 816 had not one Scale of Reason, to poize another of Sensualitie,
5 817 the blood, and basenesse of our Natures would
5 818 conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions. But we
5 819 haue Reason to coole our raging Motions, our carnall
5 820 Stings, or vnbitted Lusts: whereof I take this, that you
5 821 call Loue, to be a Sect, or Seyen
5 822 
5 823    Rod. It cannot be
5 824 
5 825    Iago. It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission
5 826 of the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy selfe? Drown
5 827 Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profest me thy Friend,
5 828 and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing, with Cables of
5 829 perdurable toughnesse. I could neuer better steed thee
5 830 then now. Put Money in thy purse: follow thou the
5 831 Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an vsurp'd Beard. I say
5 832 put Money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona
5 833 should continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in
5 834 thy purse: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commencement
5 835 in her, and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration,
5 836 put but Money in thy purse. These Moores
5 837 are changeable in their wils: fill thy purse with Money.
5 838 The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts,
5 839 shalbe to him shortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She
5 840 must change for youth: when she is sated with his body
5 841 she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Money
5 842 in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe, do
5 843 it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Money
5 844 thou canst: If Sanctimonie, and a fraile vow, betwixt
5 845 an erring Barbarian, and super-subtle Venetian be
5 846 not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou
5 847 shalt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drowning
5 848 thy selfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou rather
5 849 to be hang'd in Compassing thy ioy, then to be
5 850 drown'd, and go without her
5 851 
5 852    Rodo. Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
5 853 the issue?
5 854   Iago. Thou art sure of me: Go make Money: I haue
5 855 told thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I
5 856 hate the Moore. My cause is hearted; thine hath no lesse
5 857 reason. Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge, against
5 858 him. If thou canst Cuckold him, thou dost thy selfe a
5 859 pleasure, me a sport. There are many Euents in the
5 860 Wombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauerse, go,
5 861 prouide thy Money. We will haue more of this to morrow.
5 862 Adieu
5 863 
5 864    Rod. Where shall we meete i'th' morning?
5 865   Iago. At my Lodging
5 866 
5 867    Rod. Ile be with thee betimes
5 868 
5 869    Iago. Go too, farewell. Do you heare Rodorigo?
5 870   Rod. Ile sell all my Land.
5 871 Enter.
5 872 
5 873   Iago. Thus do I euer make my Foole, my purse:
5 874 For I mine owne gain'd knowledge should prophane
5 875 If I would time expend with such Snipe,
5 876 But for my Sport, and Profit: I hate the Moore,
5 877 And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
5 878 She ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true,
5 879 But I, for meere suspition in that kinde,
5 880 Will do, as if for Surety. He holds me well,
5 881 The better shall my purpose worke on him:
5 882 Cassio's a proper man: Let me see now,
5 883 To get his Place, and to plume vp my will
5 884 In double Knauery. How? How? Let's see.
5 885 After some time, to abuse Othello's eares,
5 886 That he is too familiar with his wife:
5 887 He hath a person, and a smooth dispose
5 888 To be suspected: fram'd to make women false.
5 889 The Moore is of a free, and open Nature,
5 890 That thinkes men honest, that but seeme to be so,
5 891 And will as tenderly be lead by'th' Nose
5 892 As Asses are:
5 893 I hau't: it is engendred: Hell, and Night,
5 894 Must bring this monstrous Birth, to the worlds light.
5 895 
5 896 Actus Secundus. Scena Prima.
5 897 
5 898 Enter Montano, and two Gentlemen.
5 899 
5 900   Mon. What from the Cape, can you discerne at Sea?
5 901   1.Gent. Nothing at all, it is a high wrought Flood:
5 902 I cannot 'twixt the Heauen, and the Maine,
5 903 Descry a Saile
5 904 
5 905    Mon. Me thinks, the wind hath spoke aloud at Land,
5 906 A fuller blast ne're shooke our Battlements:
5 907 If it hath ruffiand so vpon the Sea,
5 908 What ribbes of Oake, when Mountaines melt on them,
5 909 Can hold the Morties. What shall we heare of this?
5 910   2 A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet:
5 911 For do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore,
5 912 The chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds,
5 913 The winde-shak'd-Surge, with high & monstrous Maine
5 914 Seemes to cast water on the burning Beare,
5 915 And quench the Guards of th' euer-fixed Pole:
5 916 I neuer did like mollestation view
5 917 On the enchafed Flood
5 918 
5 919    Men. If that the Turkish Fleete
5 920 Be not enshelter'd, and embay'd, they are drown'd,
5 921 It is impossible to beare it out.
5 922 Enter a Gentleman.
5 923 
5 924   3 Newes Laddes: our warres are done:
5 925 The desperate Tempest hath so bang'd the Turkes,
5 926 That their designement halts. A Noble ship of Venice,
5 927 Hath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance
5 928 On most part of their Fleet
5 929 
5 930    Mon. How? Is this true?
5 931   3 The Ship is heere put in: A Verennessa, Michael Cassio
5 932 Lieutenant to the warlike Moore, Othello,
5 933 Is come on Shore: the Moore himselfe at Sea,
5 934 And is in full Commission heere for Cyprus
5 935 
5 936    Mon. I am glad on't:
5 937 'Tis a worthy Gouernour
5 938 
5 939    3 But this same Cassio, though he speake of comfort,
5 940 Touching the Turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly,
5 941 And praye the Moore be safe; for they were parted
5 942 With fowle and violent Tempest
5 943 
5 944    Mon. Pray Heauens he be:
5 945 For I haue seru'd him, and the man commands
5 946 Like a full Soldier. Let's to the Sea-side (hoa)
5 947 As well to see the Vessell that's come in,
5 948 As to throw-out our eyes for braue Othello,
5 949 Euen till we make the Maine, and th' Eriall blew,
5 950 An indistinct regard
5 951 
5 952    Gent. Come, let's do so;
5 953 For euery Minute is expectancie
5 954 Of more Arriuancie.
5 955 Enter Cassio.
5 956 
5 957   Cassi. Thankes you, the valiant of the warlike Isle,
5 958 That so approoue the Moore: Oh let the Heauens
5 959 Giue him defence against the Elements,
5 960 For I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea
5 961 
5 962    Mon. Is he well ship'd?
5 963   Cassio. His Barke is stoutly Timber'd, and his Pylot
5 964 Of verie expert, and approu'd Allowance;
5 965 Therefore my hope's (not surfetted to death)
5 966 Stand in bold Cure
5 967 
5 968    Within. A Saile, a Saile, a Saile
5 969 
5 970    Cassio. What noise?
5 971   Gent. The Towne is empty; on the brow o'th' Sea
5 972 Stand rankes of People and they cry, a Saile
5 973 
5 974    Cassio. My hopes do shape him for the Gouernor
5 975 
5 976    Gent. They do discharge their Shot of Courtesie,
5 977 Our Friends, at least
5 978 
5 979    Cassio. I pray you Sir, go forth,
5 980 And giue vs truth who 'tis that is arriu'd
5 981 
5 982    Gent. I shall.
5 983 Enter.
5 984 
5 985   Mon. But good Lieutenant, is your Generall wiu'd?
5 986   Cassio. Most fortunately: he hath atchieu'd a Maid
5 987 That paragons description, and wilde Fame:
5 988 One that excels the quirkes of Blazoning pens,
5 989 And in th' essentiall Vesture of Creation,
5 990 Do's tyre the Ingeniuer.
5 991 Enter Gentleman.
5 992 
5 993 How now? Who ha's put in?
5 994   Gent. 'Tis one Iago, Auncient to the Generall
5 995 
5 996    Cassio. Ha's had most fauourable, and happie speed:
5 997 Tempests themselues, high Seas, and howling windes,
5 998 The gutter'd-Rockes, and Congregated Sands,
5 999 Traitors ensteep'd, to enclogge the guiltlesse Keele,
5 1000 As hauing sence of Beautie, do omit
5 1001 Their mortall Natures, letting go safely by
5 1002 The Diuine Desdemona
5 1003 
5 1004    Mon. What is she?
5 1005   Cassio. She that I spake of:
5 1006 Our great Captains Captaine,
5 1007 Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
5 1008 Whose footing heere anticipates our thoughts,
5 1009 A Senights speed. Great Ioue, Othello guard,
5 1010 And swell his Saile with thine owne powrefull breath,
5 1011 That he may blesse this Bay with his tall Ship,
5 1012 Make loues quicke pants in Desdemonaes Armes,
5 1013 Giue renew'd fire to our extincted Spirits.
5 1014 
5 1015 Enter Desdemona, Iago, Rodorigo, and Aemilia.
5 1016 
5 1017 Oh behold,
5 1018 The Riches of the Ship is come on shore:
5 1019 You men of Cyprus, let her haue your knees.
5 1020 Haile to thee Ladie: and the grace of Heauen,
5 1021 Before, behinde thee, and on euery hand
5 1022 Enwheele thee round
5 1023 
5 1024    Des. I thanke you, Valiant Cassio,
5 1025 What tydings can you tell of my Lord?
5 1026   Cas. He is not yet arriu'd, nor know I ought
5 1027 But that he's well, and will be shortly heere
5 1028 
5 1029    Des. Oh, but I feare:
5 1030 How lost you company?
5 1031   Cassio. The great Contention of Sea, and Skies
5 1032 Parted our fellowship. But hearke, a Saile
5 1033 
5 1034    Within. A Saile, a Saile
5 1035 
5 1036    Gent. They giue this greeting to the Cittadell:
5 1037 This likewise is a Friend
5 1038 
5 1039    Cassio. See for the Newes:
5 1040 Good Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome Mistris:
5 1041 Let it not gaule your patience (good Iago)
5 1042 That I extend my Manners. 'Tis my breeding,
5 1043 That giues me this bold shew of Curtesie
5 1044 
5 1045    Iago. Sir, would she giue you so much of her lippes,
5 1046 As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me,
5 1047 You would haue enough
5 1048 
5 1049    Des. Alas: she ha's no speech
5 1050 
5 1051    Iago. Infaith too much:
5 1052 I finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe.
5 1053 Marry before your Ladyship, I grant,
5 1054 She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
5 1055 And chides with thinking
5 1056 
5 1057    aemil. You haue little cause to say so
5 1058 
5 1059    Iago. Come on, come on: you are Pictures out of
5 1060 doore: Bells in your Parlours: Wilde-Cats in your Kitchens:
5 1061 Saints in your Iniuries: Diuels being offended:
5 1062 Players in your Huswiferie, and Huswiues in your
5 1063 Beds
5 1064 
5 1065    Des. Oh, fie vpon thee, Slanderer
5 1066 
5 1067    Iago. Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke,
5 1068 You rise to play, and go to bed to worke.
5 1069 Aemil. You shall not write my praise
5 1070 
5 1071    Iago. No, let me not
5 1072 
5 1073    Desde. What would'st write of me, if thou should'st
5 1074 praise me?
5 1075   Iago. Oh, gentle Lady, do not put me too't,
5 1076 For I am nothing, if not Criticall
5 1077 
5 1078    Des. Come on, assay.
5 1079 There's one gone to the Harbour?
5 1080   Iago. I Madam
5 1081 
5 1082    Des. I am not merry: but I do beguile
5 1083 The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
5 1084 Come, how would'st thou praise me?
5 1085   Iago. I am about it, but indeed my inuention comes
5 1086 from my pate, as Birdlyme do's from Freeze, it pluckes
5 1087 out Braines and all. But my Muse labours, and thus she
5 1088 is deliuer'd.
5 1089 If she be faire, and wise: fairenesse, and wit,
5 1090 The ones for vse, the other vseth it
5 1091 
5 1092    Des. Well prais'd:
5 1093 How if she be Blacke and Witty?
5 1094   Iago. If she be blacke, and thereto haue a wit,
5 1095 She'le find a white, that shall her blacknesse fit
5 1096 
5 1097    Des. Worse, and worse.
5 1098 Aemil. How if Faire, and Foolish?
5 1099   Iago. She neuer yet was foolish that was faire,
5 1100 For euen her folly helpt her to an heire
5 1101 
5 1102    Desde. These are old fond Paradoxes, to make Fooles
5 1103 laugh i'th' Alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou
5 1104 for her that's Foule, and Foolish
5 1105 
5 1106    Iago. There's none so foule and foolish thereunto,
5 1107 But do's foule pranks, which faire, and wise-ones do
5 1108 
5 1109    Desde. Oh heauy ignorance: thou praisest the worst
5 1110 best. But what praise could'st thou bestow on a deseruing
5 1111 woman indeed? One, that in the authorithy of her
5 1112 merit, did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it
5 1113 selfe
5 1114 
5 1115    Iago. She that was euer faire, and neuer proud,
5 1116 Had Tongue at will, and yet was neuer loud:
5 1117 Neuer lackt Gold, and yet went neuer gay,
5 1118 Fled from her wish, and yet said now I may.
5 1119 She that being angred, her reuenge being nie,
5 1120 Bad her wrong stay, and her displeasure flie:
5 1121 She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile,
5 1122 To change the Cods-head for the Salmons taile:
5 1123 She that could thinke, and neu'r disclose her mind,
5 1124 See Suitors following, and not looke behind:
5 1125 She was a wight, (if euer such wightes were)
5 1126   Des. To do what?
5 1127   Iago. To suckle Fooles, and chronicle small Beere
5 1128 
5 1129    Desde. Oh most lame and impotent conclusion. Do
5 1130 not learne of him aemillia, though he be thy husband.
5 1131 How say you (Cassio) is he not a most prophane, and liberall
5 1132 Counsailor?
5 1133   Cassio. He speakes home (Madam) you may rellish
5 1134 him more in the Souldier, then in the Scholler
5 1135 
5 1136    Iago. He takes her by the palme: I, well said, whisper.
5 1137 With as little a web as this, will I ensnare as great
5 1138 a Fly as Cassio. I smile vpon her, do: I will giue thee
5 1139 in thine owne Courtship. You say true, 'tis so indeed.
5 1140 If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie,
5 1141 it had beene better you had not kiss'd your three fingers
5 1142 so oft, which now againe you are most apt to play
5 1143 the Sir, in. Very good: well kiss'd, and excellent Curtsie:
5 1144 'tis so indeed. Yet againe, your fingers to your
5 1145 lippes? Would they were Cluster-pipes for your
5 1146 sake.
5 1147 The Moore I know his Trumpet
5 1148 
5 1149    Cassio. 'Tis truely so
5 1150 
5 1151    Des. Let's meete him, and recieue him
5 1152 
5 1153    Cassio. Loe, where he comes.
5 1154 Enter Othello, and Attendants.
5 1155 
5 1156   Oth. O, my faire Warriour
5 1157 
5 1158    Des. My deere Othello
5 1159 
5 1160    Othe. It giues me wonder great, as my content
5 1161 To see you heere before me.
5 1162 Oh my Soules Ioy:
5 1163 If after euery Tempest, come such Calmes,
5 1164 May the windes blow, till they haue waken'd death:
5 1165 And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas
5 1166 Olympus high: and duck againe as low,
5 1167 As hell's from Heauen. If it were now to dye,
5 1168 'Twere now to be most happy. For I feare,
5 1169 My Soule hath her content so absolute,
5 1170 That not another comfort like to this,
5 1171 Succeedes in vnknowne Fate
5 1172 
5 1173    Des. The Heauens forbid
5 1174 But that our Loues
5 1175 And Comforts should encrease
5 1176 Euen as our dayes do grow
5 1177 
5 1178    Othe. Amen to that (sweet Powers)
5 1179 I cannot speake enough of this content,
5 1180 It stoppes me heere: it is too much of ioy.
5 1181 And this, and this the greatest discords be
5 1182 That ere our hearts shall make
5 1183 
5 1184    Iago. Oh you are well tun'd now: But Ile set downe
5 1185 the peggs that make this Musicke, as honest as I am
5 1186 
5 1187    Othe. Come: let vs to the Castle.
5 1188 Newes (Friends) our Warres are done:
5 1189 The Turkes are drown'd.
5 1190 How do's my old Acquaintance of this Isle?
5 1191 (Hony) you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus,
5 1192 I haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet,
5 1193 I prattle out of fashion, and I doate
5 1194 In mine owne comforts. I prythee, good Iago,
5 1195 Go to the Bay, and disimbarke my Coffers:
5 1196 Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell,
5 1197 He is a good one, and his worthynesse
5 1198 Do's challenge much respect. Come Desdemona,
5 1199 Once more well met at Cyprus.
5 1200 
5 1201 Exit Othello and Desdemona.
5 1202 
5 1203   Iago. Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour.
5 1204 Come thither, if thou be'st Valiant, (as they say base men
5 1205 being in Loue, haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures,
5 1206 more then is natiue to them) list-me; the Lieutenant to
5 1207 night watches on the Court of Guard. First, I must tell
5 1208 thee this: Desdemona, is directly in loue with him
5 1209 
5 1210    Rod. With him? Why, 'tis not possible
5 1211 
5 1212    Iago. Lay thy finger thus: and let thy soule be instructed.
5 1213 Marke me with what violence she first lou'd
5 1214 the Moore, but for bragging, and telling her fantasticall
5 1215 lies. To loue him still for prating, let not thy discreet
5 1216 heart thinke it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight
5 1217 shall she haue to looke on the diuell? When the Blood
5 1218 is made dull with the Act of Sport, there should be a
5 1219 game to enflame it, and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite.
5 1220 Louelinesse in fauour, simpathy in yeares, Manners,
5 1221 and Beauties: all which the Moore is defectiue in. Now
5 1222 for want of these requir'd Conueniences, her delicate
5 1223 tendernesse wil finde it selfe abus'd, begin to heaue the,
5 1224 gorge, disrellish and abhorre the Moore, very Nature wil
5 1225 instruct her in it, and compell her to some second choice.
5 1226 Now Sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and vnforc'd
5 1227 position) who stands so eminent in the degree of
5 1228 this Fortune, as Cassio do's: a knaue very voluble: no
5 1229 further conscionable, then in putting on the meere forme
5 1230 of Ciuill, and Humaine seeming, for the better compasse
5 1231 of his salt, and most hidden loose Affection? Why none,
5 1232 why none: A slipper, and subtle knaue, a finder of occasion:
5 1233 that he's an eye can stampe, and counterfeit Aduantages,
5 1234 though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe.
5 1235 A diuelish knaue: besides, the knaue is handsome, young:
5 1236 and hath all those requisites in him, that folly and greene
5 1237 mindes looke after. A pestilent compleat knaue, and the
5 1238 woman hath found him already
5 1239 
5 1240    Rodo. I cannot beleeue that in her, she's full of most
5 1241 bless'd condition
5 1242 
5 1243    Iago. Bless'd figges-end. The Wine she drinkes is
5 1244 made of grapes. If shee had beene bless'd, shee would
5 1245 neuer haue lou'd the Moore: Bless'd pudding. Didst thou
5 1246 not see her paddle with the palme of his hand? Didst not
5 1247 marke that?
5 1248   Rod. Yes, that I did: but that was but curtesie
5 1249 
5 1250    Iago . Leacherie by this hand: an Index, and obscure
5 1251 prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts.
5 1252 They met so neere with their lippes, that their breathes
5 1253 embrac'd together. Villanous thoughts Rodorigo, when
5 1254 these mutabilities so marshall the way, hard at hand
5 1255 comes the Master, and maine exercise, th' incorporate
5 1256 conclusion: Pish. But Sir, be you rul'd by me. I haue
5 1257 brought you from Venice. Watch you to night: for
5 1258 the Command, Ile lay't vpon you. Cassio knowes you
5 1259 not: Ile not be farre from you. Do you finde some occasion
5 1260 to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or
5 1261 tainting his discipline, or from what other course
5 1262 you please, which the time shall more fauorably minister
5 1263 
5 1264    Rod. Well
5 1265 
5 1266    Iago. Sir, he's rash, and very sodaine in Choller: and
5 1267 happely may strike at you, prouoke him that he may: for
5 1268 euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny.
5 1269 Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe,
5 1270 but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you
5 1271 haue a shorter iourney to your desires, by the meanes I
5 1272 shall then haue to preferre them. And the impediment
5 1273 most profitably remoued, without the which there were
5 1274 no expectation of our prosperitie
5 1275 
5 1276    Rodo. I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity
5 1277 
5 1278    Iago. I warrant thee. Meete me by and by at the
5 1279 Cittadell. I must fetch his Necessaries a Shore. Farewell
5 1280 
5 1281    Rodo. Adieu.
5 1282 Enter.
5 1283 
5 1284   Iago. That Cassio loues her, I do well beleeu't:
5 1285 That she loues him, 'tis apt, and of great Credite.
5 1286 The Moore (howbeit that I endure him not)
5 1287 Is of a constant, louing, Noble Nature,
5 1288 And I dare thinke, he'le proue to Desdemona
5 1289 A most deere husband. Now I do loue her too,
5 1290 Not out of absolute Lust, (though peraduenture
5 1291 I stand accomptant for as great a sin)
5 1292 But partely led to dyet my Reuenge,
5 1293 For that I do suspect the lustie Moore
5 1294 Hath leap'd into my Seate. The thought whereof,
5 1295 Doth (like a poysonous Minerall) gnaw my Inwardes:
5 1296 And nothing can, or shall content my Soule
5 1297 Till I am eeuen'd with him, wife, for wife.
5 1298 Or fayling so, yet that I put the Moore,
5 1299 At least into a Ielouzie so strong
5 1300 That iudgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,
5 1301 If this poore Trash of Venice, whom I trace
5 1302 For his quicke hunting, stand the putting on,
5 1303 Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip,
5 1304 Abuse him to the Moore, in the right garbe
5 1305 (For I feare Cassio with my Night-Cape too)
5 1306 Make the Moore thanke me, loue me, and reward me,
5 1307 For making him egregiously an Asse,
5 1308 And practising vpon his peace, and quiet,
5 1309 Euen to madnesse. 'Tis heere: but yet confus'd,
5 1310 Knaueries plaine face, is neuer seene, till vs'd.
5 1311 Enter.
5 1312 
5 1313 
5 1314 Scena Secunda.
5 1315 
5 1316 Enter Othello's Herald with a Proclamation.
5 1317 
5 1318   Herald. It is Othello's pleasure, our Noble and Valiant
5 1319 Generall. That vpon certaine tydings now arriu'd,
5 1320 importing the meere perdition of the Turkish Fleete:
5 1321 euery man put himselfe into Triumph. Some to daunce,
5 1322 some to make Bonfires, each man, to what Sport and
5 1323 Reuels his addition leads him. For besides these beneficiall
5 1324 Newes, it is the Celebration of his Nuptiall. So
5 1325 much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices
5 1326 are open, & there is full libertie of Feasting from this
5 1327 present houre of fiue, till the Bell haue told eleuen.
5 1328 Blesse the Isle of Cyprus, and our Noble Generall Othello.
5 1329 Enter.
5 1330 
5 1331 Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.
5 1332 
5 1333   Othe. Good Michael, looke you to the guard to night.
5 1334 Let's teach our selues that Honourable stop,
5 1335 Not to out-sport discretion
5 1336 
5 1337    Cas. Iago, hath direction what to do.
5 1338 But notwithstanding with my personall eye
5 1339 Will I looke to't
5 1340 
5 1341    Othe. Iago, is most honest:
5 1342 Michael, goodnight. To morrow with your earliest,
5 1343 Let me haue speech with you. Come my deere Loue,
5 1344 The purchase made, the fruites are to ensue,
5 1345 That profit's yet to come 'tweene me, and you.
5 1346 Goodnight.
5 1347 Enter.
5 1348 
5 1349 Enter Iago.
5 1350 
5 1351   Cas. Welcome Iago: we must to the Watch
5 1352 
5 1353    Iago. Not this houre Lieutenant: 'tis not yet ten
5 1354 o'th' clocke. Our Generall cast vs thus earely for the
5 1355 loue of his Desdemona: Who, let vs not therefore blame;
5 1356 he hath not yet made wanton the night with her: and
5 1357 she is sport for Ioue
5 1358 
5 1359    Cas. She's a most exquisite Lady
5 1360 
5 1361    Iago. And Ile warrant her, full of Game
5 1362 
5 1363    Cas. Indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature
5 1364 
5 1365    Iago. What an eye she ha's?
5 1366 Me thinkes it sounds a parley to prouocation
5 1367 
5 1368    Cas. An inuiting eye:
5 1369 And yet me thinkes right modest
5 1370 
5 1371    Iago. And when she speakes,
5 1372 Is it not an Alarum to Loue?
5 1373   Cas. She is indeed perfection
5 1374 
5 1375    Iago. Well: happinesse to their Sheetes. Come Lieutenant,
5 1376 I haue a stope of Wine, and heere without are a
5 1377 brace of Cyprus Gallants, that would faine haue a measure
5 1378 to the health of blacke Othello
5 1379 
5 1380    Cas. Not to night, good Iago, I haue very poore,
5 1381 and vnhappie Braines for drinking. I could well wish
5 1382 Curtesie would inuent some other Custome of entertainment
5 1383 
5 1384    Iago. Oh, they are our Friends: but one Cup, Ile
5 1385 drinke for you
5 1386 
5 1387    Cassio. I haue drunke but one Cup to night, and that
5 1388 was craftily qualified too: and behold what inouation
5 1389 it makes heere. I am infortunate in the infirmity, and
5 1390 dare not taske my weakenesse with any more
5 1391 
5 1392    Iago. What man? 'Tis a night of Reuels, the Gallants
5 1393 desire it
5 1394 
5 1395    Cas. Where are they?
5 1396   Iago. Heere, at the doore: I pray you call them in
5 1397 
5 1398    Cas. Ile do't, but it dislikes me.
5 1399 Enter.
5 1400 
5 1401   Iago. If I can fasten but one Cup vpon him
5 1402 With that which he hath drunke to night alreadie,
5 1403 He'l be as full of Quarrell, and offence
5 1404 As my yong Mistris dogge.
5 1405 Now my sicke Foole Rodorigo,
5 1406 Whom Loue hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
5 1407 To Desdemona hath to night Carrows'd.
5 1408 Potations, pottle-deepe; and he's to watch.
5 1409 Three else of Cyprus, Noble swelling Spirites,
5 1410 (That hold their Honours in a wary distance,
5 1411 The very Elements of this Warrelike Isle)
5 1412 Haue I to night fluster'd with flowing Cups,
5 1413 And they Watch too.
5 1414 Now 'mongst this Flocke of drunkards
5 1415 Am I put to our Cassio in some Action
5 1416 That may offend the Isle. But here they come.
5 1417 Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen.
5 1418 
5 1419 If Consequence do but approue my dreame,
5 1420 My Boate sailes freely, both with winde and Streame
5 1421 
5 1422    Cas. 'Fore heauen, they haue giuen me a rowse already
5 1423 
5 1424    Mon. Good-faith a litle one: not past a pint, as I am a
5 1425 Souldier
5 1426 
5 1427    Iago. Some Wine hoa.
5 1428 And let me the Cannakin clinke, clinke:
5 1429 And let me the Cannakin clinke.
5 1430 A Souldiers a man: Oh, mans life's but a span,
5 1431 Why then let a Souldier drinke.
5 1432 Some Wine Boyes
5 1433 
5 1434    Cas. 'Fore Heauen: an excellent Song
5 1435 
5 1436    Iago. I learn'd it in England: where indeed they are
5 1437 most potent in Potting. Your Dane, your Germaine,
5 1438 and your swag-belly'd Hollander, (drinke hoa) are
5 1439 nothing to your English
5 1440 
5 1441    Cassio. Is your Englishmen so exquisite in his drinking?
5 1442   Iago. Why, he drinkes you with facillitie, your Dane
5 1443 dead drunke. He sweates not to ouerthrow your Almaine.
5 1444 He giues your Hollander a vomit, ere the next
5 1445 Pottle can be fill'd
5 1446 
5 1447    Cas. To the health of our Generall
5 1448 
5 1449    Mon. I am for it Lieutenant: and Ile do you Iustice
5 1450 
5 1451    Iago. Oh sweet England.
5 1452 King Stephen was anda worthy Peere,
5 1453 His Breeches cost him but a Crowne,
5 1454 He held them Six pence all to deere,
5 1455 With that he cal'd the Tailor Lowne:
5 1456 He was a wight of high Renowne,
5 1457 And thou art but of low degree:
5 1458 'Tis Pride that pulls the Country downe,
5 1459 And take thy awl'd Cloake about thee.
5 1460 Some Wine hoa
5 1461 
5 1462    Cassio. Why this is a more exquisite Song then the other
5 1463 
5 1464    Iago. Will you heare't againe?
5 1465   Cas. No: for I hold him to be vnworthy of his Place,
5 1466 that do's those things. Well: heau'ns aboue all: and
5 1467 there be soules must be saued, and there be soules must
5 1468 not be saued
5 1469 
5 1470    Iago. It's true, good Lieutenant
5 1471 
5 1472    Cas. For mine owne part, no offence to the Generall,
5 1473 nor any man of qualitie: I hope to be saued
5 1474 
5 1475    Iago. And so do I too Lieutenant
5 1476 
5 1477    Cassio. I: (but by your leaue) not before me. The
5 1478 Lieutenant is to be saued before the Ancient. Let's haue
5 1479 no more of this: let's to our Affaires. Forgiue vs our
5 1480 sinnes: Gentlemen let's looke to our businesse. Do not
5 1481 thinke Gentlemen, I am drunke: this is my Ancient, this
5 1482 is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunke
5 1483 now: I can stand well enough, and I speake well enough
5 1484 
5 1485    Gent. Excellent well
5 1486 
5 1487    Cas. Why very well then: you must not thinke then,
5 1488 that I am drunke.
5 1489 Enter.
5 1490 
5 1491   Monta. To th' Platforme (Masters) come, let's set the
5 1492 Watch
5 1493 
5 1494    Iago. You see this Fellow, that is gone before,
5 1495 He's a Souldier, fit to stand by Caesar,
5 1496 And giue direction. And do but see his vice,
5 1497 'Tis to his vertue, a iust Equinox,
5 1498 The one as long as th' other. 'Tis pittie of him:
5 1499 I feare the trust Othello puts him in,
5 1500 On some odde time of his infirmitie
5 1501 Will shake this Island
5 1502 
5 1503    Mont. But is he often thus?
5 1504   Iago. 'Tis euermore his prologue to his sleepe,
5 1505 He'le watch the Horologe a double Set,
5 1506 If Drinke rocke not his Cradle
5 1507 
5 1508    Mont. It were well
5 1509 The Generall were put in mind of it:
5 1510 Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature
5 1511 Prizes the vertue that appeares in Cassio,
5 1512 And lookes not on his euills: is not this true?
5 1513 Enter Rodorigo.
5 1514 
5 1515   Iago. How now Rodorigo?
5 1516 I pray you after the Lieutenant, go
5 1517 
5 1518    Mon. And 'tis great pitty, that the Noble Moore
5 1519 Should hazard such a Place, as his owne Second
5 1520 With one of an ingraft Infirmitie,
5 1521 It were an honest Action, to say so
5 1522 To the Moore
5 1523 
5 1524    Iago. Not I, for this faire Island,
5 1525 I do loue Cassio well: and would do much
5 1526 To cure him of this euill, But hearke, what noise?
5 1527 Enter Cassio pursuing Rodorigo.
5 1528 
5 1529   Cas. You Rogue: you Rascall
5 1530 
5 1531    Mon. What's the matter Lieutenant?
5 1532   Cas. A Knaue teach me my dutie? Ile beate the
5 1533 Knaue in to a Twiggen-Bottle
5 1534 
5 1535    Rod. Beate me?
5 1536   Cas. Dost thou prate, Rogue?
5 1537   Mon. Nay, good Lieutenant:
5 1538 I pray you Sir, hold your hand
5 1539 
5 1540    Cassio. Let me go (Sir)
5 1541 Or Ile knocke you o're the Mazard
5 1542 
5 1543    Mon. Come, come: you're drunke
5 1544 
5 1545    Cassio. Drunke?
5 1546   Iago. Away I say: go out and cry a Mutinie.
5 1547 Nay good Lieutenant. Alas Gentlemen:
5 1548 Helpe hoa. Lieutenant. Sir Montano:
5 1549 Helpe Masters. Heere's a goodly Watch indeed.
5 1550 Who's that which rings the Bell: Diablo, hoa:
5 1551 The Towne will rise. Fie, fie Lieutenant,
5 1552 You'le be asham'd for euer.
5 1553 Enter Othello, and Attendants.
5 1554 
5 1555   Othe. What is the matter heere?
5 1556   Mon. I bleed still, I am hurt to th' death. He dies
5 1557 
5 1558    Othe. Hold for your liues
5 1559 
5 1560    Iag. Hold hoa: Lieutenant, Sir Montano, Gentlemen:
5 1561 Haue you forgot all place of sense and dutie?
5 1562 Hold. The Generall speaks to you: hold for shame
5 1563 
5 1564    Oth. Why how now hoa? From whence ariseth this?
5 1565 Are we turn'd Turkes? and to our selues do that
5 1566 Which Heauen hath forbid the Ottamittes.
5 1567 For Christian shame, put by this barbarous Brawle:
5 1568 He that stirs next, to carue for his owne rage,
5 1569 Holds his soule light: He dies vpon his Motion.
5 1570 Silence that dreadfull Bell, it frights the Isle,
5 1571 From her propriety. What is the matter, Masters?
5 1572 Honest Iago, that lookes dead with greeuing,
5 1573 Speake: who began this? On thy loue I charge thee?
5 1574   Iago. I do not know: Friends all, but now, euen now.
5 1575 In Quarter, and in termes like Bride, and Groome
5 1576 Deuesting them for Bed: and then, but now:
5 1577 (As if some Planet had vnwitted men)
5 1578 Swords out, and tilting one at others breastes,
5 1579 In opposition bloody. I cannot speake
5 1580 Any begining to this peeuish oddes.
5 1581 And would, in Action glorious, I had lost
5 1582 Those legges, that brought me to a part of it
5 1583 
5 1584    Othe. How comes it (Michaell) you are thus forgot?
5 1585   Cas. I pray you pardon me, I cannot speake
5 1586 
5 1587    Othe. Worthy Montano, you were wont to be ciuill:
5 1588 The grauitie, and stillnesse of your youth
5 1589 The world hath noted. And your name is great
5 1590 In mouthes of wisest Censure. What's the matter
5 1591 That you vnlace your reputation thus,
5 1592 And spend your rich opinion, for the name
5 1593 Of a night-brawler? Giue me answer to it
5 1594 
5 1595    Mon. Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger,
5 1596 Your Officer Iago, can informe you,
5 1597 While I spare speech which something now offends me.
5 1598 Of all that I do know, nor know I ought
5 1599 By me, that's said, or done amisse this night,
5 1600 Vnlesse selfe-charitie be sometimes a vice,
5 1601 And to defend our selues, it be a sinne
5 1602 When violence assailes vs
5 1603 
5 1604    Othe. Now by Heauen,
5 1605 My blood begins my safer Guides to rule,
5 1606 And passion (hauing my best iudgement collied)
5 1607 Assaies to leade the way. If I once stir,
5 1608 Or do but lift this Arme, the best of you
5 1609 Shall sinke in my rebuke. Giue me to know
5 1610 How this foule Rout began: Who set it on,
5 1611 And he that is approu'd in this offence,
5 1612 Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
5 1613 Shall loose me. What in a Towne of warre,
5 1614 Yet wilde, the peoples hearts brim-full of feare,
5 1615 To Manage priuate, and domesticke Quarrell?
5 1616 In night, and on the Court and Guard of safetie?
5 1617 'Tis monstrous: Iago, who began't?
5 1618   Mon. If partially Affin'd, or league in office,
5 1619 Thou dost deliuer more, or lesse then Truth,
5 1620 Thou art no Souldier
5 1621 
5 1622    Iago. Touch me not so neere,
5 1623 I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth,
5 1624 Then it should do offence to Michaell Cassio.
5 1625 Yet I perswade my selfe, to speake the truth
5 1626 Shall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall:
5 1627 Montano and my selfe being in speech,
5 1628 There comes a Fellow, crying out for helpe,
5 1629 And Cassio following him with determin'd Sword
5 1630 To execute vpon him. Sir, this Gentleman,
5 1631 Steppes in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
5 1632 My selfe, the crying Fellow did pursue,
5 1633 Least by his clamour (as it so fell out)
5 1634 The Towne might fall in fright. He, (swift of foote)
5 1635 Out-ran my purpose: and I return'd then rather
5 1636 For that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords,
5 1637 And Cassio high in oath: Which till to night
5 1638 I nere might say before. When I came backe
5 1639 (For this was briefe) I found them close together
5 1640 At blow, and thrust, euen as againe they were
5 1641 When you your selfe did part them.
5 1642 More of this matter cannot I report,
5 1643 But Men are Men: The best sometimes forget,
5 1644 Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
5 1645 As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
5 1646 Yet surely Cassio, I beleeue receiu'd
5 1647 From him that fled, some strange Indignitie,
5 1648 Which patience could not passe
5 1649 
5 1650    Othe. I know Iago
5 1651 Thy honestie, and loue doth mince this matter,
5 1652 Making it light to Cassio: Cassio, I loue thee,
5 1653 But neuer more be Officer of mine.
5 1654 Enter Desdemona attended.
5 1655 
5 1656 Looke if my gentle Loue be not rais'd vp:
5 1657 Ile make thee an example
5 1658 
5 1659    Des. What is the matter (Deere?)
5 1660   Othe. All's well, Sweeting:
5 1661 Come away to bed. Sir for your hurts,
5 1662 My selfe will be your Surgeon. Lead him off:
5 1663 Iago, looke with care about the Towne,
5 1664 And silence those whom this vil'd brawle distracted.
5 1665 Come Desdemona, 'tis the Soldiers life,
5 1666 To haue their Balmy slumbers wak'd with strife.
5 1667 Enter.
5 1668 
5 1669   Iago. What are you hurt Lieutenant?
5 1670   Cas. I, past all Surgery
5 1671 
5 1672    Iago. Marry Heauen forbid
5 1673 
5 1674    Cas. Reputation, Reputation, Reputation: Oh I haue
5 1675 lost my Reputation. I haue lost the immortall part of
5 1676 myselfe, and what remaines is bestiall. My Reputation,
5 1677 Iago, my Reputation
5 1678 
5 1679    Iago. As I am an honest man I had thought you had
5 1680 receiued some bodily wound; there is more sence in that
5 1681 then in Reputation. Reputation is an idle, and most false
5 1682 imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deseruing.
5 1683 You haue lost no Reputation at all, vnlesse you
5 1684 repute your selfe such a looser. What man, there are
5 1685 more wayes to recouer the Generall againe. You are
5 1686 but now cast in his moode, (a punishment more in policie,
5 1687 then in malice) euen so as one would beate his offencelesse
5 1688 dogge, to affright an Imperious Lyon. Sue to
5 1689 him againe, and he's yours
5 1690 
5 1691    Cas. I will rather sue to be despis'd, then to deceiue
5 1692 so good a Commander, with so slight, so drunken, and so
5 1693 indiscreet an Officer. Drunke? And speake Parrat? And
5 1694 squabble? Swagger? Sweare? And discourse Fustian
5 1695 with ones owne shadow? Oh thou invisible spirit of
5 1696 Wine, if thou hast no name to be knowne by, let vs call
5 1697 thee Diuell
5 1698 
5 1699    Iago. What was he that you follow'd with your
5 1700 Sword? What had he done to you?
5 1701   Cas. I know not
5 1702 
5 1703    Iago. Is't possible?
5 1704   Cas. I remember a masse of things, but nothing distinctly:
5 1705 a Quarrell, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that
5 1706 men should put an Enemie in their mouthes, to steale away
5 1707 their Braines? that we should with ioy, pleasance,
5 1708 reuell and applause, transforme our selues into Beasts
5 1709 
5 1710    Iago. Why? But you are now well enough: how
5 1711 came you thus recouered?
5 1712   Cas. It hath pleas'd the diuell drunkennesse, to giue
5 1713 place to the diuell wrath, one vnperfectnesse, shewes me
5 1714 another to make me frankly despise my selfe
5 1715 
5 1716    Iago. Come, you are too seuere a Moraller. As the
5 1717 Time, the Place, & the Condition of this Country stands
5 1718 I could hartily wish this had not befalne: but since it is, as
5 1719 it is, mend it for your owne good
5 1720 
5 1721    Cas. I will aske him for my Place againe, he shall tell
5 1722 me, I am a drunkard: had I as many mouthes as Hydra,
5 1723 such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible
5 1724 man, by and by a Foole, and presently a Beast. Oh
5 1725 strange! Euery inordinate cup is vnbless'd, and the Ingredient
5 1726 is a diuell
5 1727 
5 1728    Iago. Come, come: good wine, is a good familiar
5 1729 Creature, if it be well vs'd: exclaime no more against it.
5 1730 And good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue
5 1731 you
5 1732 
5 1733    Cassio. I haue well approued it, Sir. I drunke?
5 1734   Iago. You, or any man liuing, may be drunke at a
5 1735 time man. I tell you what you shall do: Our General's
5 1736 Wife, is now the Generall. I may say so, in this respect,
5 1737 for that he hath deuoted, and giuen vp himselfe to the
5 1738 Contemplation, marke: and deuotement of her parts
5 1739 and Graces. Confesse your selfe freely to her: Importune
5 1740 her helpe to put you in your place againe. She is
5 1741 of so free, so kinde, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
5 1742 she holds it a vice in her goodnesse, not to do more
5 1743 then she is requested. This broken ioynt betweene
5 1744 you, and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my
5 1745 Fortunes against any lay worth naming, this cracke of
5 1746 your Loue, shall grow stronger, then it was before
5 1747 
5 1748    Cassio. You aduise me well
5 1749 
5 1750    Iago. I protest in the sinceritie of Loue, and honest
5 1751 kindnesse
5 1752 
5 1753    Cassio. I thinke it freely: and betimes in the morning,
5 1754 I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake
5 1755 for me: I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me
5 1756 
5 1757    Iago. You are in the right: good night Lieutenant, I
5 1758 must to the Watch
5 1759 
5 1760    Cassio. Good night, honest Iago.
5 1761 
5 1762 Exit Cassio.
5 1763 
5 1764   Iago. And what's he then,
5 1765 That saies I play the Villaine?
5 1766 When this aduise is free I giue, and honest,
5 1767 Proball to thinking, and indeed the course
5 1768 To win the Moore againe.
5 1769 For 'tis most easie
5 1770 Th' inclyning Desdemona to subdue
5 1771 In any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull
5 1772 As the free Elements. And then for her
5 1773 To win the Moore, were to renownce his Baptisme,
5 1774 All Seales, and Simbols of redeemed sin:
5 1775 His Soule is so enfetter'd to her Loue,
5 1776 That she may make, vnmake, do what she list,
5 1777 Euen as her Appetite shall play the God,
5 1778 With his weake Function. How am I then a Villaine,
5 1779 To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course,
5 1780 Directly to his good? Diuinitie of hell,
5 1781 When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on,
5 1782 They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes,
5 1783 As I do now. For whiles this honest Foole
5 1784 Plies Desdemona, to repaire his Fortune,
5 1785 And she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore,
5 1786 Ile powre this pestilence into his eare:
5 1787 That she repeales him, for her bodies Lust,
5 1788 And by how much she striues to do him good,
5 1789 She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore.
5 1790 So will I turne her vertue into pitch.
5 1791 And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net,
5 1792 That shall en-mash them all.
5 1793 How now Rodorigo?
5 1794 Enter Rodorigo.
5 1795 
5 1796   Rodorigo. I do follow heere in the Chace, not
5 1797 like a Hound that hunts, but one that filles vp the
5 1798 Crie. My Money is almost spent; I haue bin to night
5 1799 exceedingly well Cudgell'd: And I thinke the issue
5 1800 will bee, I shall haue so much experience for my paines;
5 1801 And so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, returne
5 1802 againe to Venice
5 1803 
5 1804    Iago. How poore are they that haue not Patience?
5 1805 What wound did euer heale but by degrees?
5 1806 Thou know'st we worke by Wit, and not by Witchcraft
5 1807 And Wit depends on dilatory time:
5 1808 Dos't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
5 1809 And thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd Cassio:
5 1810 Though other things grow faire against the Sun,
5 1811 Yet Fruites that blossome first, will first be ripe:
5 1812 Content thy selfe, a-while. Introth 'tis Morning;
5 1813 Pleasure, and Action, make the houres seeme short.
5 1814 Retire thee, go where thou art Billited:
5 1815 Away, I say, thou shalt know more heereafter:
5 1816 Nay get thee gone.
5 1817 
5 1818 Exit Roderigo.
5 1819 
5 1820 Two things are to be done:
5 1821 My Wife must moue for Cassio to her Mistris:
5 1822 Ile set her on my selfe, a while, to draw the Moor apart,
5 1823 And bring him iumpe, when he may Cassio finde
5 1824 Soliciting his wife: I, that's the way:
5 1825 Dull not Deuice, by coldnesse, and delay.
5 1826 Enter.
5 1827 
5 1828 
5 1829 Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.
5 1830 
5 1831 Enter Cassio, Musitians, and Clowne.
5 1832 
5 1833   Cassio. Masters, play heere, I wil content your paines,
5 1834 Something that's briefe: and bid, goodmorrow General
5 1835 
5 1836    Clo. Why Masters, haue your Instruments bin in Naples,
5 1837 that they speake i'th' Nose thus?
5 1838   Mus. How Sir? how?
5 1839   Clo. Are these I pray you, winde Instruments?
5 1840   Mus. I marry are they sir
5 1841 
5 1842    Clo. Oh, thereby hangs a tale
5 1843 
5 1844    Mus. Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
5 1845   Clow. Marry sir, by many a winde Instrument that I
5 1846 know. But Masters, heere's money for you: and the Generall
5 1847 so likes your Musick, that he desires you for loues
5 1848 sake to make no more noise with it
5 1849 
5 1850    Mus. Well Sir, we will not
5 1851 
5 1852    Clo. If you haue any Musicke that may not be heard,
5 1853 too't againe. But (as they say) to heare Musicke, the Generall
5 1854 do's not greatly care
5 1855 
5 1856    Mus. We haue none such, sir
5 1857 
5 1858    Clow. Then put vp your Pipes in your bagge, for Ile
5 1859 away. Go, vanish into ayre, away.
5 1860 
5 1861 Exit Mu.
5 1862 
5 1863   Cassio. Dost thou heare me, mine honest Friend?
5 1864   Clo. No, I heare not your honest Friend:
5 1865 I heare you
5 1866 
5 1867    Cassio. Prythee keepe vp thy Quillets, ther's a poore
5 1868 peece of Gold for thee: if the Gentlewoman that attends
5 1869 the Generall be stirring, tell her, there's one Cassio entreats
5 1870 her a little fauour of Speech. Wilt thou do this?
5 1871   Clo. She is stirring sir: if she will stirre hither, I shall
5 1872 seeme to notifie vnto her.
5 1873 
5 1874 Exit Clo.
5 1875 
5 1876 Enter Iago.
5 1877 
5 1878 In happy time, Iago
5 1879 
5 1880    Iago. You haue not bin a-bed then?
5 1881   Cassio. Why no: the day had broke before we parted.
5 1882 I haue made bold (Iago) to send in to your wife:
5 1883 My suite to her is, that she will to vertuous Desdemona
5 1884 Procure me some accesse
5 1885 
5 1886    Iago. Ile send her to you presently:
5 1887 And Ile deuise a meane to draw the Moore
5 1888 Out of the way, that your conuerse and businesse
5 1889 May be more free.
5 1890 
5 1891 Exit
5 1892 
5 1893   Cassio. I humbly thanke you for't. I neuer knew
5 1894 A Florentine more kinde, and honest.
5 1895 Enter aemilia.
5 1896 
5 1897 Aemil. Goodmorrow (good Lieutenant) I am sorrie
5 1898 For your displeasure: but all will sure be well.
5 1899 The Generall and his wife are talking of it,
5 1900 And she speakes for you stoutly. The Moore replies,
5 1901 That he you hurt is of great Fame in Cyprus,
5 1902 And great Affinitie: and that in wholsome Wisedome
5 1903 He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loues you
5 1904 And needs no other Suitor, but his likings
5 1905 To bring you in againe
5 1906 
5 1907    Cassio. Yet I beseech you,
5 1908 If you thinke fit, or that it may be done,
5 1909 Giue me aduantage of some breefe Discourse
5 1910 With Desdemon alone.
5 1911 Aemil. Pray you come in:
5 1912 I will bestow you where you shall haue time
5 1913 To speake your bosome freely
5 1914 
5 1915    Cassio. I am much bound to you.
5 1916 
5 1917 Scoena Secunda.
5 1918 
5 1919 Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.
5 1920 
5 1921   Othe. These Letters giue (Iago) to the Pylot,
5 1922 And by him do my duties to the Senate:
5 1923 That done, I will be walking on the Workes,
5 1924 Repaire there to mee
5 1925 
5 1926    Iago. Well, my good Lord, Ile doo't
5 1927 
5 1928    Oth. This Fortification (Gentlemen) shall we see't?
5 1929   Gent. Well waite vpon your Lordship.
5 1930 
5 1931 Exeunt.
5 1932 
5 1933 Scoena Tertia.
5 1934 
5 1935 Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and aemilia.
5 1936 
5 1937   Des. Be thou assur'd (good Cassio) I will do
5 1938 All my abilities in thy behalfe.
5 1939 Aemil. Good Madam do:
5 1940 I warrant it greeues my Husband,
5 1941 As if the cause were his
5 1942 
5 1943    Des. Oh that's an honest Fellow, Do not doubt Cassio
5 1944 But I will haue my Lord, and you againe
5 1945 As friendly as you were
5 1946 
5 1947    Cassio. Bounteous Madam,
5 1948 What euer shall become of Michael Cassio,
5 1949 He's neuer any thing but your true Seruant
5 1950 
5 1951    Des. I know't: I thanke you: you do loue my Lord:
5 1952 You haue knowne him long, and be you well assur'd
5 1953 He shall in strangenesse stand no farther off,
5 1954 Then in a politique distance
5 1955 
5 1956    Cassio. I, but Lady,
5 1957 That policie may either last so long,
5 1958 Or feede vpon such nice and waterish diet,
5 1959 Or breede it selfe so out of Circumstances,
5 1960 That I being absent, and my place supply'd,
5 1961 My Generall will forget my Loue, and Seruice
5 1962 
5 1963    Des. Do not doubt that: before aemilia here,
5 1964 I giue thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
5 1965 If I do vow a friendship, Ile performe it
5 1966 To the last Article. My Lord shall neuer rest,
5 1967 Ile watch him tame, and talke him out of patience;
5 1968 His Bed shall seeme a Schoole, his Boord a Shrift,
5 1969 Ile intermingle euery thing he do's
5 1970 With Cassio's suite: Therefore be merry Cassio,
5 1971 For thy Solicitor shall rather dye,
5 1972 Then giue thy cause away.
5 1973 Enter Othello, and Iago.
5 1974 
5 1975 Aemil. Madam, heere comes my Lord
5 1976 
5 1977    Cassio. Madam, Ile take my leaue
5 1978 
5 1979    Des. Why stay, and heare me speake
5 1980 
5 1981    Cassio. Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
5 1982 Vnfit for mine owne purposes
5 1983 
5 1984    Des. Well, do your discretion.
5 1985 
5 1986 Exit Cassio.
5 1987 
5 1988   Iago. Hah? I like not that
5 1989 
5 1990    Othel. What dost thou say?
5 1991   Iago. Nothing my Lord; or if- I know not what
5 1992 
5 1993    Othel. Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
5 1994   Iago. Cassio my Lord? No sure, I cannot thinke it
5 1995 That he would steale away so guilty-like,
5 1996 Seeing your comming
5 1997 
5 1998    Oth. I do beleeue 'twas he
5 1999 
5 2000    Des. How now my Lord?
5 2001 I haue bin talking with a Suitor heere,
5 2002 A man that languishes in your displeasure
5 2003 
5 2004    Oth. Who is't you meane?
5 2005   Des. Why your Lieutenant Cassio: Good my Lord,
5 2006 If I haue any grace, or power to moue you,
5 2007 His present reconciliation take.
5 2008 For if he be not one, that truly loues you,
5 2009 That erres in Ignorance, and not in Cunning,
5 2010 I haue no iudgement in an honest face.
5 2011 I prythee call him backe
5 2012 
5 2013    Oth. Went he hence now?
5 2014   Des. I sooth; so humbled,
5 2015 That he hath left part of his greefe with mee
5 2016 To suffer with him. Good Loue, call him backe
5 2017 
5 2018    Othel. Not now (sweet Desdemon) some other time
5 2019 
5 2020    Des. But shall't be shortly?
5 2021   Oth. The sooner (Sweet) for you
5 2022 
5 2023    Des. Shall't be to night, at Supper?
5 2024   Oth. No, not to night
5 2025 
5 2026    Des. To morrow Dinner then?
5 2027   Oth. I shall not dine at home:
5 2028 I meete the Captaines at the Cittadell
5 2029 
5 2030    Des. Why then to morrow night, on Tuesday morne,
5 2031 On Tuesday noone, or night; on Wensday Morne.
5 2032 I prythee name the time, but let it not
5 2033 Exceed three dayes. Infaith hee's penitent:
5 2034 And yet his Trespasse, in our common reason
5 2035 (Saue that they say the warres must make example)
5 2036 Out of her best, is not almost a fault
5 2037 T' encurre a priuate checke. When shall he come?
5 2038 Tell me Othello. I wonder in my Soule
5 2039 What you would aske me, that I should deny,
5 2040 Or stand so mam'ring on? What? Michael Cassio,
5 2041 That came a woing with you? and so many a time
5 2042 (When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly)
5 2043 Hath tane your part, to haue so much to do
5 2044 To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much
5 2045 
5 2046    Oth. Prythee no more: Let him come when he will:
5 2047 I will deny thee nothing
5 2048 
5 2049    Des. Why, this is not a Boone:
5 2050 'Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues,
5 2051 Or feede on nourishing dishes, or keepe you warme,
5 2052 Or sue to you, to do a peculiar profit
5 2053 To your owne person. Nay, when I haue a suite
5 2054 Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed,
5 2055 It shall be full of poize, and difficult waight,
5 2056 And fearefull to be granted
5 2057 
5 2058    Oth. I will deny thee nothing.
5 2059 Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
5 2060 To leaue me but a little to my selfe
5 2061 
5 2062    Des. Shall I deny you? No: farewell my Lord
5 2063 
5 2064    Oth. Farewell my Desdemona, Ile come to thee strait
5 2065 
5 2066    Des. aemilia come; be as your Fancies teach you:
5 2067 What ere you be, I am obedient.
5 2068 Enter.
5 2069 
5 2070   Oth. Excellent wretch: Perdition catch my Soule
5 2071 But I do loue thee: and when I loue thee not,
5 2072 Chaos is come againe
5 2073 
5 2074    Iago. My Noble Lord
5 2075 
5 2076    Oth. What dost thou say, Iago?
5 2077   Iago. Did Michael Cassio
5 2078 When he woo'd my Lady, know of your loue?
5 2079   Oth. He did, from first to last:
5 2080 Why dost thou aske?
5 2081   Iago. But for a satisfaction of my Thought,
5 2082 No further harme
5 2083 
5 2084    Oth. Why of thy thought, Iago?
5 2085   Iago. I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir
5 2086 
5 2087    Oth. O yes, and went betweene vs very oft
5 2088 
5 2089    Iago. Indeed?
5 2090   Oth. Indeed? I indeed. Discern'st thou ought in that?
5 2091 Is he not honest?
5 2092   Iago. Honest, my Lord?
5 2093   Oth. Honest? I, Honest
5 2094 
5 2095    Iago. My Lord, for ought I know
5 2096 
5 2097    Oth. What do'st thou thinke?
5 2098   Iago. Thinke, my Lord?
5 2099   Oth. Thinke, my Lord? Alas, thou ecchos't me;
5 2100 As if there were some Monster in thy thought
5 2101 Too hideous to be shewne. Thou dost mean somthing:
5 2102 I heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that,
5 2103 When Cassio left my wife. What didd'st not like?
5 2104 And when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile,
5 2105 Of my whole course of wooing; thou cried'st, Indeede?
5 2106 And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together,
5 2107 As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine
5 2108 Some horrible Conceite. If thou do'st loue me,
5 2109 Shew me thy thought
5 2110 
5 2111    Iago. My Lord, you know I loue you
5 2112 
5 2113    Oth. I thinke thou do'st:
5 2114 And for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie,
5 2115 And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,
5 2116 Therefore these stops of thine, fright me the more:
5 2117 For such things in a false disloyall Knaue
5 2118 Are trickes of Custome: but in a man that's iust,
5 2119 They're close dilations, working from the heart,
5 2120 That Passion cannot rule
5 2121 
5 2122    Iago. For Michael Cassio,
5 2123 I dare be sworne, I thinke that he is honest
5 2124 
5 2125    Oth. I thinke so too
5 2126 
5 2127    Iago. Men should be what they seeme,
5 2128 Or those that be not, would they might seeme none
5 2129 
5 2130    Oth. Certaine, men should be what they seeme
5 2131 
5 2132    Iago. Why then I thinke Cassio's an honest man
5 2133 
5 2134    Oth. Nay, yet there's more in this?
5 2135 I prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings,
5 2136 As thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts
5 2137 The worst of words
5 2138 
5 2139    Iago. Good my Lord pardon me,
5 2140 Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie,
5 2141 I am not bound to that: All Slaues are free:
5 2142 Vtter my Thoughts? Why say, they are vild, and falce?
5 2143 As where's that Palace, whereinto foule things
5 2144 Sometimes intrude not? Who ha's that breast so pure,
5 2145 Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions
5 2146 Keepe Leetes, and Law-dayes, and in Sessions sit
5 2147 With meditations lawfull?
5 2148   Oth. Thou do'st conspire against thy Friend (Iago)
5 2149 If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his eare
5 2150 A stranger to thy Thoughts
5 2151 
5 2152    Iago. I do beseech you,
5 2153 Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse
5 2154 (As I confesse it is my Natures plague
5 2155 To spy into Abuses, and of my iealousie
5 2156 Shapes faults that are not) that your wisedome
5 2157 From one, that so imperfectly conceits,
5 2158 Would take no notice, nor build your selfe a trouble
5 2159 Out of his scattering, and vnsure obseruance:
5 2160 It were not for your quiet, nor your good,
5 2161 Nor for my Manhood, Honesty, and Wisedome,
5 2162 To let you know my thoughts
5 2163 
5 2164    Oth. What dost thou meane?
5 2165   Iago. Good name in Man, & woman (deere my Lord)
5 2166 Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules;
5 2167 Who steales my purse, steales trash:
5 2168 'Tis something, nothing;
5 2169 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has bin slaue to thousands:
5 2170 But he that filches from me my good Name,
5 2171 Robs me of that, which not enriches him,
5 2172 And makes me poore indeed
5 2173 
5 2174    Oth. Ile know thy Thoughts
5 2175 
5 2176    Iago. You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,
5 2177 Nor shall not, whil'st 'tis in my custodie
5 2178 
5 2179    Oth. Ha?
5 2180   Iago. Oh, beware my Lord, of iealousie,
5 2181 It is the greene-ey'd Monster, which doth mocke
5 2182 The meate it feeds on. That Cuckold liues in blisse,
5 2183 Who certaine of his Fate, loues not his wronger:
5 2184 But oh, what damned minutes tels he ore,
5 2185 Who dotes, yet doubts: Suspects, yet soundly loues?
5 2186   Oth. O miserie
5 2187 
5 2188    Iago. Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough,
5 2189 But Riches finelesse, is as poore as Winter,
5 2190 To him that euer feares he shall be poore:
5 2191 Good Heauen, the Soules of all my Tribe defend
5 2192 From Iealousie
5 2193 
5 2194    Oth. Why? why is this?
5 2195 Think'st thou, I'ld make a Life of Iealousie;
5 2196 To follow still the changes of the Moone
5 2197 With fresh suspitions? No: to be once in doubt,
5 2198 Is to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat,
5 2199 When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule
5 2200 To such exufflicate, and blow'd Surmises,
5 2201 Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me Iealious,
5 2202 To say my wife is faire, feeds well, loues company,
5 2203 Is free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances:
5 2204 Where Vertue is, these are more vertuous.
5 2205 Nor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw
5 2206 The smallest feare, or doubt of her reuolt,
5 2207 For she had eyes, and chose me. No Iago,
5 2208 Ile see before I doubt; when I doubt, proue;
5 2209 And on the proofe, there is no more but this,
5 2210 Away at once with Loue, or Iealousie
5 2211 
5 2212    Ia. I am glad of this: For now I shall haue reason
5 2213 To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you
5 2214 With franker spirit. Therefore (as I am bound)
5 2215 Receiue it from me. I speake not yet of proofe:
5 2216 Looke to your wife, obserue her well with Cassio,
5 2217 Weare your eyes, thus: not Iealious, nor Secure:
5 2218 I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature,
5 2219 Out of selfe-Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't:
5 2220 I know our Country disposition well:
5 2221 In Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes
5 2222 They dare not shew their Husbands.
5 2223 Their best Conscience,
5 2224 Is not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne
5 2225 
5 2226    Oth. Dost thou say so?
5 2227   Iago. She did deceiue her Father, marrying you,
5 2228 And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes,
5 2229 She lou'd them most
5 2230 
5 2231    Oth. And so she did
5 2232 
5 2233    Iago. Why go too then:
5 2234 Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming
5 2235 To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake,
5 2236 He thought 'twas Witchcraft.
5 2237 But I am much too blame:
5 2238 I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
5 2239 For too much louing you
5 2240 
5 2241    Oth. I am bound to thee for euer
5 2242 
5 2243    Iago. I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits:
5 2244   Oth. Not a iot, not a iot
5 2245 
5 2246    Iago. Trust me, I feare it has:
5 2247 I hope you will consider what is spoke
5 2248 Comes from your Loue.
5 2249 But I do see y'are moou'd:
5 2250 I am to pray you, not to straine my speech
5 2251 To grosser issues, nor to larger reach,
5 2252 Then to Suspition
5 2253 
5 2254    Oth. I will not
5 2255 
5 2256    Iago. Should you do so (my Lord)
5 2257 My speech should fall into such vilde successe,
5 2258 Which my Thoughts aym'd not.
5 2259 Cassio's my worthy Friend:
5 2260 My Lord, I see y'are mou'd
5 2261 
5 2262    Oth. No, not much mou'd:
5 2263 I do not thinke but Desdemona's honest
5 2264 
5 2265    Iago. Long liue she so;
5 2266 And long liue you to thinke so
5 2267 
5 2268    Oth. And yet how Nature erring from it selfe
5 2269 
5 2270    Iago. I, there's the point:
5 2271 As (to be bold with you)
5 2272 Not to affect many proposed Matches
5 2273 Of her owne Clime, Complexion, and Degree,
5 2274 Whereto we see in all things, Nature tends:
5 2275 Foh, one may smel in such, a will most ranke,
5 2276 Foule disproportions, Thoughts vnnaturall.
5 2277 But (pardon me) I do not in position
5 2278 Distinctly speake of her, though I may feare
5 2279 Her will, recoyling to her better iudgement,
5 2280 May fal to match you with her Country formes,
5 2281 And happily repent
5 2282 
5 2283    Oth. Farewell, farewell:
5 2284 If more thou dost perceiue, let me know more:
5 2285 Set on thy wife to obserue.
5 2286 Leaue me Iago
5 2287 
5 2288    Iago. My Lord, I take my leaue
5 2289 
5 2290    Othel. Why did I marry?
5 2291 This honest Creature (doubtlesse)
5 2292 Sees, and knowes more, much more then he vnfolds
5 2293 
5 2294    Iago. My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor
5 2295 To scan this thing no farther: Leaue it to time,
5 2296 Although 'tis fit that Cassio haue his Place;
5 2297 For sure he filles it vp with great Ability;
5 2298 Yet if you please, to him off a-while:
5 2299 You shall by that perceiue him, and his meanes:
5 2300 Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment
5 2301 With any strong, or vehement importunitie,
5 2302 Much will be seene in that: In the meane time,
5 2303 Let me be thought too busie in my feares,
5 2304 (As worthy cause I haue to feare I am)
5 2305 And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor
5 2306 
5 2307    Oth. Feare not my gouernment
5 2308 
5 2309    Iago. I once more take my leaue.
5 2310 Enter.
5 2311 
5 2312   Oth. This Fellow's of exceeding honesty,
5 2313 And knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit
5 2314 Of humane dealings. If I do proue her Haggard,
5 2315 Though that her Iesses were my deere heart-strings,
5 2316 I'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde
5 2317 To prey at Fortune. Haply, for I am blacke,
5 2318 And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation
5 2319 That Chamberers haue: Or for I am declin'd
5 2320 Into the vale of yeares (yet that's not much)
5 2321 Shee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe
5 2322 Must be to loath her. Oh Curse of Marriage!
5 2323 That we can call these delicate Creatures ours,
5 2324 And not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad,
5 2325 And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon,
5 2326 Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue
5 2327 For others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great-ones,
5 2328 Prerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base,
5 2329 'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death:
5 2330 Euen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs,
5 2331 When we do quicken. Looke where she comes:
5 2332 Enter Desdemona and aemilia.
5 2333 
5 2334 If she be false, Heauen mock'd it selfe:
5 2335 Ile not beleeue't
5 2336 
5 2337    Des. How now, my deere Othello?
5 2338 Your dinner, and the generous Islanders
5 2339 By you inuited, do attend your presence
5 2340 
5 2341    Oth. I am too blame
5 2342 
5 2343    Des. Why do you speake so faintly?
5 2344 Are you not well?
5 2345   Oth. I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere
5 2346 
5 2347    Des. Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe.
5 2348 Let me but binde it hard, within this houre
5 2349 It will be well
5 2350 
5 2351    Oth. Your Napkin is too little:
5 2352 Let it alone: Come, Ile go in with you.
5 2353 Enter.
5 2354 
5 2355   Des. I am very sorry that you are not well.
5 2356 Aemil. I am glad I haue found this Napkin:
5 2357 This was her first remembrance from the Moore,
5 2358 My wayward Husband hath a hundred times
5 2359 Woo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token,
5 2360 (For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it)
5 2361 That she reserues it euermore about her,
5 2362 To kisse, and talke too. Ile haue the worke tane out,
5 2363 And giu't Iago: what he will do with it
5 2364 Heauen knowes, not I:
5 2365 I nothing, but to please his Fantasie.
5 2366 Enter Iago.
5 2367 
5 2368   Iago. How now? What do you heere alone?
5 2369 Aemil. Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you
5 2370 
5 2371    Iago. You haue a thing for me?
5 2372 It is a common thing-
5 2373 Aemil. Hah?
5 2374   Iago. To haue a foolish wife.
5 2375 Aemil. Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now
5 2376 For that same Handkerchiefe
5 2377 
5 2378    Iago. What Handkerchiefe?
5 2379 Aemil. What Handkerchiefe?
5 2380 Why that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona,
5 2381 That which so often you did bid me steale
5 2382 
5 2383    Iago. Hast stolne it from her?
5 2384 Aemil. No: but she let it drop by negligence,
5 2385 And to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp:
5 2386 Looke, heere 'tis
5 2387 
5 2388    Iago. A good wench, giue it me.
5 2389 Aemil. What will you do with't, that you haue bene
5 2390 so earnest to haue me filch it?
5 2391   Iago. Why, what is that to you?
5 2392 Aemil. If it be not for some purpose of import,
5 2393 Giu't me againe. Poore Lady, shee'l run mad
5 2394 When she shall lacke it
5 2395 
5 2396    Iago. Be not acknowne on't:
5 2397 I haue vse for it. Go, leaue me.
5 2398 
5 2399 Exit aemil.
5 2400 
5 2401 I will in Cassio's Lodging loose this Napkin,
5 2402 And let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre,
5 2403 Are to the iealious, confirmations strong,
5 2404 As proofes of holy Writ. This may do something.
5 2405 The Moore already changes with my poyson:
5 2406 Dangerous conceites, are in their Natures poysons,
5 2407 Which at the first are scarse found to distaste:
5 2408 But with a little acte vpon the blood,
5 2409 Burne like the Mines of Sulphure. I did say so.
5 2410 Enter Othello.
5 2411 
5 2412 Looke where he comes: Not Poppy, nor Mandragora,
5 2413 Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world
5 2414 Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe
5 2415 Which thou owd'st yesterday
5 2416 
5 2417    Oth. Ha, ha, false to mee?
5 2418   Iago. Why how now Generall? No more of that
5 2419 
5 2420    Oth. Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke:
5 2421 I sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd,
5 2422 Then but to know't a little
5 2423 
5 2424    Iago. How now, my Lord?
5 2425   Oth. What sense had I, in her stolne houres of Lust?
5 2426 I saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me:
5 2427 I slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie.
5 2428 I found not Cassio's kisses on her Lippes:
5 2429 He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolne,
5 2430 Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all
5 2431 
5 2432    Iago. I am sorry to heare this?
5 2433   Oth. I had beene happy, if the generall Campe,
5 2434 Pyoners and all, had tasted her sweet Body,
5 2435 So I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer
5 2436 Farewell the Tranquill minde; farewell Content;
5 2437 Farewell the plumed Troopes, and the bigge Warres,
5 2438 That makes Ambition, Vertue! Oh farewell,
5 2439 Farewell the neighing Steed, and the shrill Trumpe,
5 2440 The Spirit-stirring Drum, th' Eare-piercing Fife,
5 2441 The Royall Banner, and all Qualitie,
5 2442 Pride, Pompe, and Circumstance of glorious Warre:
5 2443 And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates
5 2444 Th' immortall Ioues dread Clamours, counterfet,
5 2445 Farewell: Othello's Occupation's gone
5 2446 
5 2447    Iago. Is't possible my Lord?
5 2448   Oth. Villaine, be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore;
5 2449 Be sure of it: Giue me the Occular proofe,
5 2450 Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule,
5 2451 Thou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog
5 2452 Then answer my wak'd wrath
5 2453 
5 2454    Iago. Is't come to this?
5 2455   Oth. Make me to see't: or (at the least) so proue it,
5 2456 That the probation beare no Hindge, nor Loope,
5 2457 To hang a doubt on: Or woe vpon thy life
5 2458 
5 2459    Iago. My Noble Lord
5 2460 
5 2461    Oth. If thou dost slander her, and torture me,
5 2462 Neuer pray more: Abandon all remorse
5 2463 On Horrors head, Horrors accumulate:
5 2464 Do deeds to make Heauen weepe, all Earth amaz'd;
5 2465 For nothing canst thou to damnation adde,
5 2466 Greater then that
5 2467 
5 2468    Iago. O Grace! O Heauen forgiue me!
5 2469 Are you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense?
5 2470 God buy you: take mine Office. Oh wretched Foole,
5 2471 That lou'st to make thine Honesty, a Vice!
5 2472 Oh monstrous world! Take note, take note (O World)
5 2473 To be direct and honest, is not safe.
5 2474 I thanke you for this profit, and from hence
5 2475 Ile loue no Friend, sith Loue breeds such offence
5 2476 
5 2477    Oth. Nay stay: thou should'st be honest
5 2478 
5 2479    Iago. I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole,
5 2480 And looses that it workes for
5 2481 
5 2482    Oth. By the World,
5 2483 I thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not:
5 2484 I thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not:
5 2485 Ile haue some proofe. My name that was as fresh
5 2486 As Dians Visage, is now begrim'd and blacke
5 2487 As mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues,
5 2488 Poyson, or Fire, or suffocating streames,
5 2489 Ile not indure it. Would I were satisfied
5 2490 
5 2491    Iago. I see you are eaten vp with Passion:
5 2492 I do repent me, that I put it to you.
5 2493 You would be satisfied?
5 2494   Oth. Would? Nay, and I will
5 2495 
5 2496    Iago. And may: but how? How satisfied, my Lord?
5 2497 Would you the super-vision grossely gape on?
5 2498 Behold her top'd?
5 2499   Oth. Death, and damnation. Oh!
5 2500   Iago. It were a tedious difficulty, I thinke,
5 2501 To bring them to that Prospect: Damne them then,
5 2502 If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster
5 2503 More then their owne. What then? How then?
5 2504 What shall I say? Where's Satisfaction?
5 2505 It is impossible you should see this,
5 2506 Were they as prime as Goates, as hot as Monkeyes,
5 2507 As salt as Wolues in pride, and Fooles as grosse
5 2508 As Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say,
5 2509 If imputation, and strong circumstances,
5 2510 Which leade directly to the doore of Truth,
5 2511 Will giue you satisfaction, you might haue't
5 2512 
5 2513    Oth. Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall
5 2514 
5 2515    Iago. I do not like the Office.
5 2516 But sith I am entred in this cause so farre
5 2517 (Prick'd too't by foolish Honesty, and Loue)
5 2518 I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,
5 2519 And being troubled with a raging tooth,
5 2520 I could not sleepe. There are a kinde of men,
5 2521 So loose of Soule, that in their sleepes will mutter
5 2522 Their Affayres: one of this kinde is Cassio:
5 2523 In sleepe I heard him say, sweet Desdemona,
5 2524 Let vs be wary, let vs hide our Loues,
5 2525 And then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand:
5 2526 Cry, oh sweet Creature: then kisse me hard,
5 2527 As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes,
5 2528 That grew vpon my lippes, laid his Leg ore my Thigh,
5 2529 And sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate,
5 2530 That gaue thee to the Moore
5 2531 
5 2532    Oth. O monstrous! monstrous!
5 2533   Iago. Nay, this was but his Dreame
5 2534 
5 2535    Oth. But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion,
5 2536 'Tis a shrew'd doubt, though it be but a Dreame
5 2537 
5 2538    Iago. And this may helpe to thicken other proofes,
5 2539 That do demonstrate thinly
5 2540 
5 2541    Oth. Ile teare her all to peeces
5 2542 
5 2543    Iago. Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done,
5 2544 She may be honest yet: Tell me but this,
5 2545 Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe
5 2546 Spotted with Strawberries, in your wiues hand?
5 2547   Oth. I gaue her such a one: 'twas my first gift
5 2548 
5 2549    Iago. I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe
5 2550 (I am sure it was your wiues) did I to day
5 2551 See Cassio wipe his Beard with
5 2552 
5 2553    Oth. If it be that
5 2554 
5 2555    Iago. If it be that, or any, it was here.
5 2556 It speakes against her with the other proofes
5 2557 
5 2558    Othel. O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues:
5 2559 One is too poore, too weake for my reuenge.
5 2560 Now do I see 'tis true. Looke heere Iago,
5 2561 All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone.
5 2562 Arise blacke vengeance, from the hollow hell,
5 2563 Yeeld vp (O Loue) thy Crowne, and hearted Throne
5 2564 To tyrannous Hate. Swell bosome with thy fraught,
5 2565 For 'tis of Aspickes tongues
5 2566 
5 2567    Iago. Yet be content
5 2568 
5 2569    Oth. Oh blood, blood, blood
5 2570 
5 2571    Iago. Patience I say: your minde may change
5 2572 
5 2573    Oth. Neuer Iago. Like to the Ponticke Sea,
5 2574 Whose Icie Current, and compulsiue course,
5 2575 Neu'r keepes retyring ebbe, but keepes due on
5 2576 To the Proponticke, and the Hellespont:
5 2577 Euen so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace
5 2578 Shall neu'r looke backe, neu'r ebbe to humble Loue,
5 2579 Till that a capeable, and wide Reuenge
5 2580 Swallow them vp. Now by yond Marble Heauen,
5 2581 In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow,
5 2582 I heere engage my words
5 2583 
5 2584    Iago. Do not rise yet:
5 2585 Witnesse you euer-burning Lights aboue,
5 2586 You Elements, that clip vs round about,
5 2587 Witnesse that heere Iago doth giue vp
5 2588 The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
5 2589 To wrong'd Othello's Seruice. Let him command,
5 2590 And to obey shall be in me remorse,
5 2591 What bloody businesse euer
5 2592 
5 2593    Oth. I greet thy loue,
5 2594 Not with vaine thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
5 2595 And will vpon the instant put thee too't.
5 2596 Within these three dayes let me heare thee say,
5 2597 That Cassio's not aliue
5 2598 
5 2599    Iago. My Friend is dead:
5 2600 'Tis done at your Request.
5 2601 But let her liue
5 2602 
5 2603    Oth. Damne her lewde Minx:
5 2604 O damne her, damne her.
5 2605 Come go with me a-part, I will withdraw
5 2606 To furnish me with some swift meanes of death
5 2607 For the faire Diuell.
5 2608 Now art thou my Lieutenant
5 2609 
5 2610    Iago. I am your owne for euer.
5 2611 
5 2612 Exeunt.
5 2613 
5 2614 
5 2615 Scaena Quarta.
5 2616 
5 2617 Enter Desdemona, aemilia, and Clown.
5 2618 
5 2619   Des. Do you know Sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio
5 2620 lyes?
5 2621   Clow. I dare not say he lies any where
5 2622 
5 2623    Des. Why man?
5 2624   Clo. He's a Soldier, and for me to say a Souldier lyes,
5 2625 'tis stabbing
5 2626 
5 2627    Des. Go too: where lodges he?
5 2628   Clo. To tell you where he lodges, is to tel you where
5 2629 I lye
5 2630 
5 2631    Des. Can any thing be made of this?
5 2632   Clo. I know not where he lodges, and for mee to deuise
5 2633 a lodging, and say he lies heere, or he lies there, were
5 2634 to lye in mine owne throat
5 2635 
5 2636    Des. Can you enquire him out? and be edified by report?
5 2637   Clo. I will Catechize the world for him, that is, make
5 2638 Questions, and by them answer
5 2639 
5 2640    Des. Seeke him, bidde him come hither: tell him, I
5 2641 haue moou'd my Lord on his behalfe, and hope all will
5 2642 be well
5 2643 
5 2644    Clo. To do this, is within the compasse of mans Wit,
5 2645 and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
5 2646 
5 2647 Exit Clo.
5 2648 
5 2649   Des. Where should I loose the Handkerchiefe, aemilia?
5 2650 Aemil. I know not Madam
5 2651 
5 2652    Des. Beleeue me, I had rather haue lost my purse
5 2653 Full of Cruzadoes. And but my Noble Moore
5 2654 Is true of minde, and made of no such basenesse,
5 2655 As iealious Creatures are, it were enough
5 2656 To put him to ill-thinking.
5 2657 Aemil. Is he not iealious?
5 2658   Des. Who, he? I thinke the Sun where he was borne,
5 2659 Drew all such humors from him.
5 2660 Aemil. Looke where he comes.
5 2661 Enter Othello.
5 2662 
5 2663   Des. I will not leaue him now, till Cassio be
5 2664 Call'd to him. How is't with you, my Lord?
5 2665   Oth. Well my good Lady. Oh hardnes to dissemble!
5 2666 How do you, Desdemona?
5 2667   Des. Well, my good Lord
5 2668 
5 2669    Oth. Giue me your hand.
5 2670 This hand is moist, my Lady
5 2671 
5 2672    Des. It hath felt no age, nor knowne no sorrow
5 2673 
5 2674    Oth. This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart:
5 2675 Hot, hot, and moyst. This hand of yours requires
5 2676 A sequester from Liberty: Fasting, and Prayer,
5 2677 Much Castigation, Exercise deuout,
5 2678 For heere's a yong, and sweating Diuell heere
5 2679 That commonly rebels: 'Tis a good hand,
5 2680 A franke one
5 2681 
5 2682    Des. You may (indeed) say so:
5 2683 For 'twas that hand that gaue away my heart
5 2684 
5 2685    Oth. A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands:
5 2686 But our new Heraldry is hands, not hearts
5 2687 
5 2688    Des. I cannot speake of this:
5 2689 Come, now your promise
5 2690 
5 2691    Oth. What promise, Chucke?
5 2692   Des. I haue sent to bid Cassio come speake with you
5 2693 
5 2694    Oth. I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me:
5 2695 Lend me thy Handkerchiefe
5 2696 
5 2697    Des. Heere my Lord
5 2698 
5 2699    Oth. That which I gaue you
5 2700 
5 2701    Des. I haue it not about me
5 2702 
5 2703    Oth. Not?
5 2704   Des. No indeed, my Lord
5 2705 
5 2706    Oth. That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe
5 2707 Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue:
5 2708 She was a Charmer, and could almost read
5 2709 The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,
5 2710 'T would make her Amiable, and subdue my Father
5 2711 Intirely to her loue: But if she lost it,
5 2712 Or made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye
5 2713 Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt
5 2714 After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me,
5 2715 And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd)
5 2716 To giue it her. I did so; and take heede on't,
5 2717 Make it a Darling, like your precious eye:
5 2718 To loose't, or giue't away, were such perdition,
5 2719 As nothing else could match
5 2720 
5 2721    Des. Is't possible?
5 2722   Oth. 'Tis true: There's Magicke in the web of it:
5 2723 A Sybill that had numbred in the world
5 2724 The Sun to course, two hundred compasses,
5 2725 In her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke:
5 2726 The Wormes were hallowed, that did breede the Silke,
5 2727 And it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull
5 2728 Conseru'd of Maidens hearts
5 2729 
5 2730    Des. Indeed? Is't true?
5 2731   Oth. Most veritable, therefore looke too't well
5 2732 
5 2733    Des. Then would to Heauen, that I had neuer seene't?
5 2734   Oth. Ha? wherefore?
5 2735   Des. Why do you speake so startingly, and rash?
5 2736   Oth. Is't lost? Is't gon? Speak, is't out o'th' way?
5 2737   Des. Blesse vs
5 2738 
5 2739    Oth. Say you?
5 2740   Des. It is not lost: but what and if it were?
5 2741   Oth. How?
5 2742   Des. I say it is not lost
5 2743 
5 2744    Oth. Fetcht, let me see't
5 2745 
5 2746    Des. Why so I can: but I will not now:
5 2747 This is a tricke to put me from my suite,
5 2748 Pray you let Cassio be receiu'd againe
5 2749 
5 2750    Oth. Fetch me the Handkerchiefe,
5 2751 My minde mis-giues
5 2752 
5 2753    Des. Come, come: you'l neuer meete a more sufficient
5 2754 man
5 2755 
5 2756    Oth. The Handkerchiefe
5 2757 
5 2758    Des. A man that all his time
5 2759 Hath founded his good Fortunes on your loue;
5 2760 Shar'd dangers with you
5 2761 
5 2762    Oth. The Handkerchiefe
5 2763 
5 2764    Des. Insooth, you are too blame
5 2765 
5 2766    Oth. Away.
5 2767 
5 2768 Exit Othello.
5 2769 
5 2770 Aemil. Is not this man iealious?
5 2771   Des. I neu'r saw this before.
5 2772 Sure, there's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe,
5 2773 I am most vnhappy in the losse of it.
5 2774 Aemil. 'Tis not a yeare or two shewes vs a man:
5 2775 They are all but Stomackes, and we all but Food,
5 2776 They eate vs hungerly, and when they are full
5 2777 They belch vs.
5 2778 Enter Iago, and Cassio.
5 2779 
5 2780 Looke you, Cassio and my Husband
5 2781 
5 2782    Iago. There is no other way: 'tis she must doo't:
5 2783 And loe the happinesse: go, and importune her
5 2784 
5 2785    Des. How now (good Cassio) what's the newes with
5 2786 you?
5 2787   Cassio. Madam, my former suite. I do beseech you,
5 2788 That by your vertuous meanes, I may againe
5 2789 Exist, and be a member of his loue,
5 2790 Whom I, with all the Office of my heart
5 2791 Intirely honour, I would not be delayd.
5 2792 If my offence, be of such mortall kinde,
5 2793 That nor my Seruice past, nor present Sorrowes,
5 2794 Nor purpos'd merit in futurity,
5 2795 Can ransome me into his loue againe,
5 2796 But to know so, must be my benefit:
5 2797 So shall I cloath me in a forc'd content,
5 2798 And shut my selfe vp in some other course
5 2799 To Fortunes Almes
5 2800 
5 2801    Des. Alas (thrice-gentle Cassio)
5 2802 My Aduocation is not now in Tune;
5 2803 My Lord, is not my Lord; nor should I know him,
5 2804 Were he in Fauour, as in Humour alter'd.
5 2805 So helpe me euery spirit sanctified,
5 2806 As I haue spoken for you all my best,
5 2807 And stood within the blanke of his displeasure
5 2808 For my free speech. You must awhile be patient:
5 2809 What I can do, I will: and more I will
5 2810 Then for my selfe, I dare. Let that suffice you
5 2811 
5 2812    Iago. Is my Lord angry?
5 2813 Aemil. He went hence but now:
5 2814 And certainly in strange vnquietnesse
5 2815 
5 2816    Iago. Can he be angry? I haue seen the Cannon
5 2817 When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre,
5 2818 And like the Diuell from his very Arme
5 2819 Puff't his owne Brother: And is he angry?
5 2820 Something of moment then: I will go meet him,
5 2821 There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.
5 2822 
5 2823 Exit
5 2824 
5 2825   Des. I prythee do so. Something sure of State,
5 2826 Either from Venice, or some vnhatch'd practise
5 2827 Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus, to him,
5 2828 Hath pudled his cleare Spirit: and in such cases,
5 2829 Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things,
5 2830 Though great ones are their obiect. 'Tis euen so.
5 2831 For let our finger ake, and it endues
5 2832 Our other healthfull members, euen to a sense
5 2833 Of paine. Nay, we must thinke men are not Gods,
5 2834 Nor of them looke for such obseruancie
5 2835 As fits the Bridall. Beshrew me much, aemilia,
5 2836 I was (vnhandsome Warrior, as I am)
5 2837 Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule:
5 2838 But now I finde, I had suborn'd the Witnesse,
5 2839 And he's Indited falsely.
5 2840 Aemil. Pray heauen it bee
5 2841 State matters, as you thinke, and no Conception,
5 2842 Nor no Iealious Toy, concerning you
5 2843 
5 2844    Des. Alas the day, I neuer gaue him cause.
5 2845 Aemil. But Iealious soules will not be answer'd so;
5 2846 They are not euer iealious for the cause,
5 2847 But iealious, for they're iealious. It is a Monster
5 2848 Begot vpon it selfe, borne on it selfe
5 2849 
5 2850    Des. Heauen keepe the Monster from Othello's mind.
5 2851 Aemil. Lady, Amen
5 2852 
5 2853    Des. I will go seeke him. Cassio, walke heere about:
5 2854 If I doe finde him fit, Ile moue your suite,
5 2855 And seeke to effect it to my vttermost.
5 2856 
5 2857 Exit
5 2858 
5 2859   Cas. I humbly thanke your Ladyship.
5 2860 Enter Bianca.
5 2861 
5 2862   Bian. 'Saue you (Friend Cassio.)
5 2863   Cassio. What make you from home?
5 2864 How is't with you, my most faire Bianca?
5 2865 Indeed (sweet Loue) I was comming to your house
5 2866 
5 2867    Bian. And I was going to your Lodging, Cassio.
5 2868 What? keepe a weeke away? Seuen dayes, and Nights?
5 2869 Eight score eight houres? And Louers absent howres
5 2870 More tedious then the Diall, eight score times?
5 2871 Oh weary reck'ning
5 2872 
5 2873    Cassio. Pardon me, Bianca:
5 2874 I haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest,
5 2875 But I shall in a more continuate time
5 2876 Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca
5 2877 Take me this worke out
5 2878 
5 2879    Bianca. Oh Cassio, whence came this?
5 2880 This is some Token from a newer Friend,
5 2881 To the felt-Absence: now I feele a Cause:
5 2882 Is't come to this? Well, well
5 2883 
5 2884    Cassio. Go too, woman:
5 2885 Throw your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth,
5 2886 From whence you haue them. You are iealious now,
5 2887 That this is from some Mistris, some remembrance;
5 2888 No, in good troth Bianca
5 2889 
5 2890    Bian. Why, who's is it?
5 2891   Cassio. I know not neither:
5 2892 I found it in my Chamber,
5 2893 I like the worke well; Ere it be demanded
5 2894 (As like enough it will) I would haue it coppied:
5 2895 Take it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time
5 2896 
5 2897    Bian. Leaue you? Wherefore?
5 2898   Cassio. I do attend heere on the Generall,
5 2899 And thinke it no addition, nor my wish
5 2900 To haue him see me woman'd
5 2901 
5 2902    Bian. Why, I pray you?
5 2903   Cassio. Not that I loue you not
5 2904 
5 2905    Bian. But that you do not loue me.
5 2906 I pray you bring me on the way a little,
5 2907 And say, if I shall see you soone at night?
5 2908   Cassio. 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
5 2909 For I attend heere: But Ile see you soone
5 2910 
5 2911    Bian. 'Tis very good: I must be circumstanc'd.
5 2912 
5 2913 Exeunt. omnes.
5 2914 
5 2915 
5 2916 Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.
5 2917 
5 2918 Enter Othello, and Iago.
5 2919 
5 2920   Iago. Will you thinke so?
5 2921   Oth. Thinke so, Iago?
5 2922   Iago. What, to kisse in priuate?
5 2923   Oth. An vnauthoriz'd kisse?
5 2924   Iago. Or to be naked with her Friend in bed,
5 2925 An houre, or more, not meaning any harme?
5 2926   Oth. Naked in bed (Iago) and not meane harme?
5 2927 It is hypocrisie against the Diuell:
5 2928 They that meane vertuously, and yet do so,
5 2929 The Diuell their vertue tempts, and they tempt Heauen
5 2930 
5 2931    Iago. If they do nothing, 'tis a Veniall slip:
5 2932 But if I giue my wife a Handkerchiefe
5 2933 
5 2934    Oth. What then?
5 2935   Iago. Why then 'tis hers (my Lord) and being hers,
5 2936 She may (I thinke) bestow't on any man
5 2937 
5 2938    Oth. She is Protectresse of her honor too:
5 2939 May she giue that?
5 2940   Iago. Her honor is an Essence that's not seene,
5 2941 They haue it very oft, that haue it not.
5 2942 But for the Handkerchiefe
5 2943 
5 2944    Othe. By heauen, I would most gladly haue forgot it:
5 2945 Thou saidst (oh, it comes ore my memorie,
5 2946 As doth the Rauen o're the infectious house:
5 2947 Boading to all) he had my Handkerchiefe
5 2948 
5 2949    Iago . I: what of that?
5 2950   Othe. That's not so good now
5 2951 
5 2952    Iag. What if I had said, I had seene him do you wrong?
5 2953 Or heard him say (as Knaues be such abroad,
5 2954 Who hauing by their owne importunate suit,
5 2955 Or voluntary dotage of some Mistris,
5 2956 Conuinced or supply'd them, cannot chuse
5 2957 But they must blab.)
5 2958   Oth. Hath he said any thing?
5 2959   Iago. He hath (my Lord) but be you well assur'd,
5 2960 No more then he'le vn-sweare
5 2961 
5 2962    Oth. What hath he said?
5 2963   Iago. Why, that he did: I know not what he did
5 2964 
5 2965    Othe. What? What?
5 2966   Iago. Lye
5 2967 
5 2968    Oth. With her?
5 2969   Iago. With her? On her: what you will
5 2970 
5 2971    Othe. Lye with her? lye on her? We say lye on her,
5 2972 when they be-lye-her. Lye with her: that's fullsome:
5 2973 Handkerchiefe: Confessions: Handkerchiefe. To confesse,
5 2974 and be hang'd for his labour. First, to be hang'd,
5 2975 and then to confesse: I tremble at it. Nature would not
5 2976 inuest her selfe in such shadowing passion, without some
5 2977 Instruction. It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish)
5 2978 Noses, Eares, and Lippes: is't possible. Confesse? Handkerchiefe?
5 2979 O diuell.
5 2980 
5 2981 Falls in a Traunce.
5 2982 
5 2983   Iago. Worke on,
5 2984 My Medicine workes. Thus credulous Fooles are caught,
5 2985 And many worthy, and chast Dames euen thus,
5 2986 (All guiltlesse) meete reproach: what hoa? My Lord?
5 2987 My Lord, I say: Othello.
5 2988 Enter Cassio.
5 2989 
5 2990 How now Cassio?
5 2991   Cas. What's the matter?
5 2992   Iago. My Lord is falne into an Epilepsie,
5 2993 This is his second Fit: he had one yesterday
5 2994 
5 2995    Cas. Rub him about the Temples
5 2996 
5 2997    Iago. The Lethargie must haue his quyet course:
5 2998 If not, he foames at mouth: and by and by
5 2999 Breakes out to sauage madnesse. Looke, he stirres:
5 3000 Do you withdraw your selfe a little while,
5 3001 He will recouer straight: when he is gone,
5 3002 I would on great occasion, speake with you.
5 3003 How is it Generall? Haue you not hurt your head?
5 3004   Othe. Dost thou mocke me?
5 3005   Iago. I mocke you not, by Heauen:
5 3006 Would you would beare your Fortune like a Man
5 3007 
5 3008    Othe. A Horned man's a Monster, and a Beast
5 3009 
5 3010    Iago. Ther's many a Beast then in a populous Citty,
5 3011 And many a ciuill Monster
5 3012 
5 3013    Othe. Did he confesse it?
5 3014   Iago. Good Sir, be a man:
5 3015 Thinke euery bearded fellow that's but yoak'd
5 3016 May draw with you. There's Millions now aliue,
5 3017 That nightly lye in those vnproper beds,
5 3018 Which they dare sweare peculiar. Your case is better.
5 3019 Oh, 'tis the spight of hell, the Fiends Arch-mock,
5 3020 To lip a wanton in a secure Cowch;
5 3021 And to suppose her chast. No, let me know,
5 3022 And knowing what I am, I know what she shallbe
5 3023 
5 3024    Oth. Oh, thou art wise: 'tis certaine
5 3025 
5 3026    Iago. Stand you a while apart,
5 3027 Confine your selfe but in a patient List,
5 3028 Whil'st you were heere, o're-whelmed with your griefe
5 3029 (A passion most resulting such a man)
5 3030 Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
5 3031 And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie,
5 3032 Bad him anon returne: and heere speake with me,
5 3033 The which he promis'd. Do but encaue your selfe,
5 3034 And marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes
5 3035 That dwell in euery Region of his face.
5 3036 For I will make him tell the Tale anew;
5 3037 Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
5 3038 He hath, and is againe to cope your wife.
5 3039 I say, but marke his gesture: marry Patience,
5 3040 Or I shall say y'are all in all in Spleene,
5 3041 And nothing of a man
5 3042 
5 3043    Othe. Do'st thou heare, Iago,
5 3044 I will be found most cunning in my Patience:
5 3045 But (do'st thou heare) most bloody
5 3046 
5 3047    Iago. That's not amisse,
5 3048 But yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw?
5 3049 Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
5 3050 A Huswife that by selling her desires
5 3051 Buyes her selfe Bread, and Cloath. It is a Creature
5 3052 That dotes on Cassio, (as 'tis the Strumpets plague
5 3053 To be-guile many, and be be-guil'd by one)
5 3054 He, when he heares of her, cannot restraine
5 3055 From the excesse of Laughter. Heere he comes.
5 3056 Enter Cassio.
5 3057 
5 3058 As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad:
5 3059 And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue
5 3060 Poore Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behauiours
5 3061 Quite in the wrong. How do you Lieutenant?
5 3062   Cas. The worser, that you giue me the addition,
5 3063 Whose want euen killes me
5 3064 
5 3065    Iago. Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't:
5 3066 Now, if this Suit lay in Bianca's dowre,
5 3067 How quickely should you speed?
5 3068   Cas. Alas poore Caitiffe
5 3069 
5 3070    Oth. Looke how he laughes already
5 3071 
5 3072    Iago. I neuer knew woman loue man so
5 3073 
5 3074    Cas. Alas poore Rogue, I thinke indeed she loues me
5 3075 
5 3076    Oth. Now he denies it faintly: and laughes it out
5 3077 
5 3078    Iago. Do you heare Cassio?
5 3079   Oth. Now he importunes him
5 3080 To tell it o're: go too, well said, well said
5 3081 
5 3082    Iago. She giues it out, that you shall marry her.
5 3083 Do you intend it?
5 3084   Cas. Ha, ha, ha
5 3085 
5 3086    Oth. Do ye triumph, Romaine? do you triumph?
5 3087   Cas. I marry. What? A customer; prythee beare
5 3088 Some Charitie to my wit, do not thinke it
5 3089 So vnwholesome. Ha, ha, ha
5 3090 
5 3091    Oth. So, so, so, so: they laugh, that winnes
5 3092 
5 3093    Iago. Why the cry goes, that you marry her
5 3094 
5 3095    Cas. Prythee say true
5 3096 
5 3097    Iago. I am a very Villaine else
5 3098 
5 3099    Oth. Haue you scoar'd me? Well
5 3100 
5 3101    Cas. This is the Monkeys owne giuing out:
5 3102 She is perswaded I will marry her
5 3103 Out of her owne loue & flattery, not out of my promise
5 3104 
5 3105    Oth. Iago becomes me: now he begins the story
5 3106 
5 3107    Cassio. She was heere euen now: she haunts me in euery
5 3108 place. I was the other day talking on the Seabanke
5 3109 with certaine Venetians, and thither comes the
5 3110 Bauble, and falls me thus about my neck
5 3111 
5 3112    Oth. Crying oh deere Cassio, as it were: his iesture imports
5 3113 it
5 3114 
5 3115    Cassio. So hangs, and lolls, and weepes vpon me:
5 3116 So shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha
5 3117 
5 3118    Oth. Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber:
5 3119 oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dogge, I
5 3120 shall throw it to
5 3121 
5 3122    Cassio. Well, I must leaue her companie
5 3123 
5 3124    Iago. Before me: looke where she comes.
5 3125 Enter Bianca.
5 3126 
5 3127   Cas. 'Tis such another Fitchew: marry a perfum'd one?
5 3128 What do you meane by this haunting of me?
5 3129   Bian. Let the diuell, and his dam haunt you: what
5 3130 did you meane by that same Handkerchiefe, you gaue
5 3131 me euen now? I was a fine Foole to take it: I must take
5 3132 out the worke? A likely piece of worke, that you should
5 3133 finde it in your Chamber, and know not who left it there.
5 3134 This is some Minxes token, & I must take out the worke?
5 3135 There, giue it your Hobbey-horse, wheresoeuer you had
5 3136 it, Ile take out no worke on't
5 3137 
5 3138    Cassio. How now, my sweete Bianca?
5 3139 How now? How now?
5 3140   Othe. By Heauen, that should be my Handkerchiefe
5 3141 
5 3142    Bian. If you'le come to supper to night you may, if
5 3143 you will not come when you are next prepar'd for.
5 3144 
5 3145 Exit
5 3146 
5 3147   Iago. After her: after her
5 3148 
5 3149    Cas. I must, shee'l rayle in the streets else
5 3150 
5 3151    Iago. Will you sup there?
5 3152   Cassio. Yes, I intend so
5 3153 
5 3154    Iago. Well, I may chance to see you: for I would very
5 3155 faine speake with you
5 3156 
5 3157    Cas. Prythee come: will you?
5 3158   Iago. Go too; say no more
5 3159 
5 3160    Oth. How shall I murther him, Iago
5 3161 
5 3162    Iago. Did you perceiue how he laugh'd at his vice?
5 3163   Oth. Oh, Iago
5 3164 
5 3165    Iago. And did you see the Handkerchiefe?
5 3166   Oth. Was that mine?
5 3167   Iago. Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes
5 3168 the foolish woman your wife: she gaue it him and, he
5 3169 hath giu'n it his whore
5 3170 
5 3171    Oth. I would haue him nine yeeres a killing:
5 3172 A fine woman, a faire woman, a sweete woman?
5 3173   Iago. Nay, you must forget that
5 3174 
5 3175    Othello. I, let her rot and perish, and be damn'd to
5 3176 night, for she shall not liue. No, my heart is turn'd to
5 3177 stone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand. Oh, the world
5 3178 hath not a sweeter Creature: she might lye by an Emperours
5 3179 side, and command him Taskes
5 3180 
5 3181    Iago. Nay, that's not your way
5 3182 
5 3183    Othe. Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate
5 3184 with her Needle: an admirable Musitian. Oh she will
5 3185 sing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare: of so high and plenteous
5 3186 wit, and inuention?
5 3187   Iago. She's the worse for all this
5 3188 
5 3189    Othe. Oh, a thousand, a thousand times:
5 3190 And then of so gentle a condition?
5 3191   Iago. I too gentle
5 3192 
5 3193    Othe. Nay that's certaine:
5 3194 But yet the pitty of it, Iago: oh Iago, the pitty of it
5 3195 Iago
5 3196 
5 3197    Iago. If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her
5 3198 pattent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes neere
5 3199 no body
5 3200 
5 3201    Oth. I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me?
5 3202   Iago. Oh, 'tis foule in her
5 3203 
5 3204    Oth. With mine Officer?
5 3205   Iago. That's fouler
5 3206 
5 3207    Othe. Get me some poyson, Iago, this night. Ile not
5 3208 expostulate with her: least her body and beautie vnprouide
5 3209 my mind againe: this night Iago
5 3210 
5 3211    Iago. Do it not with poyson, strangle her in her bed,
5 3212 Euen the bed she hath contaminated
5 3213 
5 3214    Oth. Good, good:
5 3215 The Iustice of it pleases: very good
5 3216 
5 3217    Iago. And for Cassio, let me be his vndertaker:
5 3218 You shall heare more by midnight.
5 3219 Enter Lodouico, Desdemona, and Attendants.
5 3220 
5 3221   Othe. Excellent good: What Trumpet is that same?
5 3222   Iago. I warrant something from Venice,
5 3223 'Tis Lodouico, this, comes from the Duke.
5 3224 See, your wife's with him
5 3225 
5 3226    Lodo. Saue you worthy Generall
5 3227 
5 3228    Othe. With all my heart Sir
5 3229 
5 3230    Lod. The Duke, and the Senators of Venice greet you
5 3231 
5 3232    Othe. I kisse the Instrument of their pleasures
5 3233 
5 3234    Des. And what's the newes, good cozen Lodouico
5 3235   Iago. I am very glad to see you Signior:
5 3236 Welcome to Cyprus
5 3237 
5 3238    Lod. I thanke you: how do's Lieutenant Cassio?
5 3239   Iago. Liues Sir,
5 3240   Des. Cozen, there's falne betweene him, & my Lord,
5 3241 An vnkind breach: but you shall make all well
5 3242 
5 3243    Othe. Are you sure of that?
5 3244   Des. My Lord?
5 3245   Othe. This faile you not to do, as you will-
5 3246   Lod. He did not call: he's busie in the paper,
5 3247 Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and Cassio?
5 3248   Des. A most vnhappy one: I would do much
5 3249 T' attone, them, for the loue I beare to Cassio
5 3250 
5 3251    Oth. Fire, and brimestone
5 3252 
5 3253    Des. My Lord
5 3254 
5 3255    Oth. Are you wise?
5 3256   Des. What is he angrie?
5 3257   Lod. May be the Letter mou'd him.
5 3258 For as I thinke, they do command him home,
5 3259 Deputing Cassio in his Gouernment
5 3260 
5 3261    Des. Trust me, I am glad on't
5 3262 
5 3263    Othe. Indeed?
5 3264   Des. My Lord?
5 3265   Othe. I am glad to see you mad
5 3266 
5 3267    Des. Why, sweete Othello?
5 3268   Othe. Diuell
5 3269 
5 3270    Des. I haue not deseru'd this
5 3271 
5 3272    Lod. My Lord, this would not be beleeu'd in Venice,
5 3273 Though I should sweare I saw't. 'Tis very much,
5 3274 Make her amends: she weepes
5 3275 
5 3276    Othe. Oh diuell, diuell:
5 3277 If that the Earth could teeme with womans teares,
5 3278 Each drop she falls, would proue a Crocodile:
5 3279 Out of my sight
5 3280 
5 3281    Des. I will not stay to offend you
5 3282 
5 3283    Lod. Truely obedient Lady:
5 3284 I do beseech your Lordship call her backe
5 3285 
5 3286    Othe. Mistris
5 3287 
5 3288    Des. My Lord
5 3289 
5 3290    Othe. What would you with her, Sir?
5 3291   Lod. Who I, my Lord?
5 3292   Othe. I, you did wish, that I would make her turne:
5 3293 Sir, she can turne, and turne: and yet go on
5 3294 And turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe.
5 3295 And she's obedient: as you say obedient.
5 3296 Very obedient: proceed you in your teares.
5 3297 Concerning this Sir, (oh well-painted passion)
5 3298 I am commanded home: get you away:
5 3299 Ile send for you anon. Sir I obey the Mandate,
5 3300 And will returne to Venice. Hence, auaunt:
5 3301 Cassio shall haue my Place. And Sir, to night
5 3302 I do entreat, that we may sup together.
5 3303 You are welcome Sir to Cyprus.
5 3304 Goates, and Monkeys.
5 3305 Enter.
5 3306 
5 3307   Lod. Is this the Noble Moore, whom our full Senate
5 3308 Call all in all sufficient? Is this the Nature
5 3309 Whom Passion could not shake? Whose solid vertue
5 3310 The shot of Accident, nor dart of Chance
5 3311 Could neither graze, nor pierce?
5 3312   Iago. He is much chang'd
5 3313 
5 3314    Lod. Are his wits safe? Is he not light of Braine?
5 3315   Iago. He's that he is: I may not breath my censure.
5 3316 What he might be: if what he might, he is not,
5 3317 I would to heauen he were
5 3318 
5 3319    Lod. What? Strike his wife?
5 3320   Iago. 'Faith that was not so well: yet would I knew
5 3321 That stroke would proue the worst
5 3322 
5 3323    Lod. Is it his vse?
5 3324 Or did the Letters, worke vpon his blood,
5 3325 And new create his fault?
5 3326   Iago. Alas, alas:
5 3327 It is not honestie in me to speake
5 3328 What I haue seene, and knowne. You shall obserue him,
5 3329 And his owne courses will denote him so,
5 3330 That I may saue my speech: do but go after
5 3331 And marke how he continues
5 3332 
5 3333    Lod. I am sorry that I am deceiu'd in him.
5 3334 
5 3335 Exeunt.
5 3336 
5 3337 
5 3338 Scena Secunda.
5 3339 
5 3340 Enter Othello and aemilia.
5 3341 
5 3342   Othe. You haue seene nothing then?
5 3343 Aemil. Nor euer heard: nor euer did suspect
5 3344 
5 3345    Othe. Yes, you haue seene Cassio, and she together
5 3346 
5 3347    Aemi. But then I saw no harme: and then I heard,
5 3348 Each syllable that breath made vp betweene them
5 3349 
5 3350    Othe. What? Did they neuer whisper?
5 3351 Aemil. Neuer my Lord
5 3352 
5 3353    Othe. Nor send you out o'th' way?
5 3354 Aemil. Neuer
5 3355 
5 3356    Othe. To fetch her Fan, her Gloues, her Mask, nor nothing?
5 3357 Aemil. Neuer my Lord
5 3358 
5 3359    Othe. That's strange.
5 3360 Aemil. I durst (my Lord) to wager, she is honest:
5 3361 Lay downe my Soule at stake: If you thinke other,
5 3362 Remoue your thought. It doth abuse your bosome:
5 3363 If any wretch haue put this in your head,
5 3364 Let Heauen requit it with the Serpents curse,
5 3365 For if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
5 3366 There's no man happy. The purest of their Wiues
5 3367 Is foule as Slander
5 3368 
5 3369    Othe. Bid her come hither: go.
5 3370 
5 3371 Exit aemilia.
5 3372 
5 3373 She saies enough: yet she's a simple Baud
5 3374 That cannot say as much. This is a subtile Whore:
5 3375 A Closset Locke and Key of Villanous Secrets,
5 3376 And yet she'le kneele, and pray: I haue seene her do't.
5 3377 Enter Desdemona, and aemilia.
5 3378 
5 3379   Des. My Lord, what is your will?
5 3380   Othe. Pray you Chucke come hither
5 3381 
5 3382    Des. What is your pleasure?
5 3383   Oth. Let me see your eyes: looke in my face
5 3384 
5 3385    Des. What horrible Fancie's this?
5 3386   Othe. Some of your Function Mistris:
5 3387 Leaue Procreants alone, and shut the doore:
5 3388 Cough, or cry hem; if any body come:
5 3389 Your Mystery, your Mystery: May dispatch.
5 3390 
5 3391 Exit aemi.
5 3392 
5 3393   Des. Vpon my knee, what doth your speech import?
5 3394 I vnderstand a Fury in your words
5 3395 
5 3396    Othe. Why? What art thou?
5 3397   Des. Your wife my Lord: your true and loyall wife
5 3398 
5 3399    Othello. Come sweare it: damne thy selfe, least
5 3400 being like one of Heauen, the diuells themselues should
5 3401 feare to ceaze thee. Therefore be double damn'd: sweare
5 3402 thou art honest
5 3403 
5 3404    Des. Heauen doth truely know it
5 3405 
5 3406    Othe. Heauen truely knowes, that thou art false as hell
5 3407 
5 3408    Des. To whom my Lord?
5 3409 With whom? How am I false?
5 3410   Othe. Ah Desdemon, away, away, away
5 3411 
5 3412    Des. Alas the heauy day: why do you weepe?
5 3413 Am I the motiue of these teares my Lord?
5 3414 If happely you my Father do suspect,
5 3415 An Instrument of this your calling backe,
5 3416 Lay not your blame on me: if you haue lost him,
5 3417 I haue lost him too
5 3418 
5 3419    Othe. Had it pleas'd Heauen,
5 3420 To try me with Affliction, had they rain'd
5 3421 All kind of Sores, and Shames on my bare-head:
5 3422 Steep'd me in pouertie to the very lippes.
5 3423 Giuen to Captiuitie, me, and my vtmost hopes,
5 3424 I should haue found in some place of my Soule
5 3425 A drop of patience. But alas, to make me
5 3426 The fixed Figure for the time of Scorne,
5 3427 To point his slow, and mouing finger at.
5 3428 Yet could I beare that too, well, very well:
5 3429 But there where I haue garnerd vp my heart,
5 3430 Where either I must liue, or beare no life,
5 3431 The Fountaine from the which my currant runnes,
5 3432 Or else dries vp: to be discarded thence,
5 3433 Or keepe it as a Cesterne, for foule Toades
5 3434 To knot and gender in. Turne thy complexion there:
5 3435 Patience, thou young and Rose-lip'd Cherubin,
5 3436 I heere looke grim as hell
5 3437 
5 3438    Des. I hope my Noble Lord esteemes me honest
5 3439 
5 3440    Othe. Oh I, as Sommer Flyes are in the Shambles,
5 3441 That quicken euen with blowing. Oh thou weed:
5 3442 Who art so louely faire, and smell'st so sweete,
5 3443 That the Sense akes at thee,
5 3444 Would thou had'st neuer bin borne
5 3445 
5 3446    Des. Alas, what ignorant sin haue I committed?
5 3447   Othe. Was this faire Paper? This most goodly Booke
5 3448 Made to write Whore vpon? What commited,
5 3449 Committed? Oh, thou publicke Commoner,
5 3450 I should make very Forges of my cheekes,
5 3451 That would to Cynders burne vp Modestie,
5 3452 Did I but speake thy deedes. What commited?
5 3453 Heauen stoppes the Nose at it, and the Moone winks:
5 3454 The baudy winde that kisses all it meetes,
5 3455 Is hush'd within the hollow Myne of Earth
5 3456 And will not hear't. What commited?
5 3457   Des. By Heauen you do me wrong
5 3458 
5 3459    Othe. Are not you a Strumpet?
5 3460   Des. No, as I am a Christian.
5 3461 If to preserue this vessell for my Lord,
5 3462 From any other foule vnlawfull touch
5 3463 Be not to be a Strumpet, I am none
5 3464 
5 3465    Othe. What, not a Whore?
5 3466   Des. No, as I shall be sau'd
5 3467 
5 3468    Othe. Is't possible?
5 3469   Des. Oh Heauen forgiue vs
5 3470 
5 3471    Othe. I cry you mercy then.
5 3472 I tooke you for that cunning Whore of Venice,
5 3473 That married with Othello. You Mistris,
5 3474 Enter aemilia.
5 3475 
5 3476 That haue the office opposite to Saint Peter,
5 3477 And keepes the gate of hell. You, you: I you.
5 3478 We haue done our course: there's money for your paines:
5 3479 I pray you turne the key, and keepe our counsaile.
5 3480 Enter.
5 3481 
5 3482 Aemil. Alas, what do's this Gentleman conceiue?
5 3483 How do you Madam? how do you my good Lady?
5 3484   Des. Faith, halfe a sleepe
5 3485 
5 3486    Aemi. Good Madam,
5 3487 What's the matter with my Lord?
5 3488   Des. With who?
5 3489 Aemil. Why, with my Lord, Madam?
5 3490   Des. Who is thy Lord?
5 3491 Aemil. He that is yours, sweet Lady
5 3492 
5 3493    Des. I haue none: do not talke to me, aemilia,
5 3494 I cannot weepe: nor answeres haue I none,
5 3495 But what should go by water. Prythee to night,
5 3496 Lay on my bed my wedding sheetes, remember,
5 3497 And call thy husband hither.
5 3498 Aemil. Heere's a change indeed.
5 3499 Enter.
5 3500 
5 3501   Des. 'Tis meete I should be vs'd so: very meete.
5 3502 How haue I bin behau'd, that he might sticke
5 3503 The small'st opinion on my least misvse?
5 3504 Enter Iago, and aemilia.
5 3505 
5 3506   Iago. What is your pleasure Madam?
5 3507 How is't with you?
5 3508   Des. I cannot tell: those that do teach yong Babes
5 3509 Do it with gentle meanes, and easie taskes.
5 3510 He might haue chid me so; for in good faith
5 3511 I am a Child to chiding
5 3512 
5 3513    Iago. What is the matter Lady?
5 3514 Aemil. Alas (Iago) my Lord hath so bewhor'd her,
5 3515 Throwne such dispight, and heauy termes vpon her
5 3516 That true hearts cannot beare it
5 3517 
5 3518    Des. Am I that name, Iago?
5 3519   Iago. What name, (faire Lady?)
5 3520   Des. Such as she said my Lord did say I was.
5 3521 Aemil. He call'd her whore: a Begger in his drinke:
5 3522 Could not haue laid such termes vpon his Callet
5 3523 
5 3524    Iago. Why did he so?
5 3525   Des. I do not know: I am sure I am none such
5 3526 
5 3527    Iago. Do not weepe, do not weepe: alas the day.
5 3528 Aemil. Hath she forsooke so many Noble Matches?
5 3529 Her Father? And her Country? And her Friends?
5 3530 To be call'd Whore? Would it not make one weepe?
5 3531   Des. It is my wretched Fortune
5 3532 
5 3533    Iago. Beshrew him for't:
5 3534 How comes this Tricke vpon him?
5 3535   Des. Nay, Heauen doth know
5 3536 
5 3537    Aemi. I will be hang'd, if some eternall Villaine,
5 3538 Some busie and insinuating Rogue,
5 3539 Some cogging, cozening Slaue, to get some Office,
5 3540 Haue not deuis'd this Slander: I will be hang'd else
5 3541 
5 3542    Iago. Fie, there is no such man: it is impossible
5 3543 
5 3544    Des. If any such there be, Heauen pardon him.
5 3545 Aemil. A halter pardon him:
5 3546 And hell gnaw his bones.
5 3547 Why should he call her Whore?
5 3548 Who keepes her companie?
5 3549 What Place? What Time?
5 3550 What Forme? What liklyhood?
5 3551 The Moore's abus'd by some most villanous Knaue,
5 3552 Some base notorious Knaue, some scuruy Fellow.
5 3553 Oh Heauens, that such companions thou'd'st vnfold,
5 3554 And put in euery honest hand a whip
5 3555 To lash the Rascalls naked through the world,
5 3556 Euen from the East to th' West
5 3557 
5 3558    Iago. Speake within doore.
5 3559 Aemil. Oh fie vpon them: some such Squire he was
5 3560 That turn'd your wit, the seamy-side without,
5 3561 And made you to suspect me with the Moore
5 3562 
5 3563    Iago. You are a Foole: go too
5 3564 
5 3565    Des. Alas Iago,
5 3566 What shall I do to win my Lord againe?
5 3567 Good Friend, go to him: for by this light of Heauen,
5 3568 I know not how I lost him. Heere I kneele:
5 3569 If ere my will did trespasse 'gainst his Loue,
5 3570 Either in discourse of thought, or actuall deed,
5 3571 Or that mine Eyes, mine Eares, or any Sence
5 3572 Delighted them: or any other Forme.
5 3573 Or that I do not yet, and euer did,
5 3574 And euer will, (though he do shake me off
5 3575 To beggerly diuorcement) Loue him deerely,
5 3576 Comfort forsweare me. Vnkindnesse may do much,
5 3577 And his vnkindnesse may defeat my life,
5 3578 But neuer taynt my Loue. I cannot say Whore,
5 3579 It do's abhorre me now I speake the word,
5 3580 To do the Act, that might the addition earne,
5 3581 Not the worlds Masse of vanitie could make me
5 3582 
5 3583    Iago. I pray you be content: 'tis but his humour:
5 3584 The businesse of the State do's him offence
5 3585 
5 3586    Des. If 'twere no other
5 3587 
5 3588    Iago. It is but so, I warrant,
5 3589 Hearke how these Instruments summon to supper:
5 3590 The Messengers of Venice staies the meate,
5 3591 Go in, and weepe not: all things shall be well.
5 3592 
5 3593 Exeunt. Desdemona and aemilia.
5 3594 
5 3595 Enter Rodorigo.
5 3596 
5 3597 How now Rodorigo?
5 3598   Rod. I do not finde
5 3599 That thou deal'st iustly with me
5 3600 
5 3601    Iago. What in the contrarie?
5 3602   Rodori. Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise
5 3603 Iago, and rather, as it seemes to me now, keep'st from
5 3604 me all conueniencie, then suppliest me with the least aduantage
5 3605 of hope: I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor
5 3606 am I yet perswaded to put vp in peace, what already I
5 3607 haue foolishly suffred
5 3608 
5 3609    Iago. Will you heare me Rodorigo?
5 3610   Rodori. I haue heard too much: and your words and
5 3611 Performances are no kin together
5 3612 
5 3613    Iago. You charge me most vniustly
5 3614 
5 3615    Rodo. With naught but truth: I haue wasted my
5 3616 selfe out of my meanes. The Iewels you haue had from
5 3617 me to deliuer Desdemona, would halfe haue corrupted a
5 3618 Votarist. You haue told me she hath receiu'd them,
5 3619 and return'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine
5 3620 respect, and acquaintance, but I finde none
5 3621 
5 3622    Iago. Well, go too: very well
5 3623 
5 3624    Rod. Very well, go too: I cannot go too, (man) nor
5 3625 'tis not very well. Nay I think it is scuruy: and begin to
5 3626 finde my selfe fopt in it
5 3627 
5 3628    Iago. Very well
5 3629 
5 3630    Rodor. I tell you, 'tis not very well: I will make my
5 3631 selfe knowne to Desdemona. If she will returne me my
5 3632 Iewels, I will giue ouer my Suit, and repent my vnlawfull
5 3633 solicitation. If not, assure your selfe, I will seeke
5 3634 satisfaction of you
5 3635 
5 3636    Iago. You haue said now
5 3637 
5 3638    Rodo. I: and said nothing but what I protest intendment
5 3639 of doing
5 3640 
5 3641    Iago. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and
5 3642 euen from this instant do build on thee a better opinion
5 3643 then euer before: giue me thy hand Rodorigo.
5 3644 Thou hast taken against me a most iust exception:
5 3645 but yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy
5 3646 Affaire
5 3647 
5 3648    Rod. It hath not appeer'd
5 3649 
5 3650    Iago. I grant indeed it hath not appeer'd: and
5 3651 your suspition is not without wit and iudgement.
5 3652 But Rodorigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which
5 3653 I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I
5 3654 meane purpose, Courage, and Valour) this night
5 3655 shew it. If thou the next night following enioy not
5 3656 Desdemona, take me from this world with Treacherie,
5 3657 and deuise Engines for my life
5 3658 
5 3659    Rod. Well: what is it? Is it within, reason and compasse?
5 3660   Iago. Sir, there is especiall Commission come from
5 3661 Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place
5 3662 
5 3663    Rod. Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona
5 3664 returne againe to Venice
5 3665 
5 3666    Iago. Oh no: he goes into Mauritania and taketh
5 3667 away with him the faire Desdemona, vnlesse his abode
5 3668 be lingred heere by some accident. Wherein
5 3669 none can be so determinate, as the remouing of
5 3670 Cassio
5 3671 
5 3672    Rod. How do you meane remouing him?
5 3673   Iago. Why, by making him vncapable of Othello's
5 3674 place: knocking out his braines
5 3675 
5 3676    Rod. And that you would haue me to do
5 3677 
5 3678    Iago. I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a
5 3679 right. He sups to night with a Harlotry: and thither
5 3680 will I go to him. He knowes not yet of his Honourable
5 3681 Fortune, if you will watch his going thence (which
5 3682 I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one)
5 3683 you may take him at your pleasure. I will be neere
5 3684 to second your Attempt, and he shall fall betweene
5 3685 vs. Come, stand not amaz'd at it, but go along with
5 3686 me: I will shew you such a necessitie in his death, that
5 3687 you shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him. It
5 3688 is now high supper time: and the night growes to wast.
5 3689 About it
5 3690 
5 3691    Rod. I will heare further reason for this
5 3692 
5 3693    Iago. And you shalbe satisfi'd.
5 3694 
5 3695 Exeunt.
5 3696 
5 3697 
5 3698 Scena Tertia.
5 3699 
5 3700 Enter Othello, Lodouico, Desdemona, aemilia, and Atendants.
5 3701 
5 3702   Lod. I do beseech you Sir, trouble your selfe no further
5 3703 
5 3704    Oth. Oh pardon me: 'twill do me good to walke
5 3705 
5 3706    Lodoui. Madam, good night: I humbly thanke your
5 3707 Ladyship
5 3708 
5 3709    Des. Your Honour is most welcome
5 3710 
5 3711    Oth. Will you walke Sir? Oh Desdemona
5 3712 
5 3713    Des. My Lord
5 3714 
5 3715    Othello. Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be return'd
5 3716 forthwith: dismisse your Attendant there: look't
5 3717 be done.
5 3718 Enter.
5 3719 
5 3720   Des. I will my Lord
5 3721 
5 3722    Aem. How goes it now? He lookes gentler then he did
5 3723 
5 3724    Des. He saies he will returne incontinent,
5 3725 And hath commanded me to go to bed,
5 3726 And bid me to dismisse you
5 3727 
5 3728    Aemi. Dismisse me?
5 3729   Des. It was his bidding: therefore good aemilia,
5 3730 Giue me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
5 3731 We must not now displease him.
5 3732 Aemil. I, would you had neuer seene him
5 3733 
5 3734    Des. So would not I: my loue doth so approue him,
5 3735 That euen his stubbornesse, his checks, his frownes,
5 3736 (Prythee vn-pin me) haue grace and fauour
5 3737 
5 3738    Aemi. I haue laid those Sheetes you bad me on the bed
5 3739 
5 3740    Des. All's one: good Father, how foolish are our minds?
5 3741 If I do die before, prythee shrow'd me
5 3742 In one of these same Sheetes.
5 3743 Aemil. Come, come: you talke
5 3744 
5 3745    Des. My Mother had a Maid call'd Barbarie,
5 3746 She was in loue: and he she lou'd prou'd mad,
5 3747 And did forsake her. She had a Song of Willough,
5 3748 An old thing 'twas: but it express'd her Fortune,
5 3749 And she dy'd singing it. That Song to night,
5 3750 Will not go from my mind: I haue much to do,
5 3751 But to go hang my head all at one side
5 3752 And sing it like poore Barbarie: prythee dispatch
5 3753 
5 3754    Aemi. Shall I go fetch your Night-gowne?
5 3755   Des. No, vn-pin me here,
5 3756 This Lodouico is a proper man.
5 3757 Aemil. A very handsome man
5 3758 
5 3759    Des. He speakes well.
5 3760 Aemil. I know a Lady in Venice would haue walk'd
5 3761 barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip
5 3762 
5 3763    Des. The poore Soule sat singing, by a Sicamour tree.
5 3764 Sing all a greene Willough:
5 3765 Her hand on her bosome her head on her knee,
5 3766 Sing Willough, Willough, Willough.
5 3767 The fresh Streames ran by her, and murmur'd her moanes
5 3768 Sing Willough, &c.
5 3769 Her salt teares fell from her, and softned the stones,
5 3770 Sing Willough, &c. (Lay by these)
5 3771 Willough, Willough. (Prythee high thee: he'le come anon)
5 3772 Sing all a greene Willough must be my Garland.
5 3773 Let no body blame him, his scorne I approue.
5 3774 (Nay that's not next. Harke, who is't that knocks?
5 3775 Aemil. It's the wind
5 3776 
5 3777    Des. I call'd my Loue false Loue: but what said he then?
5 3778 Sing Willough, &c.
5 3779 If I court mo women, you'le couch with mo men.
5 3780 So get thee gone, good night: mine eyes do itch:
5 3781 Doth that boade weeping?
5 3782 Aemil. 'Tis neyther heere, nor there
5 3783 
5 3784    Des. I haue heard it said so. O these Men, these men!
5 3785 Do'st thou in conscience thinke (tell me aemilia)
5 3786 That there be women do abuse their husbands
5 3787 In such grosse kinde?
5 3788 Aemil. There be some such, no question
5 3789 
5 3790    Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for all the world?
5 3791 Aemil. Why, would not you?
5 3792   Des. No, by this Heauenly light.
5 3793 Aemil. Nor I neither, by this Heauenly light:
5 3794 I might doo't as well i'th' darke
5 3795 
5 3796    Des. Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world?
5 3797 Aemil. The world's a huge thing:
5 3798 It is a great price, for a small vice
5 3799 
5 3800    Des. Introth, I thinke thou would'st not.
5 3801 Aemil. Introth I thinke I should, and vndoo't when
5 3802 I had done. Marry, I would not doe such a thing for a
5 3803 ioynt Ring, nor for measures of Lawne, nor for Gownes,
5 3804 Petticoats, nor Caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for
5 3805 all the whole world: why, who would not make her husband
5 3806 a Cuckold, to make him a Monarch? I should venture
5 3807 Purgatory for't
5 3808 
5 3809    Des. Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
5 3810 For the whole world.
5 3811 Aemil. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i'th' world;
5 3812 and hauing the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in
5 3813 your owne world, and you might quickly make it right
5 3814 
5 3815    Des. I do not thinke there is any such woman.
5 3816 Aemil. Yes, a dozen: and as many to'th' vantage, as
5 3817 would store the world they plaid for.
5 3818 But I do thinke it is their Husbands faults
5 3819 If Wiues do fall: (Say, that they slacke their duties,
5 3820 And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps;
5 3821 Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies,
5 3822 Throwing restraint vpon vs: Or say they strike vs,
5 3823 Or scant our former hauing in despight)
5 3824 Why we haue galles: and though we haue some Grace,
5 3825 Yet haue we some Reuenge. Let Husbands know,
5 3826 Their wiues haue sense like them: They see, and smell,
5 3827 And haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre,
5 3828 As Husbands haue. What is it that they do,
5 3829 When they change vs for others? Is it Sport?
5 3830 I thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it?
5 3831 I thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres?
5 3832 It is so too. And haue not we Affections?
5 3833 Desires for Sport? and Frailty, as men haue?
5 3834 Then let them vse vs well: else let them know,
5 3835 The illes we do, their illes instruct vs so
5 3836 
5 3837    Des. Good night, good night:
5 3838 Heauen me such vses send,
5 3839 Not to picke bad, from bad; but by bad, mend.
5 3840 
5 3841 Exeunt.
5 3842 
5 3843 Actus Quintus. Scena Prima.
5 3844 
5 3845 Enter Iago, and Rodorigo.
5 3846 
5 3847   Iago. Heere, stand behinde this Barke,
5 3848 Straight will he come:
5 3849 Weare thy good Rapier bare, and put it home:
5 3850 Quicke, quicke, feare nothing; Ile be at thy Elbow,
5 3851 It makes vs, or it marres vs, thinke on that,
5 3852 And fixe most firme thy Resolution
5 3853 
5 3854    Rod. Be neere at hand, I may miscarry in't
5 3855 
5 3856    Iago. Heere, at thy hand: Be bold, & take thy stand
5 3857 
5 3858    Rod. I haue no great deuotion to the deed,
5 3859 And yet he hath giuen me satisfying Reasons:
5 3860 'Tis but a man gone. Forth my Sword: he dies
5 3861 
5 3862    Iago. I haue rub'd this yong Quat almost to the sense,
5 3863 And he growes angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
5 3864 Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
5 3865 Euery way makes my gaine. Liue Rodorigo,
5 3866 He calles me to a restitution large
5 3867 Of Gold, and Iewels, that I bob'd from him,
5 3868 As Guifts to Desdemona.
5 3869 It must not be: If Cassio do remaine,
5 3870 He hath a dayly beauty in his life,
5 3871 That makes me vgly: and besides, the Moore
5 3872 May vnfold me to him: there stand I in much perill:
5 3873 No, he must dye. But so, I heard him comming.
5 3874 Enter Cassio.
5 3875 
5 3876   Rod. I know his gate, 'tis he: Villaine thou dyest
5 3877 
5 3878    Cas. That thrust had beene mine enemy indeed,
5 3879 But that my Coate is better then thou know'st:
5 3880 I will make proofe of thine
5 3881 
5 3882    Rod. Oh, I am slaine
5 3883 
5 3884    Cassio. I am maym'd for euer:
5 3885 Helpe hoa: Murther, murther.
5 3886 Enter Othello.
5 3887 
5 3888   Oth. The voyce of Cassio. Iago keepes his word

5 3899 And your vnblest Fate highes: Strumpet I come:
5 3900 For of my heart, those Charmes thine Eyes, are blotted.

5 3920 To come into the cry, without more helpe
5 3921 
5 3922    Rod. Nobody come: then shall I bleed to death.
5 3923 Enter Iago.
5 3924 
5 3925   Lod. Hearke
5 3926 
5 3927    Gra. Here's one comes in his shirt, with Light, and
5 3928 Weapons
5 3929 
5 3930    Iago. Who's there?
5 3931 Who's noyse is this that cries on murther?
5 3932   Lodo. We do not know
5 3933 
5 3934    Iago. Do not you heare a cry?

5 3936 
5 3937    Iago. What's the matter?
5 3938   Gra. This is Othello's Ancient, as I take it
5 3939 
5 3940    Lodo. The same indeede, a very valiant Fellow
5 3941 
5 3942    Iago. What are you heere, that cry so greeuously?

5 3945 
5 3946    Iago. O mee, Lieutenant!

5 3948   Cas. I thinke that one of them is heereabout.
5 3949 And cannot make away
5 3950

5 3952 What are you there? Come in, and giue some helpe

5 3964   Lod. As you shall proue vs, praise vs
5 3965 
5 3966    Iago. Signior Lodouico?

5 3970 
5 3971    Gra. Cassio?
5 3972   Iago. How is't Brother?
5 3973   Cas. My Legge is cut in two
5 3974 
5 3975    Iago. Marry heauen forbid:
5 3976 Light Gentlemen, Ile binde it with my shirt.
5 3977 Enter Bianca.
5 3978 
5 3979   Bian. What is the matter hoa? Who is't that cry'd?
5 3980   Iago. Who is't that cry'd?
5 3981   Bian. Oh my deere Cassio,
5 3982 My sweet Cassio: Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio
5 3983 
5 3984    Iago. O notable Strumpet. Cassio, may you suspect
5 3985 Who they should be, that haue thus mangled you?
5 3986   Cas. No
5 3987 
5 3988    Gra. I am sorry to finde you thus;
5 3989 I haue beene to seeke you
5 3990 
5 3991    Iago. Lend me a Garter. So: - Oh for a Chaire
5 3992 To beare him easily hence
5 3993 
5 3994    Bian. Alas he faints. Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio
5 3995 
5 3996    Iago. Gentlemen all, I do suspect this Trash
5 3997 To be a party in this Iniurie.
5 3998 Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
5 3999 Lend me a Light: know we this face, or no?
5 4000 Alas my Friend, and my deere Countryman
5 4001 Rodorigo? No: Yes sure: Yes, 'tis Rodorigo
5 4002 
5 4003    Gra. What, of Venice?
5 4004   Iago. Euen he Sir: Did you know him?
5 4005   Gra. Know him? I
5 4006 
5 4007    Iago. Signior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon:
5 4008 These bloody accidents must excuse my Manners,
5 4009 That so neglected you
5 4010 
5 4011    Gra. I am glad to see you
5 4012 
5 4013    Iago. How do you Cassio? Oh, a Chaire, a Chaire
5 4014 
5 4015    Gra. Rodorigo?
5 4016   Iago. He, he, 'tis he:
5 4017 Oh that's well said, the Chaire.
5 4018 Some good man beare him carefully from hence,
5 4019 Ile fetch the Generall's Surgeon. For you Mistris,
5 4020 Saue you your labour. He that lies slaine heere (Cassio)
5 4021 Was my deere friend. What malice was between you
5 4022 
5 4023    Cas. None in the world: nor do I know the man?
5 4024   Iago. What? looke you pale? Oh beare him o'th' Ayre.
5 4025 Stay you good Gentlemen. Looke you pale, Mistris?
5 4026 Do you perceiue the gastnesse of her eye?
5 4027 Nay, if you stare, we shall heare more anon.
5 4028 Behold her well: I pray you looke vpon her:
5 4029 Do you see Gentlemen? Nay, guiltinesse will speake
5 4030 Though tongues were out of vse.
5 4031 Aemil. Alas, what is the matter?
5 4032 What is the matter, Husband?
5 4033   Iago. Cassio hath heere bin set on in the darke
5 4034 By Rodorigo, and Fellowes that are scap'd:
5 4035 He's almost slaine, and Rodorigo quite dead.
5 4036 Aemil. Alas good Gentleman: alas good Cassio
5 4037 
5 4038    Iago. This is the fruits of whoring. Prythe aemilia,
5 4039 Go know of Cassio where he supt to night.
5 4040 What, do you shake at that?
5 4041   Bian. He supt at my house, but I therefore shake not
5 4042 
5 4043    Iago. O did he so? I charge you go with me.
5 4044 Aemil. Oh fie vpon thee Strumpet
5 4045 
5 4046    Bian. I am no Strumpet, but of life as honest,
5 4047 As you that thus abuse me.
5 4048 Aemil. As I? Fie vpon thee
5 4049 
5 4050    Iago. Kinde Gentlemen:
5 4051 Let's go see poore Cassio drest.
5 4052 Come Mistris, you must tel's another Tale.
5 4053 aemilia, run you to the Cittadell,
5 4054 And tell my Lord and Lady, what hath happ'd:
5 4055 Will you go on afore? This is the night
5 4056 That either makes me, or foredoes me quight.
5 4057 
5 4058 Exeunt.
5 4059 
5 4060 Scoena Secunda.
5 4061 
5 4062 Enter Othello, and Desdemona in her bed.
5 4063 
5 4064   Oth. It is the Cause, it is the Cause (my Soule)
5 4065 Let me not name it to you, you chaste Starres,
5 4066 It is the Cause. Yet Ile not shed her blood,
5 4067 Nor scarre that whiter skin of hers, then Snow,
5 4068 And smooth as Monumentall Alablaster:
5 4069 Yet she must dye, else shee'l betray more men:
5 4070 Put out the Light, and then put out the Light:
5 4071 If I quench thee, thou flaming Minister,
5 4072 I can againe thy former light restore,
5 4073 Should I repent me. But once put out thy Light,
5 4074 Thou cunning'st Patterne of excelling Nature,
5 4075 I know not where is that Promethaean heate
5 4076 That can thy Light re-Lume.
5 4077 When I haue pluck'd thy Rose,
5 4078 I cannot giue it vitall growth againe,
5 4079 It needs must wither. Ile smell thee on the Tree.
5 4080 Oh Balmy breath, that dost almost perswade
5 4081 Iustice to breake her Sword. One more, one more:
5 4082 Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
5 4083 And loue thee after. One more, and that's the last.
5 4084 So sweet, was ne're so fatall. I must weepe,
5 4085 But they are cruell Teares: This sorrow's heauenly,
5 4086 It strikes, where it doth loue. She wakes
5 4087 
5 4088    Des. Who's there? Othello?
5 4089   Othel. I Desdemona
5 4090 
5 4091    Des. Will you come to bed, my Lord?
5 4092   Oth. Haue you pray'd to night, Desdemon?
5 4093   Des. I my Lord
5 4094 
5 4095    Oth. If you bethinke your selfe of any Crime
5 4096 Vnreconcil'd as yet to Heauen, and Grace,
5 4097 Solicite for it straight
5 4098 
5 4099    Des. Alacke, my Lord,
5 4100 What may you meane by that?
5 4101   Oth. Well, do it, and be breefe, I will walke by:
5 4102 I would not kill thy vnprepared Spirit,
5 4103 No, Heauens fore-fend) I would not kill thy Soule
5 4104 
5 4105    Des. Talke you of killing?
5 4106   Oth. I, I do
5 4107 
5 4108    Des. Then Heauen haue mercy on mee
5 4109 
5 4110    Oth. Amen, with all my heart
5 4111 
5 4112    Des. If you say, I hope you will not kill me
5 4113 
5 4114    Oth. Humh
5 4115 
5 4116    Des. And yet I feare you: for you're fatall then
5 4117 When your eyes rowle so.
5 4118 Why I should feare, I know not,
5 4119 Since guiltinesse I know not: But yet I feele I feare
5 4120 
5 4121    Oth. Thinke on thy sinnes
5 4122 
5 4123    Des. They are Loues I beare to you
5 4124 
5 4125    Oth. I, and for that thou dy'st
5 4126 
5 4127    Des. That death's vnnaturall, that kils for louing.
5 4128 Alas, why gnaw you so your nether-lip?
5 4129 Some bloody passion shakes your very Frame:
5 4130 These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope,
5 4131 They do not point on me
5 4132 
5 4133    Oth. Peace, and be still
5 4134 
5 4135    Des. I will so: What's the matter?
5 4136   Oth. That Handkerchiefe
5 4137 Which I so lou'd, and gaue thee, thou gau'st to Cassio
5 4138 
5 4139    Des. No by my Life, and Soule: send for the man,
5 4140 And aske him
5 4141 
5 4142    Oth. Sweet Soule, take heed, take heed of Periury,
5 4143 Thou art on thy death-bed
5 4144 
5 4145    Des. I, but not yet to dye
5 4146 
5 4147    Oth. Presently.
5 4148 Therefore confesse thee freely of thy sinne:
5 4149 For to deny each Article with Oath,
5 4150 Cannot remoue, nor choake the strong Conception
5 4151 That I do grone withall. Thou art to dye
5 4152 
5 4153    Des. O Heauen haue mercy on me
5 4154 
5 4155    Oth. I say, Amen
5 4156 
5 4157    Des. And haue you mercy too. I neuer did
5 4158 Offend you in my life: neuer lou'd Cassio,
5 4159 But with such generall warrantie of Heauen,
5 4160 As I might loue. I neuer gaue him Token
5 4161 
5 4162    Oth. By Heauen I saw my Handkerchiefe in's hand.
5 4163 O periur'd woman, thou do'st stone my heart,
5 4164 And makes me call, what I intend to do,
5 4165 A Murther, which I thought a Sacrifice.
5 4166 I saw the Handkerchiefe
5 4167 
5 4168    Des. He found it then:
5 4169 I neuer gaue it him: Send, for him hither:
5 4170 Let him confesse a truth
5 4171 
5 4172    Oth. He hath confest
5 4173 
5 4174    Des. What, my Lord?
5 4175   Oth. That he hath vs'd thee
5 4176 
5 4177    Des. How? vnlawfully?
5 4178   Oth. I
5 4179 
5 4180    Des. He will not say so
5 4181 
5 4182    Oth. No: his mouth is stopp'd:
5 4183 Honest Iago hath 'tane order for't
5 4184 
5 4185    Des. Oh, my feare interprets. What is he dead?
5 4186   Oth. Had all his haires bin liues, my great Reuenge
5 4187 Had stomacke for them all
5 4188 
5 4189    Des. Alas, he is betray'd, and I vndone
5 4190 
5 4191    Oth. Out Strumpet: weep'st thou for him to my face?
5 4192   Des. O banish me, my Lord, but kill me not
5 4193 
5 4194    Oth. Downe Strumpet
5 4195 
5 4196    Des. Kill me to morrow, let me liue to night
5 4197 
5 4198    Oth. Nay, if you striue
5 4199 
5 4200    Des. But halfe an houre
5 4201 
5 4202    Oth. Being done, there is no pawse
5 4203 
5 4204    Des. But while I say one prayer
5 4205 
5 4206    Oth. It is too late.
5 4207 
5 4208 Smothers her.
5 4209 
5 4210 aemilia at the doore.
5 4211 
5 4212 Aemil. My Lord, my Lord? What hoa?
5 4213 My Lord, my Lord
5 4214 
5 4215    Oth. What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
5 4216 I that am cruell, am yet mercifull,
5 4217 I would not haue thee linger in thy paine?
5 4218 So, so.
5 4219 Aemil. within. What hoa? my Lord, my Lord?
5 4220   Oth. Who's there?
5 4221 Aemil. Oh good my Lord, I would speake a word
5 4222 with you
5 4223 
5 4224    Oth. Yes: 'Tis aemilia: by and by. Shee's dead.
5 4225 'Tis like she comes to speake of Cassio's death:
5 4226 The noise was high. Hah, no more moouing?
5 4227 Still as the Graue. Shall she come in? Wer't good?
5 4228 I thinke she stirres againe. No, what's best to do?
5 4229 If she come in, shee'l sure speake to my wife:
5 4230 My wife, my wife: what wife? I haue no wife.
5 4231 Oh insupportable! Oh heauy houre!
5 4232 Me thinkes, it should be now a huge Eclipse
5 4233 Of Sunne, and Moone; and that th' affrighted Globe
5 4234 Did yawne at Alteration.
5 4235 Aemil. I do beseech you
5 4236 That I may speake with you. Oh good my Lord
5 4237 
5 4238    Oth. I had forgot thee: oh come in aemilia.
5 4239 Soft, by and by, let me the Curtaines draw.
5 4240 Where art thou? What's the matter with thee now?
5 4241 Enter aemilia.
5 4242 
5 4243 Aemil. Oh my good Lord, yonders foule Murthers
5 4244 done
5 4245 
5 4246    Oth. What? now?
5 4247 Aemil. But now, my Lord
5 4248 
5 4249    Oth. It is the very error of the Moone,
5 4250 She comes more neerer Earth then she was wont,
5 4251 And makes men mad.
5 4252 Aemil. Cassio, my Lord, hath kill'd
5 4253 A young Venetian, call'd Rodorigo
5 4254 
5 4255    Oth. Rodorigo kill'd? and Cassio kill'd?
5 4256 Aemil. No, Cassio is not kill'd
5 4257 
5 4258    Oth. Not Cassio kill'd? Then Murther's out of tune,
5 4259 And sweet Reuenge growes harsh
5 4260 
5 4261    Des. O falsely, falsely murder'd.
5 4262 Aemil. Alas! what cry is that?
5 4263   Oth. That? What?
5 4264 Aemil. Out, and alas, that was my Ladies voice.
5 4265 Helpe, helpe hoa, helpe. Oh Ladie speake againe,
5 4266 Sweet Desdemona, oh sweet Mistris, speake
5 4267 
5 4268    Des. A guiltlesse death, I dye.
5 4269 Aemil. Oh who hath done this deed?
5 4270   Des. No body: I my selfe, farewell:
5 4271 Commend me to my kinde Lord: oh farewell
5 4272 
5 4273    Oth. Why, how should she be murdred?
5 4274 Aemil. Alas: who knowes?
5 4275   Oth. You heare her say her selfe, it was not I.
5 4276 Aemil. She said so: I must needs report the truth
5 4277 
5 4278    Oth. She's like a Liar gone to burning hell,
5 4279 'Twas I that kill'd her.
5 4280 Aemil. Oh the more Angell she, and you the blacker
5 4281 Diuell
5 4282 
5 4283    Oth. She turn'd to folly: and she was a whore.
5 4284 Aemil. Thou do'st bely her, and thou art a diuell
5 4285 
5 4286    Oth. She was false as water.
5 4287 Aemil. Thou art rash as fire, to say
5 4288 That she was false. Oh she was heauenly true
5 4289 
5 4290    Oth. Cassio did top her: Ask thy husband else.
5 4291 O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell:
5 4292 But that I did proceed vpon iust grounds
5 4293 To this extremity. Thy Husband knew it all.
5 4294 Aemil. My Husband?
5 4295   Oth. Thy Husband.
5 4296 Aemil. That she was false to Wedlocke?
5 4297   Oth. I, with Cassio: had she bin true,
5 4298 If Heauen would make me such another world,
5 4299 Of one entyre and perfect Chrysolite,
5 4300 I'ld not haue sold her for it.
5 4301 Aemil. My Husband?
5 4302   Oth. I, 'twas he that told me on her first,
5 4303 An honest man he is, and hates the slime
5 4304 That stickes on filthy deeds.
5 4305 Aemil. My Husband?
5 4306   Oth. What needs this itterance, Woman?
5 4307 I say, thy Husband.
5 4308 Aemil. Oh Mistris,
5 4309 Villany hath made mockes with loue:
5 4310 My Husband say she was false?
5 4311   Oth. He, Woman;
5 4312 I say thy Husband: Do'st vnderstand the word?
5 4313 My Friend, thy Husband; honest, honest Iago.
5 4314 Aemil. If he say so, may his pernicious Soule
5 4315 Rot halfe a graine a day: he lyes to'th' heart,
5 4316 She was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine
5 4317 
5 4318    Oth. Hah?
5 4319 Aemil. Do thy worst:
5 4320 This deede of thine is no more worthy Heauen,
5 4321 Then thou was't worthy her
5 4322 
5 4323    Oth. Peace, you were best.
5 4324 Aemil. Thou hast not halfe that powre to do me harm,
5 4325 As I haue to be hurt. Oh Gull, oh dolt,
5 4326 As ignorant as durt: thou hast done a deed
5 4327 (I care not for thy Sword) Ile make thee known,
5 4328 Though I lost twenty liues. Helpe, helpe, hoa, helpe:
5 4329 The Moore hath kill'd my Mistris. Murther, murther.
5 4330 Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago.
5 4331 
5 4332   Mon. What is the matter? How now Generall?
5 4333 Aemil. Oh, are you come, Iago: you haue done well,
5 4334 That men must lay their Murthers on your necke
5 4335 
5 4336    Gra. What is the matter?
5 4337 Aemil. Disproue this Villaine, if thou bee'st a man:
5 4338 He sayes, thou told'st him that his wife was false:
5 4339 I know thou did'st not: thou'rt not such a Villain.
5 4340 Speake, for my heart is full
5 4341 
5 4342    Iago. I told him what I thought,
5 4343 And told no more
5 4344 Then what he found himselfe was apt, and true.
5 4345 Aemil. But did you euer tell him,
5 4346 She was false?
5 4347   Iago. I did.
5 4348 Aemil. You told a Lye an odious damned Lye:
5 4349 Vpon my Soule, a Lye; a wicked Lye.
5 4350 Shee false with Cassio?
5 4351 Did you say with Cassio?
5 4352   Iago. With Cassio, Mistris?
5 4353 Go too, charme your tongue
5 4354 
5 4355    Emil. I will not charme my Tongue;
5 4356 I am bound to speake,
5 4357 My Mistris heere lyes murthered in her bed
5 4358 
5 4359    All. Oh Heauens, forefend
5 4360 
5 4361    Emil. And your reports haue set the Murder on
5 4362 
5 4363    Othello. Nay stare not Masters,
5 4364 It is true indeede
5 4365 
5 4366    Gra. 'Tis a strange Truth
5 4367 
5 4368    Mont. O monstrous Acte
5 4369 
5 4370    Emil. Villany, villany, villany:
5 4371 I thinke vpon't, I thinke: I smel't: O Villany:
5 4372 I thought so then: Ile kill my selfe for greefe.
5 4373 O villany! villany!
5 4374   Iago. What, are you mad?
5 4375 I charge you get you home
5 4376 
5 4377    Emil. Good Gentlemen, let me haue leaue to speake:
5 4378 'Tis proper I obey him; but not now:
5 4379 Perchance Iago, I will ne're go home
5 4380 
5 4381    Oth. Oh, oh, oh
5 4382 
5 4383    Emil. Nay, lay thee downe, and roare:
5 4384 For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent,
5 4385 That ere did lift vp eye
5 4386 
5 4387    Oth. Oh she was fowle!
5 4388 I scarse did know you Vnkle, there lies your Neece,
5 4389 Whose breath (indeed) these hands haue newly stopp'd:
5 4390 I know this acte shewes horrible and grim
5 4391 
5 4392    Gra. Poore Desdemon:
5 4393 I am glad thy Father's dead,
5 4394 Thy Match was mortall to him: and pure greefe
5 4395 Shore his old thred in twaine. Did he liue now,
5 4396 This sight would make him do a desperate turne:
5 4397 Yea, curse his better Angell from his side,
5 4398 And fall to Reprobance
5 4399 
5 4400    Oth. 'Tis pittifull: but yet Iago knowes
5 4401 That she with Cassio, hath the Act of shame
5 4402 A thousand times committed. Cassio confest it,
5 4403 And she did gratifie his amorous workes
5 4404 With that Recognizance and pledge of Loue
5 4405 Which I first gaue her: I saw it in his hand:
5 4406 It was a Handkerchiefe, an Antique Token
5 4407 My Father gaue my Mother
5 4408 
5 4409    Emil. Oh Heauen! oh heauenly Powres!
5 4410   Iago. Come, hold your peace
5 4411 
5 4412    Emil. 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace?
5 4413 No, I will speake as liberall as the North;
5 4414 Let Heauen, and Men, and Diuels, let them all,
5 4415 All, all, crie shame against me, yet Ile speake
5 4416 
5 4417    Iago. Be wise, and get you home
5 4418 
5 4419    Emil. I will not
5 4420 
5 4421    Gra. Fye, your Sword vpon a Woman
5 4422 
5 4423    Emil. Oh thou dull Moore,
5 4424 That Handkerchiefe thou speak'st of
5 4425 I found by Fortune, and did giue my Husband:
5 4426 For often, with a solemne earnestnesse,
5 4427 (More then indeed belong'd to such a Trifle)
5 4428 He begg'd of me, to steale't
5 4429 
5 4430    Iago. Villanous Whore
5 4431 
5 4432    Emil. She giue it Cassio? No, alas I found it,
5 4433 And I did giu't my Husband
5 4434 
5 4435    Iago. Filth, thou lyest
5 4436 
5 4437    Emil. By Heauen I do not, I do not Gentlemen:
5 4438 Oh murd'rous Coxcombe, what should such a Foole
5 4439 Do with so good a wife?
5 4440   Oth. Are there no stones in Heauen,
5 4441 But what serues for the Thunder?
5 4442 Precious Villaine
5 4443 
5 4444    Gra. The woman falles:
5 4445 Sure he hath kill'd his Wife
5 4446 
5 4447    Emil. I, I: oh lay me by my Mistris side
5 4448 
5 4449    Gra. Hee's gone, but his wife's kill'd
5 4450 
5 4451    Mon. 'Tis a notorious Villain: take you this weapon
5 4452 Which I haue recouer'd from the Moore:
5 4453 Come guard the doore without, let him not passe,
5 4454 But kill him rather. Ile after that same villaine,
5 4455 For 'tis a damned Slaue.
5 4456 Enter.
5 4457 
5 4458   Oth. I am not valiant neither:
5 4459 But euery Punie whipster gets my Sword.
5 4460 But why should Honor out-liue Honesty?
5 4461 Let it go all.
5 4462 Aemil. What did thy Song boad Lady?
5 4463 Hearke, canst thou heare me? I will play the Swan,
5 4464 And dye in Musicke: Willough, Willough, Willough.
5 4465 Moore, she was chaste: She lou'd thee, cruell Moore,
5 4466 So come my Soule to blisse, as I speake true:
5 4467 So speaking as I thinke, alas, I dye
5 4468 
5 4469    Oth. I haue another weapon in this Chamber,
5 4470 It was a Sword of Spaine, the Ice brookes temper:
5 4471 Oh heere it is: Vnkle I must come forth
5 4472 
5 4473    Gra. If thou attempt it, it will cost thee deere;
5 4474 Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer
5 4475 
5 4476    Oth. Looke in vpon me then, and speake with me,
5 4477 Or naked as I am I will assault thee
5 4478 
5 4479    Gra. What is the matter?
5 4480   Othel. Behold, I haue a weapon:
5 4481 A better neuer did it selfe sustaine
5 4482 Vpon a Soldiers Thigh. I haue seene the day,
5 4483 That with this little Arme, and this good Sword,
5 4484 I haue made my way through more impediments
5 4485 Then twenty times your stop. But (oh vaine boast)
5 4486 Who can controll his Fate? 'Tis not so now.
5 4487 Be not affraid, though you do see me weapon'd:
5 4488 Heere is my iournies end, heere is my butt
5 4489 And verie Sea-marke of my vtmost Saile.
5 4490 Do you go backe dismaid? 'Tis a lost feare:
5 4491 Man but a Rush against Othello's brest,
5 4492 And he retires. Where should Othello go?
5 4493 Now: how dost thou looke now? Oh ill-Starr'd wench,
5 4494 Pale as thy Smocke: when we shall meete at compt,
5 4495 This looke of thine will hurle my Soule from Heauen,
5 4496 And Fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my Girle?
5 4497 Euen like thy Chastity. O cursed, cursed Slaue!
5 4498 Whip me ye Diuels,
5 4499 From the possession of this Heauenly sight:
5 4500 Blow me about in windes, roast me in Sulphure,
5 4501 Wash me in steepe-downe gulfes of Liquid fire.
5 4502 Oh Desdemon! dead Desdemon: dead. Oh, oh!
5 4503 Enter Lodouico, Cassio, Montano, and Iago, with Officers.
5 4504 
5 4505   Lod. Where is this rash, and most vnfortunate man?
5 4506   Oth. That's he that was Othello: heere I am
5 4507 
5 4508    Lod. Where is that Viper?
5 4509 Bring the Villaine forth
5 4510 
5 4511    Oth. I look down towards his feet; but that's a Fable,
5 4512 If that thou bee'st a Diuell, I cannot kill thee
5 4513 
5 4514    Lod. Wrench his Sword from him
5 4515 
5 4516    Iago. I bleed Sir, but not kill'd
5 4517 
5 4518    Othel. I am not sorry neither, Il'd haue thee liue:
5 4519 For in my sense, 'tis happinesse to die
5 4520 
5 4521    Lod. Oh thou Othello, that was once so good,
5 4522 Falne in the practise of a cursed Slaue,
5 4523 What shall be saide to thee
5 4524 
5 4525    Oth. Why any thing:
5 4526 An honourable Murderer, if you will:
5 4527 For nought I did in hate, but all in Honour
5 4528 
5 4529    Lod. This wretch hath part confest his Villany:
5 4530 Did you and he consent in Cassio's death
5 4531 
5 4532    Oth. I
5 4533 
5 4534    Cas. Deere Generall, I neuer gaue you cause
5 4535 
5 4536    Oth. I do beleeue it, and I aske your pardon:
5 4537 Will you, I pray, demand that demy-Diuell,
5 4538 Why he hath thus ensnar'd my Soule and Body
5 4539 
5 4540    Iag. Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
5 4541 From this time forth, I neuer will speake word
5 4542 
5 4543    Lod. What? not to pray?
5 4544   Gra. Torments will ope your lips
5 4545 
5 4546    Oth. Well, thou dost best
5 4547 
5 4548    Lod. Sir,
5 4549 You shall vnderstand what hath befalne,
5 4550 (Which, as I thinke, you know not) heere is a Letter
5 4551 Found in the pocket of the slaine Rodorigo,
5 4552 And heere another, the one of them imports
5 4553 The death of Cassio, to be vndertooke
5 4554 By Rodorigo
5 4555 
5 4556    Oth. O Villaine!
5 4557   Cassio. Most Heathenish, and most grosse
5 4558 
5 4559    Lod. Now, heere's another discontented paper
5 4560 Found in his pocket too: and this it seemes
5 4561 Rodorigo meant t'haue sent this damned villaine:
5 4562 But that (belike) Iago in the interim
5 4563 Came in, and satisfi'd him
5 4564 
5 4565    Oth. Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe;
5 4566 How came you (Cassio) by that Handkerchiefe
5 4567 That was my wiues?
5 4568   Cassio. I found it in my Chamber:
5 4569 And he himselfe confest it but euen now,
5 4570 That there he dropt it for a speciall purpose,
5 4571 Which wrought to his desire
5 4572 
5 4573    Othel. O Foole, foole, foole!
5 4574   Cassio. There is besides, in Rodorigo's Letter,
5 4575 How he vpbraides Iago, that he made him
5 4576 Braue me vpon the Watch: whereon it came
5 4577 That I was cast: and euen but now he spake
5 4578 (After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him,
5 4579 Iago set him on
5 4580 
5 4581    Lod. You must forsake this roome, and go with vs:
5 4582 Your Power, and your Command is taken off,
5 4583 And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this Slaue,
5 4584 If there be any cunning Crueltie,
5 4585 That can torment him much, and hold him long,
5 4586 It shall be his. You shall close Prisoner rest,
5 4587 Till that the Nature of your fault be knowne
5 4588 To the Venetian State. Come, bring away
5 4589 
5 4590    Oth. Soft you; a word or two before you goe:
5 4591 I haue done the State some seruice, and they know't:
5 4592 No more of that. I pray you in your Letters,
5 4593 When you shall these vnluckie deeds relate,
5 4594 Speake of me, as I am. Nothing extenuate,
5 4595 Nor set downe ought in malice.
5 4596 Then must you speake,
5 4597 Of one that lou'd not wisely, but too well:
5 4598 Of one, not easily Iealious, but being wrought,
5 4599 Perplexed in the extreame: Of one, whose hand
5 4600 (Like the base Iudean) threw a Pearle away
5 4601 Richer then all his Tribe: Of one, whose subdu'd Eyes,
5 4602 Albeit vn-vsed to the melting moode,
5 4603 Drops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees
5 4604 Their Medicinable gumme. Set you downe this:
5 4605 And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
5 4606 Where a malignant, and a Turbond-Turke
5 4607 Beate a Venetian, and traduc'd the State,
5 4608 I tooke by th' throat the circumcised Dogge,
5 4609 And smoate him, thus
5 4610 
5 4611    Lod. Oh bloody period
5 4612 
5 4613    Gra. All that is spoke, is marr'd
5 4614 
5 4615    Oth. I kist thee, ere I kill'd thee: No way but this,
5 4616 Killing my selfe, to dye vpon a kisse.
5 4617 
5 4618 Dyes
5 4619 
5 4620   Cas. This did I feare, but thought he had no weapon:
5 4621 For he was great of heart
5 4622 
5 4623    Lod. Oh Sparton Dogge:
5 4624 More fell then Anguish, Hunger, or the Sea:
5 4625 Looke on the Tragicke Loading of this bed:
5 4626 This is thy worke:
5 4627 The Obiect poysons Sight,
5 4628 Let it be hid. Gratiano, keepe the house,
5 4629 And seize vpon the Fortunes of the Moore,
5 4630 For they succeede on you. To you, Lord Gouernor,
5 4631 Remaines the Censure of this hellish villaine:
5 4632 The Time, the Place, the Torture, oh inforce it:
5 4633 My selfe will straight aboord, and to the State,
5 4634 This heauie Act, with heauie heart relate.
5 4635 
5 4636 Exeunt.
