13 0 The Life of Henry the Fift
13 1 
13 2 Enter Prologue.
13 3 
13 4 O For a Muse of Fire, that would ascend
13 5 The brightest Heauen of Inuention:
13 6 A Kingdome for a Stage, Princes to Act,
13 7 And Monarchs to behold the swelling Scene.
13 8 Then should the Warlike Harry, like himselfe,
13 9 Assume the Port of Mars, and at his heeles
13 10 (Leasht in, like Hounds) should Famine, Sword, and Fire
13 11 Crouch for employment. But pardon, Gentles all:
13 12 The flat vnraysed Spirits, that hath dar'd,
13 13 On this vnworthy Scaffold, to bring forth
13 14 So great an Obiect. Can this Cock-Pit hold
13 15 The vastie fields of France? Or may we cramme
13 16 Within this Woodden O, the very Caskes
13 17 That did affright the Ayre at Agincourt?
13 18 O pardon: since a crooked Figure may
13 19 Attest in little place a Million,
13 20 And let vs, Cyphers to this great Accompt,
13 21 On your imaginarie Forces worke.
13 22 Suppose within the Girdle of these Walls
13 23 Are now confin'd two mightie Monarchies,
13 24 Whose high, vp-reared, and abutting Fronts,
13 25 The perillous narrow Ocean parts asunder.
13 26 Peece out our imperfections with your thoughts:
13 27 Into a thousand parts diuide one Man,
13 28 And make imaginarie Puissance.
13 29 Thinke when we talke of Horses, that you see them
13 30 Printing their prowd Hoofes i'th' receiuing Earth:
13 31 For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our Kings,
13 32 Carry them here and there: Iumping o're Times;
13 33 Turning th' accomplishment of many yeeres
13 34 Into an Howre-glasse: for the which supplie,
13 35 Admit me Chorus to this Historie;
13 36 Who Prologue-like, your humble patience pray,
13 37 Gently to heare, kindly to iudge our Play.
13 38 Enter.
13 39 
13 40 
13 41 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
13 42 
13 43 Enter the two Bishops of Canterbury and Ely.
13 44 
13 45   Bish.Cant. My Lord, Ile tell you, that selfe Bill is vrg'd,
13 46 Which in th' eleue[n]th yere of y last Kings reign
13 47 Was like, and had indeed against vs past,
13 48 But that the scambling and vnquiet time
13 49 Did push it out of farther question
13 50 
13 51    Bish.Ely. But how my Lord shall we resist it now?
13 52   Bish.Cant. It must be thought on: if it passe against vs,
13 53 We loose the better halfe of our Possession:
13 54 For all the Temporall Lands, which men deuout
13 55 By Testament haue giuen to the Church,
13 56 Would they strip from vs; being valu'd thus,
13 57 As much as would maintaine, to the Kings honor,
13 58 Full fifteene Earles, and fifteene hundred Knights,
13 59 Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires:
13 60 And to reliefe of Lazars, and weake age
13 61 Of indigent faint Soules, past corporall toyle,
13 62 A hundred Almes-houses, right well supply'd:
13 63 And to the Coffers of the King beside,
13 64 A thousand pounds by th' yeere. Thus runs the Bill
13 65 
13 66    Bish.Ely. This would drinke deepe
13 67 
13 68    Bish.Cant. 'Twould drinke the Cup and all
13 69 
13 70    Bish.Ely. But what preuention?
13 71   Bish.Cant. The King is full of grace, and faire regard
13 72 
13 73    Bish.Ely. And a true louer of the holy Church
13 74 
13 75    Bish.Cant. The courses of his youth promis'd it not.
13 76 The breath no sooner left his Fathers body,
13 77 But that his wildnesse, mortify'd in him,
13 78 Seem'd to dye too: yea, at that very moment,
13 79 Consideration like an Angell came,
13 80 And whipt th' offending Adam out of him;
13 81 Leauing his body as a Paradise,
13 82 T' inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits.
13 83 Neuer was such a sodaine Scholler made:
13 84 Neuer came Reformation in a Flood,
13 85 With such a heady currance scowring faults:
13 86 Nor neuer Hidra-headed Wilfulnesse
13 87 So soone did loose his Seat; and all at once;
13 88 As in this King
13 89 
13 90    Bish.Ely. We are blessed in the Change
13 91 
13 92    Bish.Cant. Heare him but reason in Diuinitie;
13 93 And all-admiring, with an inward wish
13 94 You would desire the King were made a Prelate:
13 95 Heare him debate of Common-wealth Affaires;
13 96 You would say, it hath been all in all his study:
13 97 List his discourse of Warre; and you shall heare
13 98 A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique.
13 99 Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy,
13 100 The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose,
13 101 Familiar as his Garter: that when he speakes,
13 102 The Ayre, a Charter'd Libertine, is still,
13 103 And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares,
13 104 To steale his sweet and honyed Sentences:
13 105 So that the Art and Practique part of Life,
13 106 Must be the Mistresse to this Theorique.
13 107 Which is a wonder how his Grace should gleane it,
13 108 Since his addiction was to Courses vaine,
13 109 His Companies vnletter'd, rude, and shallow,
13 110 His Houres fill'd vp with Ryots, Banquets, Sports;
13 111 And neuer noted in him any studie,
13 112 Any retyrement, any sequestration,
13 113 From open Haunts and Popularitie
13 114 
13 115    B.Ely. The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle,
13 116 And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best,
13 117 Neighbour'd by Fruit of baser qualitie:
13 118 And so the Prince obscur'd his Contemplation
13 119 Vnder the Veyle of Wildnesse, which (no doubt)
13 120 Grew like the Summer Grasse, fastest by Night,
13 121 Vnseene, yet cressiue in his facultie
13 122 
13 123    B.Cant. It must be so; for Miracles are ceast:
13 124 And therefore we must needes admit the meanes,
13 125 How things are perfected
13 126 
13 127    B.Ely. But my good Lord:
13 128 How now for mittigation of this Bill,
13 129 Vrg'd by the Commons? doth his Maiestie
13 130 Incline to it, or no?
13 131   B.Cant. He seemes indifferent:
13 132 Or rather swaying more vpon our part,
13 133 Then cherishing th' exhibiters against vs:
13 134 For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie,
13 135 Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation,
13 136 And in regard of Causes now in hand,
13 137 Which I haue open'd to his Grace at large,
13 138 As touching France, to giue a greater Summe,
13 139 Then euer at one time the Clergie yet
13 140 Did to his Predecessors part withall
13 141 
13 142    B.Ely. How did this offer seeme receiu'd, my Lord?
13 143   B.Cant. With good acceptance of his Maiestie:
13 144 Saue that there was not time enough to heare,
13 145 As I perceiu'd his Grace would faine haue done,
13 146 The seueralls and vnhidden passages
13 147 Of his true Titles to some certaine Dukedomes,
13 148 And generally, to the Crowne and Seat of France,
13 149 Deriu'd from Edward, his great Grandfather
13 150 
13 151    B.Ely. What was th' impediment that broke this off?
13 152   B.Cant. The French Embassador vpon that instant
13 153 Crau'd audience; and the howre I thinke is come,
13 154 To giue him hearing: Is it foure a Clock?
13 155   B.Ely. It is
13 156 
13 157    B.Cant. Then goe we in, to know his Embassie:
13 158 Which I could with a ready guesse declare,
13 159 Before the Frenchman speake a word of it
13 160 
13 161    B.Ely. Ile wait vpon you, and I long to heare it.
13 162 
13 163 Exeunt.
13 164 
13 165 Enter the King, Humfrey, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick,
13 166 Westmerland, and
13 167 Exeter.
13 168 
13 169   King. Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
13 170   Exeter. Not here in presence
13 171 
13 172    King. Send for him, good Vnckle
13 173 
13 174    Westm. Shall we call in th' Ambassador, my Liege?
13 175   King. Not yet, my Cousin: we would be resolu'd,
13 176 Before we heare him, of some things of weight,
13 177 That taske our thoughts, concerning vs and France.
13 178 Enter two Bishops.
13 179 
13 180   B.Cant. God and his Angels guard your sacred Throne,
13 181 And make you long become it
13 182 
13 183    King. Sure we thanke you.
13 184 My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed,
13 185 And iustly and religiously vnfold,
13 186 Why the Law Salike, that they haue in France,
13 187 Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme:
13 188 And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord,
13 189 That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
13 190 Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule,
13 191 With opening Titles miscreate, whose right
13 192 Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:
13 193 For God doth know, how many now in health,
13 194 Shall drop their blood, in approbation
13 195 Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to.
13 196 Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person,
13 197 How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre;
13 198 We charge you in the Name of God take heed:
13 199 For neuer two such Kingdomes did contend,
13 200 Without much fall of blood, whose guiltlesse drops
13 201 Are euery one, a Woe, a sore Complaint,
13 202 'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords,
13 203 That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie.
13 204 Vnder this Coniuration, speake my Lord:
13 205 For we will heare, note, and beleeue in heart,
13 206 That what you speake, is in your Conscience washt,
13 207 As pure as sinne with Baptisme
13 208 
13 209    B.Can. Then heare me gracious Soueraign, & you Peers,
13 210 That owe your selues, your liues, and seruices,
13 211 To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre
13 212 To make against your Highnesse Clayme to France,
13 213 But this which they produce from Pharamond,
13 214 In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant,
13 215 No Woman shall succeed in Salike Land:
13 216 Which Salike Land, the French vniustly gloze
13 217 To be the Realme of France, and Pharamond
13 218 The founder of this Law, and Female Barre.
13 219 Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme,
13 220 That the Land Salike is in Germanie,
13 221 Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue:
13 222 Where Charles the Great hauing subdu'd the Saxons,
13 223 There left behind and settled certaine French:
13 224 Who holding in disdaine the German Women,
13 225 For some dishonest manners of their life,
13 226 Establisht then this Law; to wit, No Female
13 227 Should be Inheritrix in Salike Land:
13 228 Which Salike (as I said) 'twixt Elue and Sala,
13 229 Is at this day in Germanie, call'd Meisen.
13 230 Then doth it well appeare, the Salike Law
13 231 Was not deuised for the Realme of France:
13 232 Nor did the French possesse the Salike Land,
13 233 Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres
13 234 After defunction of King Pharamond,
13 235 Idly suppos'd the founder of this Law,
13 236 Who died within the yeere of our Redemption,
13 237 Foure hundred twentie six: and Charles the Great
13 238 Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French
13 239 Beyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere
13 240 Eight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers say,
13 241 King Pepin, which deposed Childerike,
13 242 Did as Heire Generall, being descended
13 243 Of Blithild, which was Daughter to King Clothair,
13 244 Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France.
13 245 Hugh Capet also, who vsurpt the Crowne
13 246 Of Charles the Duke of Loraine, sole Heire male
13 247 Of the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great:
13 248 To find his Title with some shewes of truth,
13 249 Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,
13 250 Conuey'd himselfe as th' Heire to th' Lady Lingare,
13 251 Daughter to Charlemaine, who was the Sonne
13 252 To Lewes the Emperour, and Lewes the Sonne
13 253 Of Charles the Great: also King Lewes the Tenth,
13 254 Who was sole Heire to the Vsurper Capet,
13 255 Could not keepe quiet in his conscience,
13 256 Wearing the Crowne of France, 'till satisfied,
13 257 That faire Queene Isabel, his Grandmother,
13 258 Was Lineall of the Lady Ermengare,
13 259 Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine:
13 260 By the which Marriage, the Lyne of Charles the Great
13 261 Was re-vnited to the Crowne of France.
13 262 So, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne,
13 263 King Pepins Title, and Hugh Capets Clayme,
13 264 King Lewes his satisfaction, all appeare
13 265 To hold in Right and Title of the Female:
13 266 So doe the Kings of France vnto this day.
13 267 Howbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law,
13 268 To barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female,
13 269 And rather chuse to hide them in a Net,
13 270 Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles,
13 271 Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors
13 272 
13 273    King. May I with right and conscience make this claim?
13 274   Bish.Cant. The sinne vpon my head, dread Soueraigne:
13 275 For in the Booke of Numbers is it writ,
13 276 When the man dyes, let the Inheritance
13 277 Descend vnto the Daughter. Gracious Lord,
13 278 Stand for your owne, vnwind your bloody Flagge,
13 279 Looke back into your mightie Ancestors:
13 280 Goe my dread Lord, to your great Grandsires Tombe,
13 281 From whom you clayme; inuoke his Warlike Spirit,
13 282 And your Great Vnckles, Edward the Black Prince,
13 283 Who on the French ground play'd a Tragedie,
13 284 Making defeat on the full Power of France:
13 285 Whiles his most mightie Father on a Hill
13 286 Stood smiling, to behold his Lyons Whelpe
13 287 Forrage in blood of French Nobilitie.
13 288 O Noble English, that could entertaine
13 289 With halfe their Forces, the full pride of France,
13 290 And let another halfe stand laughing by,
13 291 All out of worke, and cold for action
13 292 
13 293    Bish. Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
13 294 And with your puissant Arme renew their Feats;
13 295 You are their Heire, you sit vpon their Throne:
13 296 The Blood and Courage that renowned them,
13 297 Runs in your Veines: and my thrice-puissant Liege
13 298 Is in the very May-Morne of his Youth,
13 299 Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises
13 300 
13 301    Exe. Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth
13 302 Doe all expect, that you should rowse your selfe,
13 303 As did the former Lyons of your Blood
13 304 
13 305    West. They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;
13 306 So hath your Highnesse: neuer King of England
13 307 Had Nobles richer, and more loyall Subiects,
13 308 Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England,
13 309 And lye pauillion'd in the fields of France
13 310 
13 311    Bish.Can. O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege
13 312 With Bloods, and Sword and Fire, to win your Right:
13 313 In ayde whereof, we of the Spiritualtie
13 314 Will rayse your Highnesse such a mightie Summe,
13 315 As neuer did the Clergie at one time
13 316 Bring in to any of your Ancestors
13 317 
13 318    King. We must not onely arme t' inuade the French,
13 319 But lay downe our proportions, to defend
13 320 Against the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs,
13 321 With all aduantages
13 322 
13 323    Bish.Can. They of those Marches, gracious Soueraign,
13 324 Shall be a Wall sufficient to defend
13 325 Our in-land from the pilfering Borderers
13 326 
13 327    King. We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely,
13 328 But feare the maine intendment of the Scot,
13 329 Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs:
13 330 For you shall reade, that my great Grandfather
13 331 Neuer went with his forces into France,
13 332 But that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome,
13 333 Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach,
13 334 With ample and brim fulnesse of his force,
13 335 Galling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes,
13 336 Girding with grieuous siege, Castles and Townes:
13 337 That England being emptie of defence,
13 338 Hath shooke and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood
13 339 
13 340    B.Can. She hath bin the[n] more fear'd the[n] harm'd, my Liege:
13 341 For heare her but exampl'd by her selfe,
13 342 When all her Cheualrie hath been in France,
13 343 And shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles,
13 344 Shee hath her selfe not onely well defended,
13 345 But taken and impounded as a Stray,
13 346 The King of Scots: whom shee did send to France,
13 347 To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings,
13 348 And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse,
13 349 As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea
13 350 With sunken Wrack, and sum-lesse Treasuries
13 351 
13 352    Bish.Ely. But there's a saying very old and true,
13 353 If that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin.
13 354 For once the Eagle (England) being in prey,
13 355 To her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot)
13 356 Comes sneaking, and so sucks her Princely Egges,
13 357 Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat,
13 358 To tame and hauocke more then she can eate
13 359 
13 360    Exet. It followes then, the Cat must stay at home,
13 361 Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
13 362 Since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries,
13 363 And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues.
13 364 While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad,
13 365 Th' aduised head defends it selfe at home:
13 366 For Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower,
13 367 Put into parts, doth keepe in one consent,
13 368 Congreeing in a full and natural close,
13 369 Like Musicke
13 370 
13 371    Cant. Therefore doth heauen diuide
13 372 The state of man in diuers functions,
13 373 Setting endeuour in continual motion:
13 374 To which is fixed as an ayme or butt,
13 375 Obedience: for so worke the Hony Bees,
13 376 Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach
13 377 The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome.
13 378 They haue a King, and Officers of sorts,
13 379 Where some like Magistrates correct at home:
13 380 Others, like Merchants venter Trade abroad:
13 381 Others, like Souldiers armed in their stings,
13 382 Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes:
13 383 Which pillage, they with merry march bring home
13 384 To the Tent-royal of their Emperor:
13 385 Who busied in his Maiesties surueyes
13 386 The singing Masons building roofes of Gold,
13 387 The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony;
13 388 The poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in
13 389 Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate:
13 390 The sad-ey'd Iustice with his surly humme,
13 391 Deliuering ore to Executors pale
13 392 The lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre,
13 393 That many things hauing full reference
13 394 To one consent, may worke contrariously,
13 395 As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes
13 396 Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne,
13 397 As many fresh streames meet in one salt sea;
13 398 As many Lynes close in the Dials center:
13 399 So may a thousand actions once a foote,
13 400 And in one purpose, and be all well borne
13 401 Without defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege,
13 402 Diuide your happy England into foure,
13 403 Whereof, take you one quarter into France,
13 404 And you withall shall make all Gallia shake.
13 405 If we with thrice such powers left at home,
13 406 Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,
13 407 Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose
13 408 The name of hardinesse and policie
13 409 
13 410    King. Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin.
13 411 Now are we well resolu'd, and by Gods helpe
13 412 And yours, the noble sinewes of our power,
13 413 France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe,
13 414 Or breake it all to peeces. Or there wee'l sit,
13 415 (Ruling in large and ample Emperie,
13 416 Ore France, and all her (almost) Kingly Dukedomes)
13 417 Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne,
13 418 Tomblesse, with no remembrance ouer them:
13 419 Either our History shall with full mouth
13 420 Speake freely of our Acts, or else our graue
13 421 Like Turkish mute, shall haue a tonguelesse mouth,
13 422 Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph.
13 423 Enter Ambassadors of France.
13 424 
13 425 Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure
13 426 Of our faire Cosin Dolphin: for we heare,
13 427 Your greeting is from him, not from the King
13 428 
13 429    Amb. May't please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue
13 430 Freely to render what we haue in charge:
13 431 Or shall we sparingly shew you farre off
13 432 The Dolphins meaning, and our Embassie
13 433 
13 434    King. We are no Tyrant, but a Christian King,
13 435 Vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect
13 436 As is our wretches fettred in our prisons,
13 437 Therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse,
13 438 Tell vs the Dolphins minde
13 439 
13 440    Amb. Thus than in few:
13 441 Your Highnesse lately sending into France,
13 442 Did claime some certaine Dukedomes, in the right
13 443 Of your great Predecessor, King Edward the third.
13 444 In answer of which claime, the Prince our Master
13 445 Sayes, that you sauour too much of your youth,
13 446 And bids you be aduis'd: There's nought in France,
13 447 That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne:
13 448 You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there.
13 449 He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
13 450 This Tun of Treasure; and in lieu of this,
13 451 Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime
13 452 Heare no more of you. This the Dolphin speakes
13 453 
13 454    King. What Treasure Vncle?
13 455   Exe. Tennis balles, my Liege
13 456 
13 457    Kin. We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs,
13 458 His Present, and your paines we thanke you for:
13 459 When we haue matcht our Rackets to these Balles,
13 460 We will in France (by Gods grace) play a set,
13 461 Shall strike his fathers Crowne into the hazard.
13 462 Tell him, he hath made a match with such a Wrangler,
13 463 That all the Courts of France will be disturb'd
13 464 With Chaces. And we vnderstand him well,
13 465 How he comes o're vs with our wilder dayes,
13 466 Not measuring what vse we made of them.
13 467 We neuer valew'd this poore seate of England,
13 468 And therefore liuing hence, did giue our selfe
13 469 To barbarous license: As 'tis euer common,
13 470 That men are merriest, when they are from home.
13 471 But tell the Dolphin, I will keepe my State,
13 472 Be like a King, and shew my sayle of Greatnesse,
13 473 When I do rowse me in my Throne of France.
13 474 For that I haue layd by my Maiestie,
13 475 And plodded like a man for working dayes:
13 476 But I will rise there with so full a glorie,
13 477 That I will dazle all the eyes of France,
13 478 Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs,
13 479 And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his
13 480 Hath turn'd his balles to Gun-stones, and his soule
13 481 Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance
13 482 That shall flye with them: for many a thousand widows
13 483 Shall this his Mocke, mocke out of their deer husbands;
13 484 Mocke mothers from their sonnes, mock Castles downe:
13 485 And some are yet vngotten and vnborne,
13 486 That shal haue cause to curse the Dolphins scorne.
13 487 But this lyes all within the wil of God,
13 488 To whom I do appeale, and in whose name
13 489 Tel you the Dolphin, I am comming on,
13 490 To venge me as I may, and to put forth
13 491 My rightfull hand in a wel-hallow'd cause.
13 492 So get you hence in peace: And tell the Dolphin,
13 493 His Iest will sauour but of shallow wit,
13 494 When thousands weepe more then did laugh at it.
13 495 Conuey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
13 496 
13 497 Exeunt. Ambassadors.
13 498 
13 499   Exe. This was a merry Message
13 500 
13 501    King. We hope to make the Sender blush at it:
13 502 Therefore, my Lords, omit no happy howre,
13 503 That may giue furth'rance to our Expedition:
13 504 For we haue now no thought in vs but France,
13 505 Saue those to God, that runne before our businesse.
13 506 Therefore let our proportions for these Warres
13 507 Be soone collected, and all things thought vpon,
13 508 That may with reasonable swiftnesse adde
13 509 More Feathers to our Wings: for God before,
13 510 Wee'le chide this Dolphin at his fathers doore.
13 511 Therefore let euery man now taske his thought,
13 512 That this faire Action may on foot be brought.
13 513 
13 514 Exeunt.
13 515 
13 516 Flourish. Enter Chorus.
13 517 
13 518 Now all the Youth of England are on fire,
13 519 And silken Dalliance in the Wardrobe lyes:
13 520 Now thriue the Armorers, and Honors thought
13 521 Reignes solely in the breast of euery man.
13 522 They sell the Pasture now, to buy the Horse;
13 523 Following the Mirror of all Christian Kings,
13 524 With winged heeles, as English Mercuries.
13 525 For now sits Expectation in the Ayre,
13 526 And hides a Sword, from Hilts vnto the Point,
13 527 With Crownes Imperiall, Crownes and Coronets,
13 528 Promis'd to Harry, and his followers.
13 529 The French aduis'd by good intelligence
13 530 Of this most dreadfull preparation,
13 531 Shake in their feare, and with pale Pollicy
13 532 Seeke to diuert the English purposes.
13 533 O England: Modell to thy inward Greatnesse,
13 534 Like little Body with a mightie Heart:
13 535 What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
13 536 Were all thy children kinde and naturall:
13 537 But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,
13 538 A nest of hollow bosomes, which he filles
13 539 With treacherous Crownes, and three corrupted men:
13 540 One, Richard Earle of Cambridge, and the second
13 541 Henry Lord Scroope of Masham, and the third
13 542 Sir Thomas Grey Knight of Northumberland,
13 543 Haue for the Gilt of France (O guilt indeed)
13 544 Confirm'd Conspiracy with fearefull France,
13 545 And by their hands, this grace of Kings must dye.
13 546 If Hell and Treason hold their promises,
13 547 Ere he take ship for France; and in Southampton.
13 548 Linger your patience on, and wee'l digest
13 549 Th' abuse of distance; force a play:
13 550 The summe is payde, the Traitors are agreed,
13 551 The King is set from London, and the Scene
13 552 Is now transported (Gentles) to Southampton,
13 553 There is the Play-house now, there must you sit,
13 554 And thence to France shall we conuey you safe,
13 555 And bring you backe: Charming the narrow seas
13 556 To giue you gentle Passe: for if we may,
13 557 Wee'l not offend one stomacke with our Play.
13 558 But till the King come forth, and not till then,
13 559 Vnto Southampton do we shift our Scene.
13 560 
13 561 Exit
13 562 
13 563 Enter Corporall Nym, and Lieutenant Bardolfe.
13 564 
13 565   Bar. Well met Corporall Nym
13 566 
13 567    Nym. Good morrow Lieutenant Bardolfe
13 568 
13 569    Bar. What, are Ancient Pistoll and you friends yet?
13 570   Nym. For my part, I care not: I say little: but when
13 571 time shall serue, there shall be smiles, but that shall be as
13 572 it may. I dare not fight, but I will winke and holde out
13 573 mine yron: it is a simple one, but what though? It will
13 574 toste Cheese, and it will endure cold, as another mans
13 575 sword will: and there's an end
13 576 
13 577    Bar. I will bestow a breakfast to make you friendes,
13 578 and wee'l bee all three sworne brothers to France: Let't
13 579 be so good Corporall Nym
13 580 
13 581    Nym. Faith, I will liue so long as I may, that's the certaine
13 582 of it: and when I cannot liue any longer, I will doe
13 583 as I may: That is my rest, that is the rendeuous of it
13 584 
13 585    Bar. It is certaine Corporall, that he is marryed to
13 586 Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you
13 587 were troth-plight to her
13 588 
13 589    Nym. I cannot tell, Things must be as they may: men
13 590 may sleepe, and they may haue their throats about them
13 591 at that time, and some say, kniues haue edges: It must
13 592 be as it may, though patience be a tyred name, yet shee
13 593 will plodde, there must be Conclusions, well, I cannot
13 594 tell.
13 595 Enter Pistoll, & Quickly.
13 596 
13 597   Bar. Heere comes Ancient Pistoll and his wife: good
13 598 Corporall be patient heere. How now mine Hoaste Pistoll?
13 599   Pist. Base Tyke, cal'st thou mee Hoste, now by this
13 600 hand I sweare I scorne the terme: nor shall my Nel keep
13 601 Lodgers
13 602 
13 603    Host. No by my troth, not long: For we cannot lodge
13 604 and board a dozen or fourteene Gentlewomen that liue
13 605 honestly by the pricke of their Needles, but it will bee
13 606 thought we keepe a Bawdy-house straight. O welliday
13 607 Lady, if he be not hewne now, we shall see wilful adultery
13 608 and murther committed
13 609 
13 610    Bar. Good Lieutenant, good Corporal offer nothing
13 611 heere
13 612 
13 613    Nym. Pish
13 614 
13 615    Pist. Pish for thee, Island dogge: thou prickeard cur
13 616 of Island
13 617 
13 618    Host. Good Corporall Nym shew thy valor, and put
13 619 vp your sword
13 620 
13 621    Nym. Will you shogge off? I would haue you solus
13 622 
13 623    Pist. Solus, egregious dog? O Viper vile; The solus
13 624 in thy most meruailous face, the solus in thy teeth, and
13 625 in thy throate, and in thy hatefull Lungs, yea in thy Maw
13 626 perdy; and which is worse, within thy nastie mouth. I
13 627 do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can take, and Pistols
13 628 cocke is vp, and flashing fire will follow
13 629 
13 630    Nym. I am not Barbason, you cannot coniure mee: I
13 631 haue an humor to knocke you indifferently well: If you
13 632 grow fowle with me Pistoll, I will scoure you with my
13 633 Rapier, as I may, in fayre tearmes. If you would walke
13 634 off, I would pricke your guts a little in good tearmes, as
13 635 I may, and that's the humor of it
13 636 
13 637    Pist. O Braggard vile, and damned furious wight,
13 638 The Graue doth gape, and doting death is neere,
13 639 Therefore exhale
13 640 
13 641    Bar. Heare me, heare me what I say: Hee that strikes
13 642 the first stroake, Ile run him vp to the hilts, as I am a soldier
13 643 
13 644    Pist. An oath of mickle might, and fury shall abate.
13 645 Giue me thy fist, thy fore-foote to me giue: Thy spirites
13 646 are most tall
13 647 
13 648    Nym. I will cut thy throate one time or other in faire
13 649 termes, that is the humor of it
13 650 
13 651    Pistoll. Couple a gorge, that is the word. I defie thee againe.
13 652 O hound of Creet, think'st thou my spouse to get?
13 653 No, to the spittle goe, and from the Poudring tub of infamy,
13 654 fetch forth the Lazar Kite of Cressids kinde, Doll
13 655 Teare-sheete, she by name, and her espouse. I haue, and I
13 656 will hold the Quondam Quickely for the onely shee: and
13 657 Pauca, there's enough to go to.
13 658 Enter the Boy.
13 659 
13 660   Boy. Mine Hoast Pistoll, you must come to my Mayster,
13 661 and your Hostesse: He is very sicke, & would to bed.
13 662 Good Bardolfe, put thy face betweene his sheets, and do
13 663 the Office of a Warming-pan: Faith, he's very ill
13 664 
13 665    Bard. Away you Rogue
13 666 
13 667    Host. By my troth he'l yeeld the Crow a pudding one
13 668 of these dayes: the King has kild his heart. Good Husband
13 669 come home presently.
13 670 
13 671 Exit
13 672 
13 673   Bar. Come, shall I make you two friends. Wee must
13 674 to France together: why the diuel should we keep kniues
13 675 to cut one anothers throats?
13 676   Pist. Let floods ore-swell, and fiends for food howle
13 677 on
13 678 
13 679    Nym. You'l pay me the eight shillings I won of you
13 680 at Betting?
13 681   Pist. Base is the Slaue that payes
13 682 
13 683    Nym. That now I wil haue: that's the humor of it
13 684 
13 685    Pist. As manhood shal compound: push home.
13 686 
13 687 Draw
13 688 
13 689   Bard. By this sword, hee that makes the first thrust,
13 690 Ile kill him: By this sword, I wil
13 691 
13 692    Pi. Sword is an Oath, & Oaths must haue their course
13 693   Bar. Coporall Nym, & thou wilt be friends be frends,
13 694 and thou wilt not, why then be enemies with me to: prethee
13 695 put vp
13 696 
13 697    Pist. A Noble shalt thou haue, and present pay, and
13 698 Liquor likewise will I giue to thee, and friendshippe
13 699 shall combyne, and brotherhood. Ile liue by Nymme, &
13 700 Nymme shall liue by me, is not this iust? For I shal Sutler
13 701 be vnto the Campe, and profits will accrue. Giue mee
13 702 thy hand
13 703 
13 704    Nym. I shall haue my Noble?
13 705   Pist. In cash, most iustly payd
13 706 
13 707    Nym. Well, then that the humor of't.
13 708 Enter Hostesse.
13 709 
13 710   Host. As euer you come of women, come in quickly
13 711 to sir Iohn: A poore heart, hee is so shak'd of a burning
13 712 quotidian Tertian, that it is most lamentable to behold.
13 713 Sweet men, come to him
13 714 
13 715    Nym. The King hath run bad humors on the Knight,
13 716 that's the euen of it
13 717 
13 718    Pist. Nym, thou hast spoke the right, his heart is fracted
13 719 and corroborate
13 720 
13 721    Nym. The King is a good King, but it must bee as it
13 722 may: he passes some humors, and carreeres
13 723 
13 724    Pist. Let vs condole the Knight, for (Lambekins) we
13 725 will liue.
13 726 Enter Exeter, Bedford, & Westmerland.
13 727 
13 728   Bed. Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors
13 729   Exe. They shall be apprehended by and by
13 730 
13 731    West. How smooth and euen they do bear themselues,
13 732 As if allegeance in their bosomes sate
13 733 Crowned with faith, and constant loyalty
13 734 
13 735    Bed. The King hath note of all that they intend,
13 736 By interception, which they dreame not of
13 737 
13 738    Exe. Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
13 739 Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious fauours;
13 740 That he should for a forraigne purse, so sell
13 741 His Soueraignes life to death and treachery.
13 742 
13 743 Sound Trumpets.
13 744 
13 745 Enter the King, Scroope, Cambridge, and Gray.
13 746 
13 747   King. Now sits the winde faire, and we will aboord.
13 748 My Lord of Cambridge, and my kinde Lord of Masham,
13 749 And you my gentle Knight, giue me your thoughts:
13 750 Thinke you not that the powres we beare with vs
13 751 Will cut their passage through the force of France?
13 752 Doing the execution, and the acte,
13 753 For which we haue in head assembled them
13 754 
13 755    Scro. No doubt my Liege, if each man do his best
13 756 
13 757    King. I doubt not that, since we are well perswaded
13 758 We carry not a heart with vs from hence,
13 759 That growes not in a faire consent with ours:
13 760 Nor leaue not one behinde, that doth not wish
13 761 Successe and Conquest to attend on vs
13 762 
13 763    Cam. Neuer was Monarch better fear'd and lou'd,
13 764 Then is your Maiesty; there's not I thinke a subiect
13 765 That sits in heart-greefe and vneasinesse
13 766 Vnder the sweet shade of your gouernment
13 767 
13 768    Kni. True: those that were your Fathers enemies,
13 769 Haue steep'd their gauls in hony, and do serue you
13 770 With hearts create of duty, and of zeale
13 771 
13 772    King. We therefore haue great cause of thankfulnes,
13 773 And shall forget the office of our hand
13 774 Sooner then quittance of desert and merit,
13 775 According to the weight and worthinesse
13 776 
13 777    Scro. So seruice shall with steeled sinewes toyle,
13 778 And labour shall refresh it selfe with hope
13 779 To do your Grace incessant seruices
13 780 
13 781    King. We Iudge no lesse. Vnkle of Exeter,
13 782 Inlarge the man committed yesterday,
13 783 That rayl'd against our person: We consider
13 784 It was excesse of Wine that set him on,
13 785 And on his more aduice, We pardon him
13 786 
13 787    Scro. That's mercy, but too much security:
13 788 Let him be punish'd Soueraigne, least example
13 789 Breed (by his sufferance) more of such a kind
13 790 
13 791    King. O let vs yet be mercifull
13 792 
13 793    Cam. So may your Highnesse, and yet punish too
13 794 
13 795    Grey. Sir, you shew great mercy if you giue him life,
13 796 After the taste of much correction
13 797 
13 798    King. Alas, your too much loue and care of me,
13 799 Are heauy Orisons 'gainst this poore wretch:
13 800 If little faults proceeding on distemper,
13 801 Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
13 802 When capitall crimes, chew'd, swallow'd, and digested,
13 803 Appeare before vs? Wee'l yet inlarge that man,
13 804 Though Cambridge, Scroope, and Gray, in their deere care
13 805 And tender preseruation of our person
13 806 Wold haue him punish'd. And now to our French causes,
13 807 Who are the late Commissioners?
13 808   Cam. I one my Lord,
13 809 Your Highnesse bad me aske for it to day
13 810 
13 811    Scro. So did you me my Liege
13 812 
13 813    Gray. And I my Royall Soueraigne
13 814 
13 815    King. Then Richard Earle of Cambridge, there is yours:
13 816 There yours Lord Scroope of Masham, and Sir Knight:
13 817 Gray of Northumberland, this same is yours:
13 818 Reade them, and know I know your worthinesse.
13 819 My Lord of Westmerland, and Vnkle Exeter,
13 820 We will aboord to night. Why how now Gentlemen?
13 821 What see you in those papers, that you loose
13 822 So much complexion? Looke ye how they change:
13 823 Their cheekes are paper. Why, what reade you there,
13 824 That haue so cowarded and chac'd your blood
13 825 Out of apparance
13 826 
13 827    Cam. I do confesse my fault,
13 828 And do submit me to your Highnesse mercy
13 829 
13 830    Gray. Scro. To which we all appeale
13 831 
13 832    King. The mercy that was quicke in vs but late,
13 833 By your owne counsaile is supprest and kill'd:
13 834 You must not dare (for shame) to talke of mercy,
13 835 For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes,
13 836 As dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you:
13 837 See you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres,
13 838 These English monsters: My Lord of Cambridge heere,
13 839 You know how apt our loue was, to accord
13 840 To furnish with all appertinents
13 841 Belonging to his Honour; and this man,
13 842 Hath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir'd
13 843 And sworne vnto the practises of France
13 844 To kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which,
13 845 This Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs
13 846 Then Cambridge is, hath likewise sworne. But O,
13 847 What shall I say to thee Lord Scroope, thou cruell,
13 848 Ingratefull, sauage, and inhumane Creature?
13 849 Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes,
13 850 That knew'st the very bottome of my soule,
13 851 That (almost) might'st haue coyn'd me into Golde,
13 852 Would'st thou haue practis'd on me, for thy vse?
13 853 May it be possible, that forraigne hyer
13 854 Could out of thee extract one sparke of euill
13 855 That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange,
13 856 That though the truth of it stands off as grosse
13 857 As black and white, my eye will scarsely see it.
13 858 Treason, and murther, euer kept together,
13 859 As two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose,
13 860 Working so grossely in an naturall cause,
13 861 That admiration did not hoope at them.
13 862 But thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in
13 863 Wonder to waite on treason, and on murther:
13 864 And whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was
13 865 That wrought vpon thee so preposterously,
13 866 Hath got the voyce in hell for excellence:
13 867 And other diuels that suggest by treasons,
13 868 Do botch and bungle vp damnation,
13 869 With patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht
13 870 From glist'ring semblances of piety:
13 871 But he that temper'd thee, bad thee stand vp,
13 872 Gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
13 873 Vnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor.
13 874 If that same Daemon that hath gull'd thee thus,
13 875 Should with his Lyon-gate walke the whole world,
13 876 He might returne to vastie Tartar backe,
13 877 And tell the Legions, I can neuer win
13 878 A soule so easie as that Englishmans.
13 879 Oh, how hast thou with iealousie infected
13 880 The sweetnesse of affiance? Shew men dutifull,
13 881 Why so didst thou: seeme they graue and learned?
13 882 Why so didst thou. Come they of Noble Family?
13 883 Why so didst thou. Seeme they religious?
13 884 Why so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,
13 885 Free from grosse passion, or of mirth, or anger,
13 886 Constant in spirit, not sweruing with the blood,
13 887 Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
13 888 Not working with the eye, without the eare,
13 889 And but in purged iudgement trusting neither,
13 890 Such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme:
13 891 And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot,
13 892 To make thee full fraught man, and best indued
13 893 With some suspition, I will weepe for thee.
13 894 For this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like
13 895 Another fall of Man. Their faults are open,
13 896 Arrest them to the answer of the Law,
13 897 And God acquit them of their practises
13 898 
13 899    Exe. I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of
13 900 Richard Earle of Cambridge.
13 901 I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas
13 902 Lord Scroope of Marsham.
13 903 I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas
13 904 Grey, Knight of Northumberland
13 905 
13 906    Scro. Our purposes, God iustly hath discouer'd,
13 907 And I repent my fault more then my death,
13 908 Which I beseech your Highnesse to forgiue,
13 909 Although my body pay the price of it
13 910 
13 911    Cam. For me, the Gold of France did not seduce,
13 912 Although I did admit it as a motiue,
13 913 The sooner to effect what I intended:
13 914 But God be thanked for preuention,
13 915 Which in sufferance heartily will reioyce,
13 916 Beseeching God, and you, to pardon mee
13 917 
13 918    Gray. Neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce
13 919 At the discouery of most dangerous Treason,
13 920 Then I do at this houre ioy ore my selfe,
13 921 Preuented from a damned enterprize;
13 922 My fault, but not my body, pardon Soueraigne
13 923 
13 924    King. God quit you in his mercy: Hear your sentence
13 925 You haue conspir'd against Our Royall person,
13 926 Ioyn'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his Coffers,
13 927 Receyu'd the Golden Earnest of Our death:
13 928 Wherein you would haue sold your King to slaughter,
13 929 His Princes, and his Peeres to seruitude,
13 930 His Subiects to oppression, and contempt,
13 931 And his whole Kingdome into desolation:
13 932 Touching our person, seeke we no reuenge,
13 933 But we our Kingdomes safety must so tender,
13 934 Whose ruine you sought, that to her Lawes
13 935 We do deliuer you. Get you therefore hence,
13 936 (Poore miserable wretches) to your death:
13 937 The taste whereof, God of his mercy giue
13 938 You patience to indure, and true Repentance
13 939 Of all your deare offences. Beare them hence.
13 940 Enter.
13 941 
13 942 Now Lords for France: the enterprise whereof
13 943 Shall be to you as vs, like glorious.
13 944 We doubt not of a faire and luckie Warre,
13 945 Since God so graciously hath brought to light
13 946 This dangerous Treason, lurking in our way,
13 947 To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now,
13 948 But euery Rubbe is smoothed on our way.
13 949 Then forth, deare Countreymen: Let vs deliuer
13 950 Our Puissance into the hand of God,
13 951 Putting it straight in expedition.
13 952 Chearely to Sea, the signes of Warre aduance,
13 953 No King of England, if not King of France.
13 954 
13 955 Flourish.
13 956 
13 957 Enter Pistoll, Nim, Bardolph, Boy, and Hostesse.
13 958 
13 959   Hostesse. 'Prythee honey sweet Husband, let me bring
13 960 thee to Staines
13 961 
13 962    Pistoll. No: for my manly heart doth erne. Bardolph,
13 963 be blythe: Nim, rowse thy vaunting Veines: Boy, brissle
13 964 thy Courage vp: for Falstaffe hee is dead, and wee must
13 965 erne therefore
13 966 
13 967    Bard. Would I were with him, wheresomere hee is,
13 968 eyther in Heauen, or in Hell
13 969 
13 970    Hostesse. Nay sure, hee's not in Hell: hee's in Arthurs
13 971 Bosome, if euer man went to Arthurs Bosome: a made a
13 972 finer end, and went away and it had beene any Christome
13 973 Childe: a parted eu'n iust betweene Twelue and One, eu'n
13 974 at the turning o'th' Tyde: for after I saw him fumble with
13 975 the Sheets, and play with Flowers, and smile vpon his fingers
13 976 end, I knew there was but one way: for his Nose was
13 977 as sharpe as a Pen, and a Table of greene fields. How now
13 978 Sir Iohn (quoth I?) what man? be a good cheare: so a
13 979 cryed out, God, God, God, three or foure times: now I,
13 980 to comfort him, bid him a should not thinke of God; I
13 981 hop'd there was no neede to trouble himselfe with any
13 982 such thoughts yet: so a bad me lay more Clothes on his
13 983 feet: I put my hand into the Bed, and felt them, and they
13 984 were as cold as any stone: then I felt to his knees, and so
13 985 vp-peer'd, and vpward, and all was as cold as any stone
13 986 
13 987    Nim. They say he cryed out of Sack
13 988 
13 989    Hostesse. I, that a did
13 990 
13 991    Bard. And of Women
13 992 
13 993    Hostesse. Nay, that a did not
13 994 
13 995    Boy. Yes that a did, and said they were Deules incarnate
13 996 
13 997    Woman. A could neuer abide Carnation, 'twas a Colour
13 998 he neuer lik'd
13 999 
13 1000    Boy. A said once, the Deule would haue him about
13 1001 Women
13 1002 
13 1003    Hostesse. A did in some sort (indeed) handle Women:
13 1004 but then hee was rumatique, and talk'd of the Whore of
13 1005 Babylon
13 1006 
13 1007    Boy. Doe you not remember a saw a Flea sticke vpon
13 1008 Bardolphs Nose, and a said it was a blacke Soule burning
13 1009 in Hell
13 1010 
13 1011    Bard. Well, the fuell is gone that maintain'd that fire:
13 1012 that's all the Riches I got in his seruice
13 1013 
13 1014    Nim. Shall wee shogg? the King will be gone from
13 1015 Southampton
13 1016 
13 1017    Pist. Come, let's away. My Loue, giue me thy Lippes:
13 1018 Looke to my Chattels, and my Moueables: Let Sences
13 1019 rule: The world is, Pitch and pay: trust none: for Oathes
13 1020 are Strawes, mens Faiths are Wafer-Cakes, and hold-fast
13 1021 is the onely Dogge: My Ducke, therefore Caueto bee
13 1022 thy Counsailor. Goe, cleare thy Chrystalls. Yokefellowes
13 1023 in Armes, let vs to France, like Horseleeches
13 1024 my Boyes, to sucke, to sucke, the very blood to
13 1025 sucke
13 1026 
13 1027    Boy. And that's but vnwholesome food, they say
13 1028 
13 1029    Pist. Touch her soft mouth, and march
13 1030 
13 1031    Bard. Farwell Hostesse
13 1032 
13 1033    Nim. I cannot kisse, that is the humor of it: but
13 1034 adieu
13 1035 
13 1036    Pist. Let Huswiferie appeare: keepe close, I thee
13 1037 command
13 1038 
13 1039    Hostesse. Farwell: adieu.
13 1040 
13 1041 Exeunt.
13 1042 
13 1043 Flourish.
13 1044 
13 1045 Enter the French King, the Dolphin, the Dukes of Berry and
13 1046 Britaine.
13 1047 
13 1048   King. Thus comes the English with full power vpon vs,
13 1049 And more then carefully it vs concernes,
13 1050 To answer Royally in our defences.
13 1051 Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Britaine,
13 1052 Of Brabant and of Orleance, shall make forth,
13 1053 And you Prince Dolphin, with all swift dispatch
13 1054 To lyne and new repayre our Townes of Warre
13 1055 With men of courage, and with meanes defendant:
13 1056 For England his approaches makes as fierce,
13 1057 As Waters to the sucking of a Gulfe.
13 1058 It fits vs then to be as prouident,
13 1059 As feare may teach vs, out of late examples
13 1060 Left by the fatall and neglected English,
13 1061 Vpon our fields
13 1062 
13 1063    Dolphin. My most redoubted Father,
13 1064 It is most meet we arme vs 'gainst the Foe:
13 1065 For Peace it selfe should not so dull a Kingdome,
13 1066 (Though War nor no knowne Quarrel were in question)
13 1067 But that Defences, Musters, Preparations,
13 1068 Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected,
13 1069 As were a Warre in expectation.
13 1070 Therefore I say, 'tis meet we all goe forth,
13 1071 To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
13 1072 And let vs doe it with no shew of feare,
13 1073 No, with no more, then if we heard that England
13 1074 Were busied with a Whitson Morris-dance:
13 1075 For, my good Liege, shee is so idly King'd,
13 1076 Her Scepter so phantastically borne,
13 1077 By a vaine giddie shallow humorous Youth,
13 1078 That feare attends her not
13 1079 
13 1080    Const. O peace, Prince Dolphin,
13 1081 You are too much mistaken in this King:
13 1082 Question your Grace the late Embassadors,
13 1083 With what great State he heard their Embassie,
13 1084 How well supply'd with Noble Councellors,
13 1085 How modest in exception; and withall,
13 1086 How terrible in constant resolution:
13 1087 And you shall find, his Vanities fore-spent,
13 1088 Were but the out-side of the Roman Brutus,
13 1089 Couering Discretion with a Coat of Folly;
13 1090 As Gardeners doe with Ordure hide those Roots
13 1091 That shall first spring, and be most delicate
13 1092 
13 1093    Dolphin. Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable.
13 1094 But though we thinke it so, it is no matter:
13 1095 In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh
13 1096 The Enemie more mightie then he seemes,
13 1097 So the proportions of defence are fill'd:
13 1098 Which of a weake and niggardly proiection,
13 1099 Doth like a Miser spoyle his Coat, with scanting
13 1100 A little Cloth
13 1101 
13 1102    King. Thinke we King Harry strong:
13 1103 And Princes, looke you strongly arme to meet him.
13 1104 The Kindred of him hath beene flesht vpon vs:
13 1105 And he is bred out of that bloodie straine,
13 1106 That haunted vs in our familiar Pathes:
13 1107 Witnesse our too much memorable shame,
13 1108 When Cressy Battell fatally was strucke,
13 1109 And all our Princes captiu'd, by the hand
13 1110 Of that black Name, Edward, black Prince of Wales:
13 1111 Whiles that his Mountaine Sire, on Mountaine standing
13 1112 Vp in the Ayre, crown'd with the Golden Sunne,
13 1113 Saw his Heroicall Seed, and smil'd to see him
13 1114 Mangle the Worke of Nature, and deface
13 1115 The Patternes, that by God and by French Fathers
13 1116 Had twentie yeeres been made. This is a Stem
13 1117 Of that Victorious Stock: and let vs feare
13 1118 The Natiue mightinesse and fate of him.
13 1119 Enter a Messenger.
13 1120 
13 1121   Mess. Embassadors from Harry King of England,
13 1122 Doe craue admittance to your Maiestie
13 1123 
13 1124    King. Weele giue them present audience.
13 1125 Goe, and bring them.
13 1126 You see this Chase is hotly followed, friends
13 1127 
13 1128    Dolphin. Turne head, and stop pursuit: for coward Dogs
13 1129 Most spend their mouths, whe[n] what they seem to threaten
13 1130 Runs farre before them. Good my Soueraigne
13 1131 Take vp the English short, and let them know
13 1132 Of what a Monarchie you are the Head:
13 1133 Selfe-loue, my Liege, is not so vile a sinne,
13 1134 As selfe-neglecting.
13 1135 Enter Exeter.
13 1136 
13 1137   King. From our Brother of England?
13 1138   Exe. From him, and thus he greets your Maiestie:
13 1139 He wills you in the Name of God Almightie,
13 1140 That you deuest your selfe, and lay apart
13 1141 The borrowed Glories, that by gift of Heauen,
13 1142 By Law of Nature, and of Nations, longs
13 1143 To him and to his Heires, namely, the Crowne,
13 1144 And all wide-stretched Honors, that pertaine
13 1145 By Custome, and the Ordinance of Times,
13 1146 Vnto the Crowne of France: that you may know
13 1147 'Tis no sinister, nor no awkward Clayme,
13 1148 Pickt from the worme-holes of long-vanisht dayes,
13 1149 Nor from the dust of old Obliuion rakt,
13 1150 He sends you this most memorable Lyne,
13 1151 In euery Branch truly demonstratiue;
13 1152 Willing you ouer-looke this Pedigree:
13 1153 And when you find him euenly deriu'd
13 1154 From his most fam'd, of famous Ancestors,
13 1155 Edward the third; he bids you then resigne
13 1156 Your Crowne and Kingdome, indirectly held
13 1157 From him, the Natiue and true Challenger
13 1158 
13 1159    King. Or else what followes?
13 1160   Exe. Bloody constraint: for if you hide the Crowne
13 1161 Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
13 1162 Therefore in fierce Tempest is he comming,
13 1163 In Thunder and in Earth-quake, like a Ioue:
13 1164 That if requiring faile, he will compell.
13 1165 And bids you, in the Bowels of the Lord,
13 1166 Deliuer vp the Crowne, and to take mercie
13 1167 On the poore Soules, for whom this hungry Warre
13 1168 Opens his vastie Iawes: and on your head
13 1169 Turning the Widdowes Teares, the Orphans Cryes,
13 1170 The dead-mens Blood, the priuy Maidens Groanes,
13 1171 For Husbands, Fathers, and betrothed Louers,
13 1172 That shall be swallowed in this Controuersie.
13 1173 This is his Clayme, his Threatning, and my Message:
13 1174 Vnlesse the Dolphin be in presence here;
13 1175 To whom expressely I bring greeting to
13 1176 
13 1177    King. For vs, we will consider of this further:
13 1178 To morrow shall you beare our full intent
13 1179 Back to our Brother of England
13 1180 
13 1181    Dolph. For the Dolphin,
13 1182 I stand here for him: what to him from England?
13 1183   Exe. Scorne and defiance, sleight regard, contempt,
13 1184 And any thing that may not mis-become
13 1185 The mightie Sender, doth he prize you at.
13 1186 Thus sayes my King: and if your Fathers Highnesse
13 1187 Doe not, in graunt of all demands at large,
13 1188 Sweeten the bitter Mock you sent his Maiestie;
13 1189 Hee'le call you to so hot an Answer of it,
13 1190 That Caues and Wombie Vaultages of France
13 1191 Shall chide your Trespas, and returne your Mock
13 1192 In second Accent of his Ordinance
13 1193 
13 1194    Dolph. Say: if my Father render faire returne,
13 1195 It is against my will: for I desire
13 1196 Nothing but Oddes with England.
13 1197 To that end, as matching to his Youth and Vanitie,
13 1198 I did present him with the Paris-Balls
13 1199 
13 1200    Exe. Hee'le make your Paris Louer shake for it,
13 1201 Were it the Mistresse Court of mightie Europe:
13 1202 And be assur'd, you'le find a diff'rence,
13 1203 As we his Subiects haue in wonder found,
13 1204 Betweene the promise of his greener dayes,
13 1205 And these he masters now: now he weighes Time
13 1206 Euen to the vtmost Graine: that you shall reade
13 1207 In your owne Losses, if he stay in France
13 1208 
13 1209    King. To morrow shall you know our mind at full.
13 1210 
13 1211 Flourish.
13 1212 
13 1213   Exe. Dispatch vs with all speed, least that our King
13 1214 Come here himselfe to question our delay;
13 1215 For he is footed in this Land already
13 1216 
13 1217    King. You shalbe soone dispatcht, with faire conditions.
13 1218 A Night is but small breathe, and little pawse,
13 1219 To answer matters of this consequence.
13 1220 
13 1221 Exeunt.
13 1222 
13 1223 
13 1224 Actus Secundus.
13 1225 
13 1226 Flourish. Enter Chorus.
13 1227 
13 1228 Thus with imagin'd wing our swift Scene flyes,
13 1229 In motion of no lesse celeritie then that of Thought.
13 1230 Suppose, that you haue seene
13 1231 The well-appointed King at Douer Peer,
13 1232 Embarke his Royaltie: and his braue Fleet,
13 1233 With silken Streamers, the young Phebus fayning;
13 1234 Play with your Fancies: and in them behold,
13 1235 Vpon the Hempen Tackle, Ship-boyes climbing;
13 1236 Heare the shrill Whistle, which doth order giue
13 1237 To sounds confus'd: behold the threaden Sayles,
13 1238 Borne with th' inuisible and creeping Wind,
13 1239 Draw the huge Bottomes through the furrowed Sea,
13 1240 Bresting the loftie Surge. O, doe but thinke
13 1241 You stand vpon the Riuage, and behold
13 1242 A Citie on th' inconstant Billowes dauncing:
13 1243 For so appeares this Fleet Maiesticall,
13 1244 Holding due course to Harflew. Follow, follow:
13 1245 Grapple your minds to sternage of this Nauie,
13 1246 And leaue your England as dead Mid-night, still,
13 1247 Guarded with Grandsires, Babyes, and old Women,
13 1248 Eyther past, or not arriu'd to pyth and puissance:
13 1249 For who is he, whose Chin is but enricht
13 1250 With one appearing Hayre, that will not follow
13 1251 These cull'd and choyse-drawne Caualiers to France?
13 1252 Worke, worke your Thoughts, and therein see a Siege:
13 1253 Behold the Ordenance on their Carriages,
13 1254 With fatall mouthes gaping on girded Harflew.
13 1255 Suppose th' Embassador from the French comes back:
13 1256 Tells Harry, That the King doth offer him
13 1257 Katherine his Daughter, and with her to Dowrie,
13 1258 Some petty and vnprofitable Dukedomes.
13 1259 The offer likes not: and the nimble Gunner
13 1260 With Lynstock now the diuellish Cannon touches,
13 1261 
13 1262 Alarum, and Chambers goe off.
13 1263 
13 1264 And downe goes all before them. Still be kind,
13 1265 And eech out our performance with your mind.
13 1266 Enter.
13 1267 
13 1268 Enter the King, Exeter, Bedford, and Gloucester. Alarum: Scaling
13 1269 Ladders
13 1270 at Harflew.
13 1271 
13 1272   King. Once more vnto the Breach,
13 1273 Deare friends, once more;
13 1274 Or close the Wall vp with our English dead:
13 1275 In Peace, there's nothing so becomes a man,
13 1276 As modest stillnesse, and humilitie:
13 1277 But when the blast of Warre blowes in our eares,
13 1278 Then imitate the action of the Tyger:
13 1279 Stiffen the sinewes, commune vp the blood,
13 1280 Disguise faire Nature with hard-fauour'd Rage:
13 1281 Then lend the Eye a terrible aspect:
13 1282 Let it pry through the portage of the Head,
13 1283 Like the Brasse Cannon: let the Brow o'rewhelme it,
13 1284 As fearefully, as doth a galled Rocke
13 1285 O're-hang and iutty his confounded Base,
13 1286 Swill'd with the wild and wastfull Ocean.
13 1287 Now set the Teeth, and stretch the Nosthrill wide,
13 1288 Hold hard the Breath, and bend vp euery Spirit
13 1289 To his full height. On, on, you Noblish English,
13 1290 Whose blood is fet from Fathers of Warre-proofe:
13 1291 Fathers, that like so many Alexanders,
13 1292 Haue in these parts from Morne till Euen fought,
13 1293 And sheath'd their Swords, for lack of argument.
13 1294 Dishonour not your Mothers: now attest,
13 1295 That those whom you call'd Fathers, did beget you.
13 1296 Be Coppy now to men of grosser blood,
13 1297 And teach them how to Warre. And you good Yeomen,
13 1298 Whose Lyms were made in England; shew vs here
13 1299 The mettell of your Pasture: let vs sweare,
13 1300 That you are worth your breeding: which I doubt not:
13 1301 For there is none of you so meane and base,
13 1302 That hath not Noble luster in your eyes.
13 1303 I see you stand like Grey-hounds in the slips,
13 1304 Straying vpon the Start. The Game's afoot:
13 1305 Follow your Spirit; and vpon this Charge,
13 1306 Cry, God for Harry, England, and S[aint]. George.
13 1307 
13 1308 Alarum, and Chambers goe off.
13 1309 
13 1310 Enter Nim, Bardolph, Pistoll, and Boy.
13 1311 
13 1312   Bard. On, on, on, on, on, to the breach, to the breach
13 1313 
13 1314    Nim. 'Pray thee Corporall stay, the Knocks are too
13 1315 hot: and for mine owne part, I haue not a Case of Liues:
13 1316 the humor of it is too hot, that is the very plaine-Song
13 1317 of it
13 1318 
13 1319    Pist. The plaine-Song is most iust: for humors doe abound:
13 1320 Knocks goe and come: Gods Vassals drop and
13 1321 dye: and Sword and Shield, in bloody Field, doth winne
13 1322 immortall fame
13 1323 
13 1324    Boy. Would I were in a Ale-house in London, I
13 1325 would giue all my fame for a Pot of Ale, and safetie
13 1326 
13 1327    Pist. And I: If wishes would preuayle with me, my
13 1328 purpose should not fayle with me; but thither would I
13 1329 high
13 1330 
13 1331    Boy. As duly, but not as truly, as Bird doth sing on
13 1332 bough.
13 1333 Enter Fluellen.
13 1334 
13 1335   Flu. Vp to the breach, you Dogges; auaunt you
13 1336 Cullions
13 1337 
13 1338    Pist. Be mercifull great Duke to men of Mould: abate
13 1339 thy Rage, abate thy manly Rage; abate thy Rage,
13 1340 great Duke. Good Bawcock bate thy Rage: vse lenitie
13 1341 sweet Chuck
13 1342 
13 1343    Nim. These be good humors: your Honor wins bad
13 1344 humors.
13 1345 Enter.
13 1346 
13 1347   Boy. As young as I am, I haue obseru'd these three
13 1348 Swashers: I am Boy to them all three, but all they three,
13 1349 though they would serue me, could not be Man to me;
13 1350 for indeed three such Antiques doe not amount to a man:
13 1351 for Bardolph, hee is white-liuer'd, and red-fac'd; by the
13 1352 meanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for Pistoll,
13 1353 hee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the
13 1354 meanes whereof, a breakes Words, and keepes whole
13 1355 Weapons: for Nim, hee hath heard, that men of few
13 1356 Words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say
13 1357 his Prayers, lest a should be thought a Coward: but his
13 1358 few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for
13 1359 a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was
13 1360 against a Post, when he was drunke. They will steale any
13 1361 thing, and call it Purchase. Bardolph stole a Lute-case,
13 1362 bore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.
13 1363 Nim and Bardolph are sworne Brothers in filching: and
13 1364 in Callice they stole a fire-shouell. I knew by that peece
13 1365 of Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would
13 1366 haue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues
13 1367 or their Hand-kerchers: which makes much against my
13 1368 Manhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put
13 1369 into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs.
13 1370 I must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their
13 1371 Villany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore
13 1372 I must cast it vp.
13 1373 Enter.
13 1374 
13 1375 Enter Gower.
13 1376 
13 1377   Gower. Captaine Fluellen, you must come presently to
13 1378 the Mynes; the Duke of Gloucester would speake with
13 1379 you
13 1380 
13 1381    Flu. To the Mynes? Tell you the Duke, it is not so
13 1382 good to come to the Mynes: for looke you, the Mynes
13 1383 is not according to the disciplines of the Warre; the concauities
13 1384 of it is not sufficient: for looke you, th' athuersarie,
13 1385 you may discusse vnto the Duke, looke you, is digt
13 1386 himselfe foure yard vnder the Countermines: by Cheshu,
13 1387 I thinke a will plowe vp all, if there is not better directions
13 1388 
13 1389    Gower. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the Order
13 1390 of the Siege is giuen, is altogether directed by an Irish
13 1391 man, a very valiant Gentleman yfaith
13 1392 
13 1393    Welch. It is Captaine Makmorrice, is it not?
13 1394   Gower. I thinke it be
13 1395 
13 1396    Welch. By Cheshu he is an Asse, as in the World, I will
13 1397 verifie as much in his Beard: he ha's no more directions
13 1398 in the true disciplines of the Warres, looke you, of the
13 1399 Roman disciplines, then is a Puppy-dog.
13 1400 Enter Makmorrice, and Captaine Iamy.
13 1401 
13 1402   Gower. Here a comes, and the Scots Captaine, Captaine
13 1403 Iamy, with him
13 1404 
13 1405    Welch. Captaine Iamy is a maruellous falorous Gentleman,
13 1406 that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge
13 1407 in th' aunchiant Warres, vpon my particular knowledge
13 1408 of his directions: by Cheshu he will maintaine his
13 1409 Argument as well as any Militarie man in the World, in
13 1410 the disciplines of the Pristine Warres of the Romans
13 1411 
13 1412    Scot. I say gudday, Captaine Fluellen
13 1413 
13 1414    Welch. Godden to your Worship, good Captaine
13 1415 Iames
13 1416 
13 1417    Gower. How now Captaine Mackmorrice, haue you
13 1418 quit the Mynes? haue the Pioners giuen o're?
13 1419   Irish. By Chrish Law tish ill done: the Worke ish
13 1420 giue ouer, the Trompet sound the Retreat. By my Hand
13 1421 I sweare, and my fathers Soule, the Worke ish ill done:
13 1422 it ish giue ouer: I would haue blowed vp the Towne,
13 1423 so Chrish saue me law, in an houre. O tish ill done, tish ill
13 1424 done: by my Hand tish ill done
13 1425 
13 1426    Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I beseech you now,
13 1427 will you voutsafe me, looke you, a few disputations with
13 1428 you, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
13 1429 the Warre, the Roman Warres, in the way of Argument,
13 1430 looke you, and friendly communication: partly to satisfie
13 1431 my Opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, looke you, of
13 1432 my Mind: as touching the direction of the Militarie discipline,
13 1433 that is the Point
13 1434 
13 1435    Scot. It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud Captens bath,
13 1436 and I sall quit you with gud leue, as I may pick occasion:
13 1437 that sall I mary
13 1438 
13 1439    Irish. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish saue me:
13 1440 the day is hot, and the Weather, and the Warres, and the
13 1441 King, and the Dukes: it is no time to discourse, the Town
13 1442 is beseech'd: and the Trumpet call vs to the breech, and
13 1443 we talke, and be Chrish do nothing, tis shame for vs all:
13 1444 so God sa'me tis shame to stand still, it is shame by my
13 1445 hand: and there is Throats to be cut, and Workes to be
13 1446 done, and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa'me law
13 1447 
13 1448    Scot. By the Mes, ere theise eyes of mine take themselues
13 1449 to slomber, ayle de gud seruice, or Ile ligge i'th'
13 1450 grund for it; ay, or goe to death: and Ile pay't as valorously
13 1451 as I may, that sal I suerly do, that is the breff and
13 1452 the long: mary, I wad full faine heard some question
13 1453 tween you tway
13 1454 
13 1455    Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, I thinke, looke you,
13 1456 vnder your correction, there is not many of your Nation
13 1457 
13 1458    Irish. Of my Nation? What ish my Nation? Ish a
13 1459 Villaine, and a Basterd, and a Knaue, and a Rascall. What
13 1460 ish my Nation? Who talkes of my Nation?
13 1461   Welch. Looke you, if you take the matter otherwise
13 1462 then is meant, Captaine Mackmorrice, peraduenture I
13 1463 shall thinke you doe not vse me with that affabilitie, as in
13 1464 discretion you ought to vse me, looke you, being as good
13 1465 a man as your selfe, both in the disciplines of Warre, and
13 1466 in the deriuation of my Birth, and in other particularities
13 1467 
13 1468    Irish. I doe not know you so good a man as my selfe:
13 1469 so Chrish saue me, I will cut off your Head
13 1470 
13 1471    Gower. Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other
13 1472 
13 1473    Scot. A, that's a foule fault.
13 1474 
13 1475 A Parley.
13 1476 
13 1477   Gower. The Towne sounds a Parley
13 1478 
13 1479    Welch. Captaine Mackmorrice, when there is more
13 1480 better oportunitie to be required, looke you, I will be
13 1481 so bold as to tell you, I know the disciplines of Warre:
13 1482 and there is an end.
13 1483 Enter.
13 1484 
13 1485 Enter the King and all his Traine before the Gates.
13 1486 
13 1487   King. How yet resolues the Gouernour of the Towne?
13 1488 This is the latest Parle we will admit:
13 1489 Therefore to our best mercy giue your selues,
13 1490 Or like to men prowd of destruction,
13 1491 Defie vs to our worst: for as I am a Souldier,
13 1492 A Name that in my thoughts becomes me best;
13 1493 If I begin the batt'rie once againe,
13 1494 I will not leaue the halfe-atchieued Harflew,
13 1495 Till in her ashes she lye buryed.
13 1496 The Gates of Mercy shall be all shut vp,
13 1497 And the flesh'd Souldier, rough and hard of heart,
13 1498 In libertie of bloody hand, shall raunge
13 1499 With Conscience wide as Hell, mowing like Grasse
13 1500 Your fresh faire Virgins, and your flowring Infants.
13 1501 What is it then to me, if impious Warre,
13 1502 Arrayed in flames like to the Prince of Fiends,
13 1503 Doe with his smyrcht complexion all fell feats,
13 1504 Enlynckt to wast and desolation?
13 1505 What is't to me, when you your selues are cause,
13 1506 If your pure Maydens fall into the hand
13 1507 Of hot and forcing Violation?
13 1508 What Reyne can hold licentious Wickednesse,
13 1509 When downe the Hill he holds his fierce Carriere?
13 1510 We may as bootlesse spend our vaine Command
13 1511 Vpon th' enraged Souldiers in their spoyle,
13 1512 As send Precepts to the Leuiathan, to come ashore.
13 1513 Therefore, you men of Harflew,
13 1514 Take pitty of your Towne and of your People,
13 1515 Whiles yet my Souldiers are in my Command,
13 1516 Whiles yet the coole and temperate Wind of Grace
13 1517 O're-blowes the filthy and contagious Clouds
13 1518 Of heady Murther, Spoyle, and Villany.
13 1519 If not: why in a moment looke to see
13 1520 The blind and bloody Souldier, with foule hand
13 1521 Desire the Locks of your shrill-shriking Daughters:
13 1522 Your Fathers taken by the siluer Beards,
13 1523 And their most reuerend Heads dasht to the Walls:
13 1524 Your naked Infants spitted vpon Pykes,
13 1525 Whiles the mad Mothers, with their howles confus'd,
13 1526 Doe breake the Clouds; as did the Wiues of Iewry,
13 1527 At Herods bloody-hunting slaughter-men.
13 1528 What say you? Will you yeeld, and this auoyd?
13 1529 Or guiltie in defence, be thus destroy'd.
13 1530 Enter Gouernour.
13 1531 
13 1532   Gouer. Our expectation hath this day an end:
13 1533 The Dolphin, whom of Succours we entreated,
13 1534 Returnes vs, that his Powers are yet not ready,
13 1535 To rayse so great a Siege: Therefore great King,
13 1536 We yeeld our Towne and Liues to thy soft Mercy:
13 1537 Enter our Gates, dispose of vs and ours,
13 1538 For we no longer are defensible
13 1539 
13 1540    King. Open your Gates: Come Vnckle Exeter,
13 1541 Goe you and enter Harflew; there remaine,
13 1542 And fortifie it strongly 'gainst the French:
13 1543 Vse mercy to them all for vs, deare Vnckle.
13 1544 The Winter comming on, and Sicknesse growing
13 1545 Vpon our Souldiers, we will retyre to Calis.
13 1546 To night in Harflew will we be your Guest,
13 1547 To morrow for the March are we addrest.
13 1548 
13 1549 Flourish, and enter the Towne.
13 1550 
13 1551 Enter Katherine and an old Gentlewoman.

13 1653 And giue our Vineyards to a barbarous People
13 1654 
13 1655    Dolph. O Dieu viuant: Shall a few Sprayes of vs,
13 1656 The emptying of our Fathers Luxurie,
13 1657 Our Syens, put in wilde and sauage Stock,
13 1658 Spirt vp so suddenly into the Clouds,
13 1659 And ouer-looke their Grafters?
13 1660   Brit. Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards:
13 1661 Mort du ma vie, if they march along
13 1662 Vnfought withall, but I will sell my Dukedome,
13 1663 To buy a slobbry and a durtie Farme
13 1664 In that nooke-shotten Ile of Albion
13 1665 
13 1666    Const. Dieu de Battailes, where haue they this mettell?
13 1667 Is not their Clymate foggy, raw, and dull?
13 1668 On whom, as in despight, the Sunne lookes pale,
13 1669 Killing their Fruit with frownes. Can sodden Water,
13 1670 A Drench for sur-reyn'd Iades, their Barly broth,
13 1671 Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
13 1672 And shall our quick blood, spirited with Wine,
13 1673 Seeme frostie? O, for honor of our Land,
13 1674 Let vs not hang like roping Isyckles
13 1675 Vpon our Houses Thatch, whiles a more frostie People
13 1676 Sweat drops of gallant Youth in our rich fields:
13 1677 Poore we call them, in their Natiue Lords
13 1678 
13 1679    Dolphin. By Faith and Honor,
13 1680 Our Madames mock at vs, and plainely say,
13 1681 Our Mettell is bred out, and they will giue
13 1682 Their bodyes to the Lust of English Youth,
13 1683 To new-store France with Bastard Warriors
13 1684 
13 1685    Brit. They bid vs to the English Dancing-Schooles,
13 1686 And teach Lauolta's high, and swift Carranto's,
13 1687 Saying, our Grace is onely in our Heeles,
13 1688 And that we are most loftie Run-awayes
13 1689 
13 1690    King. Where is Montioy the Herald? speed him hence,
13 1691 Let him greet England with our sharpe defiance.
13 1692 Vp Princes, and with spirit of Honor edged,
13 1693 More sharper then your Swords, high to the field:
13 1694 Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France,
13 1695 You Dukes of Orleance, Burbon, and of Berry,
13 1696 Alanson, Brabant, Bar, and Burgonie,
13 1697 Iaques Chattillion, Rambures, Vandemont,
13 1698 Beumont, Grand Pree, Roussi, and Faulconbridge,
13 1699 Loys, Lestrale, Bouciquall, and Charaloyes,
13 1700 High Dukes, great Princes, Barons, Lords, and Kings;
13 1701 For your great Seats, now quit you of great shames:
13 1702 Barre Harry England, that sweepes through our Land
13 1703 With Penons painted in the blood of Harflew:
13 1704 Rush on his Hoast, as doth the melted Snow
13 1705 Vpon the Valleyes, whose low Vassall Seat,
13 1706 The Alpes doth spit, and void his rhewme vpon.
13 1707 Goe downe vpon him, you haue Power enough,
13 1708 And in a Captiue Chariot, into Roan
13 1709 Bring him our Prisoner
13 1710 
13 1711    Const. This becomes the Great.
13 1712 Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
13 1713 His Souldiers sick, and famisht in their March:
13 1714 For I am sure, when he shall see our Army,
13 1715 Hee'le drop his heart into the sinck of feare,
13 1716 And for atchieuement, offer vs his Ransome
13 1717 
13 1718    King. Therefore Lord Constable, hast on Montioy,
13 1719 And let him say to England, that we send,
13 1720 To know what willing Ransome he will giue.
13 1721 Prince Dolphin, you shall stay with vs in Roan
13 1722 
13 1723    Dolph. Not so, I doe beseech your Maiestie
13 1724 
13 1725    King. Be patient, for you shall remaine with vs.
13 1726 Now forth Lord Constable, and Princes all,
13 1727 And quickly bring vs word of Englands fall.
13 1728 
13 1729 Exeunt.
13 1730 
13 1731 Enter Captaines, English and Welch, Gower and Fluellen.
13 1732 
13 1733   Gower. How now Captaine Fluellen, come you from
13 1734 the Bridge?
13 1735   Flu. I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices committed
13 1736 at the Bridge
13 1737 
13 1738    Gower. Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
13 1739   Flu. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,
13 1740 and a man that I loue and honour with my soule,
13 1741 and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing,
13 1742 and my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and
13 1743 blessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge
13 1744 most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient
13 1745 Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very
13 1746 conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and
13 1747 hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see
13 1748 him doe as gallant seruice
13 1749 
13 1750    Gower. What doe you call him?
13 1751   Flu. Hee is call'd aunchient Pistoll
13 1752 
13 1753    Gower. I know him not.
13 1754 Enter Pistoll.
13 1755 
13 1756   Flu. Here is the man
13 1757 
13 1758    Pist. Captaine, I thee beseech to doe me fauours: the
13 1759 Duke of Exeter doth loue thee well
13 1760 
13 1761    Flu. I, I prayse God, and I haue merited some loue at
13 1762 his hands
13 1763 
13 1764    Pist. Bardolph, a Souldier firme and sound of heart,
13 1765 and of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie
13 1766 Fortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Goddesse blind, that
13 1767 stands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone
13 1768 
13 1769    Flu. By your patience, aunchient Pistoll: Fortune is
13 1770 painted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to signifie
13 1771 to you, that Fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also
13 1772 with a Wheele, to signifie to you, which is the Morall of
13 1773 it, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie,
13 1774 and variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a
13 1775 Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles:
13 1776 in good truth, the Poet makes a most excellent description
13 1777 of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall
13 1778 
13 1779    Pist. Fortune is Bardolphs foe, and frownes on him:
13 1780 for he hath stolne a Pax, and hanged must a be: a damned
13 1781 death: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free,
13 1782 and let not Hempe his Wind-pipe suffocate: but Exeter
13 1783 hath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price.
13 1784 Therefore goe speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce;
13 1785 and let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of
13 1786 Penny-Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for
13 1787 his Life, and I will thee requite
13 1788 
13 1789    Flu. Aunchient Pistoll, I doe partly vnderstand your
13 1790 meaning
13 1791 
13 1792    Pist. Why then reioyce therefore
13 1793 
13 1794    Flu. Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce
13 1795 at: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire
13 1796 the Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execution;
13 1797 for discipline ought to be vsed
13 1798 
13 1799    Pist. Dye, and be dam'd, and Figo for thy friendship
13 1800 
13 1801    Flu. It is well
13 1802 
13 1803    Pist. The Figge of Spaine.
13 1804 Enter.
13 1805 
13 1806   Flu. Very good
13 1807 
13 1808    Gower. Why, this is an arrant counterfeit Rascall, I
13 1809 remember him now: a Bawd, a Cut-purse
13 1810 
13 1811    Flu. Ile assure you, a vtt'red as praue words at the
13 1812 Pridge, as you shall see in a Summers day: but it is very
13 1813 well: what he ha's spoke to me, that is well I warrant you,
13 1814 when time is serue
13 1815 
13 1816    Gower. Why 'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and
13 1817 then goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne
13 1818 into London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and such
13 1819 fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and
13 1820 they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done;
13 1821 at such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Conuoy:
13 1822 who came off brauely, who was shot, who disgrac'd,
13 1823 what termes the Enemy stood on: and this they
13 1824 conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke
13 1825 vp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Generalls
13 1826 Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe among
13 1827 foming Bottles, and Ale-washt Wits, is wonderfull
13 1828 to be thought on: but you must learne to know such
13 1829 slanders of the age, or else you may be maruellously mistooke
13 1830 
13 1831    Flu. I tell you what, Captaine Gower: I doe perceiue
13 1832 hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to
13 1833 the World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell
13 1834 him my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I
13 1835 must speake with him from the Pridge.
13 1836 
13 1837 Drum and Colours. Enter the King and his poore Souldiers.
13 1838 
13 1839   Flu. God plesse your Maiestie
13 1840 
13 1841    King. How now Fluellen, cam'st thou from the Bridge?
13 1842   Flu. I, so please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter
13 1843 ha's very gallantly maintain'd the Pridge; the French is
13 1844 gone off, looke you, and there is gallant and most praue
13 1845 passages: marry, th' athuersarie was haue possession of
13 1846 the Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of
13 1847 Exeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie,
13 1848 the Duke is a praue man
13 1849 
13 1850    King. What men haue you lost, Fluellen?
13 1851   Flu. The perdition of th' athuersarie hath beene very
13 1852 great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the
13 1853 Duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be executed
13 1854 for robbing a Church, one Bardolph, if your Maiestie
13 1855 know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes,
13 1856 and knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his
13 1857 nose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and
13 1858 sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's
13 1859 out
13 1860 
13 1861    King. Wee would haue all such offendors so cut off:
13 1862 and we giue expresse charge, that in our Marches through
13 1863 the Countrey, there be nothing compell'd from the Villages;
13 1864 nothing taken, but pay'd for: none of the French
13 1865 vpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when
13 1866 Leuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler
13 1867 Gamester is the soonest winner.
13 1868 
13 1869 Tucket. Enter Mountioy.
13 1870 
13 1871   Mountioy. You know me by my habit
13 1872 
13 1873    King. Well then, I know thee: what shall I know of
13 1874 thee?
13 1875   Mountioy. My Masters mind
13 1876 
13 1877    King. Vnfold it
13 1878 
13 1879    Mountioy. Thus sayes my King: Say thou to Harry
13 1880 of England, Though we seem'd dead, we did but sleepe:
13 1881 Aduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse. Tell him,
13 1882 wee could haue rebuk'd him at Harflewe, but that wee
13 1883 thought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full
13 1884 ripe. Now wee speake vpon our Q. and our voyce is imperiall:
13 1885 England shall repent his folly, see his weakenesse,
13 1886 and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider
13 1887 of his ransome, which must proportion the losses we
13 1888 haue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we
13 1889 haue digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettinesse
13 1890 would bow vnder. For our losses, his Exchequer is
13 1891 too poore; for th' effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his
13 1892 Kingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his
13 1893 owne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worthlesse
13 1894 satisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for
13 1895 conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation
13 1896 is pronounc't: So farre my King and Master;
13 1897 so much my Office
13 1898 
13 1899    King. What is thy name? I know thy qualitie
13 1900 
13 1901    Mount. Mountioy
13 1902 
13 1903    King. Thou doo'st thy Office fairely. Turne thee backe,
13 1904 And tell thy King, I doe not seeke him now,
13 1905 But could be willing to march on to Callice,
13 1906 Without impeachment: for to say the sooth,
13 1907 Though 'tis no wisdome to confesse so much
13 1908 Vnto an enemie of Craft and Vantage,
13 1909 My people are with sicknesse much enfeebled,
13 1910 My numbers lessen'd: and those few I haue,
13 1911 Almost no better then so many French;
13 1912 Who when they were in health, I tell thee Herald,
13 1913 I thought, vpon one payre of English Legges
13 1914 Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgiue me God,
13 1915 That I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France
13 1916 Hath blowne that vice in me. I must repent:
13 1917 Goe therefore tell thy Master, heere I am;
13 1918 My Ransome, is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke;
13 1919 My Army, but a weake and sickly Guard:
13 1920 Yet God before, tell him we will come on,
13 1921 Though France himselfe, and such another Neighbor
13 1922 Stand in our way. There's for thy labour Mountioy.
13 1923 Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe.
13 1924 If we may passe, we will: if we be hindred,
13 1925 We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood
13 1926 Discolour: and so Mountioy, fare you well.
13 1927 The summe of all our Answer is but this:
13 1928 We would not seeke a Battaile as we are,
13 1929 Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it:
13 1930 So tell your Master
13 1931 
13 1932    Mount. I shall deliuer so: Thankes to your Highnesse
13 1933 
13 1934    Glouc. I hope they will not come vpon vs now
13 1935 
13 1936    King. We are in Gods hand, Brother, not in theirs:
13 1937 March to the Bridge, it now drawes toward night,
13 1938 Beyond the Riuer wee'le encampe our selues,
13 1939 And on to morrow bid them march away.
13 1940 
13 1941 Exeunt.
13 1942 
13 1943 Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Ramburs, Orleance,
13 1944 Dolphin, with
13 1945 others.
13 1946 
13 1947   Const. Tut, I haue the best Armour of the World:
13 1948 would it were day
13 1949 
13 1950    Orleance. You haue an excellent Armour: but let my
13 1951 Horse haue his due
13 1952 
13 1953    Const. It is the best Horse of Europe
13 1954 
13 1955    Orleance. Will it neuer be Morning?
13 1956   Dolph. My Lord of Orleance, and my Lord High Constable,
13 1957 you talke of Horse and Armour?
13 1958   Orleance. You are as well prouided of both, as any
13 1959 Prince in the World
13 1960 
13 1961    Dolph. What a long Night is this? I will not change
13 1962 my Horse with any that treades but on foure postures:
13 1963 ch' ha: he bounds from the Earth, as if his entrayles were
13 1964 hayres: le Cheual volante, the Pegasus, ches les narines de
13 1965 feu. When I bestryde him, I soare, I am a Hawke: he trots
13 1966 the ayre: the Earth sings, when he touches it: the basest
13 1967 horne of his hoofe, is more Musicall then the Pipe of
13 1968 Hermes
13 1969 
13 1970    Orleance. Hee's of the colour of the Nutmeg
13 1971 
13 1972    Dolph. And of the heat of the Ginger. It is a Beast
13 1973 for Perseus: hee is pure Ayre and Fire; and the dull Elements
13 1974 of Earth and Water neuer appeare in him, but only
13 1975 in patient stillnesse while his Rider mounts him: hee
13 1976 is indeede a Horse, and all other Iades you may call
13 1977 Beasts
13 1978 
13 1979    Const. Indeed my Lord, it is a most absolute and excellent
13 1980 Horse
13 1981 
13 1982    Dolph. It is the Prince of Palfrayes, his Neigh is like
13 1983 the bidding of a Monarch, and his countenance enforces
13 1984 Homage
13 1985 
13 1986    Orleance. No more Cousin
13 1987 
13 1988    Dolph. Nay, the man hath no wit, that cannot from
13 1989 the rising of the Larke to the lodging of the Lambe,
13 1990 varie deserued prayse on my Palfray: it is a Theame as
13 1991 fluent as the Sea: Turne the Sands into eloquent tongues,
13 1992 and my Horse is argument for them all: 'tis a subiect
13 1993 for a Soueraigne to reason on, and for a Soueraignes Soueraigne
13 1994 to ride on: And for the World, familiar to vs,
13 1995 and vnknowne, to lay apart their particular Functions,
13 1996 and wonder at him, I once writ a Sonnet in his prayse,
13 1997 and began thus, Wonder of Nature
13 1998 
13 1999    Orleance. I haue heard a Sonnet begin so to ones Mistresse
13 2000 
13 2001    Dolph. Then did they imitate that which I compos'd
13 2002 to my Courser, for my Horse is my Mistresse
13 2003 
13 2004    Orleance. Your Mistresse beares well
13 2005 
13 2006    Dolph. Me well, which is the prescript prayse and perfection
13 2007 of a good and particular Mistresse
13 2008 
13 2009    Const. Nay, for me thought yesterday your Mistresse
13 2010 shrewdly shooke your back
13 2011 
13 2012    Dolph. So perhaps did yours
13 2013 
13 2014    Const. Mine was not bridled
13 2015 
13 2016    Dolph. O then belike she was old and gentle, and you
13 2017 rode like a Kerne of Ireland, your French Hose off, and in
13 2018 your strait Strossers
13 2019 
13 2020    Const. You haue good iudgement in Horsemanship
13 2021 
13 2022    Dolph. Be warn'd by me then: they that ride so, and
13 2023 ride not warily, fall into foule Boggs: I had rather haue
13 2024 my Horse to my Mistresse
13 2025 
13 2026    Const. I had as liue haue my Mistresse a Iade
13 2027 
13 2028    Dolph. I tell thee Constable, my Mistresse weares his
13 2029 owne hayre
13 2030 
13 2031    Const. I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a
13 2032 Sow to my Mistresse
13 2033 
13 2034    Dolph. Le chien est retourne a son propre vemissement est
13 2035 la leuye lauee au bourbier: thou mak'st vse of any thing
13 2036 
13 2037    Const. Yet doe I not vse my Horse for my Mistresse,
13 2038 or any such Prouerbe, so little kin to the purpose
13 2039 
13 2040    Ramb. My Lord Constable, the Armour that I saw in
13 2041 your Tent to night, are those Starres or Sunnes vpon it?

13 2045 
13 2046    Const. And yet my Sky shall not want
13 2047

13 2049 and 'twere more honor some were away
13 2050 
13 2051    Const. Eu'n as your Horse beares your prayses, who
13 2052 would trot as well, were some of your bragges dismounted
13 2053 
13 2054    Dolph. Would I were able to loade him with his desert.
13 2055 Will it neuer be day? I will trot to morrow a mile,
13 2056 and my way shall be paued with English Faces
13 2057 
13 2058    Const. I will not say so, for feare I should be fac't out
13 2059 of my way: but I would it were morning, for I would
13 2060 faine be about the eares of the English
13 2061

13 2063 Prisoners?

13 2071

13 2087    Orleance. He neuer did harme, that I heard of
13 2088 
13 2089    Const. Nor will doe none to morrow: hee will keepe
13 2090 that good name still
13 2091 
13 2092    Orleance. I know him to be valiant
13 2093

13 2095 then you

13 2098   Const. Marry hee told me so himselfe, and hee sayd hee
13 2099 car'd not who knew it
13 2100

13 2102 him
13 2103 
13 2104    Const. By my faith Sir, but it is: neuer any body saw
13 2105 it, but his Lacquey: 'tis a hooded valour, and when it
13 2106 appeares, it will bate
13 2107

13 2126 Enter a Messenger.

13 2129 fifteene hundred paces of your Tents

13 2134    Const. A valiant and most expert Gentleman. Would

13 2138    Orleance. What a wretched and peeuish fellow is this
13 2139 King of England, to mope with his fat-brain'd followers
13 2140 so farre out of his knowledge

13 2150 Creatures; their Mastiffes are of vnmatchable courage
13 2151

13 2153 the mouth of a Russian Beare, and haue their heads crusht
13 2154 like rotten Apples: you may as well say, that's a valiant
13 2155 Flea, that dare eate his breakefast on the Lippe of a
13 2156 Lyon
13 2157 
13 2158    Const. Iust, iust: and the men doe sympathize with
13 2159 the Mastiffes, in robustious and rough comming on,
13 2160 leauing their Wits with their Wiues: and then giue
13 2161 them great Meales of Beefe, and Iron and Steele; they
13 2162 will eate like Wolues, and fight like Deuils

13 2167    Const. Then shall we finde to morrow, they haue only
13 2168 stomackes to eate, and none to fight. Now is it time to
13 2169 arme: come, shall we about it?
13 2170   Orleance. It is now two a Clock: but let me see, by ten
13 2171 Wee shall haue each a hundred English men.

13 2176 Actus Tertius.
13 2177 
13 2178 Chorus.
13 2179 
13 2180 Now entertaine coniecture of a time,
13 2181 When creeping Murmure and the poring Darke
13 2182 Fills the wide Vessell of the Vniuerse.
13 2183 From Camp to Camp, through the foule Womb of Night
13 2184 The Humme of eyther Army stilly sounds;
13 2185 That the fixt Centinels almost receiue
13 2186 The secret Whispers of each others Watch.
13 2187 Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
13 2188 Each Battaile sees the others vmber'd face.
13 2189 Steed threatens Steed, in high and boastfull Neighs
13 2190 Piercing the Nights dull Eare: and from the Tents,
13 2191 The Armourers accomplishing the Knights,
13 2192 With busie Hammers closing Riuets vp,
13 2193 Giue dreadfull note of preparation.
13 2194 The Countrey Cocks doe crow, the Clocks doe towle:
13 2195 And the third howre of drowsie Morning nam'd,
13 2196 Prowd of their Numbers, and secure in Soule,
13 2197 The confident and ouer-lustie French,
13 2198 Doe the low-rated English play at Dice;
13 2199 And chide the creeple-tardy-gated Night,
13 2200 Who like a foule and ougly Witch doth limpe
13 2201 So tediously away. The poore condemned English,
13 2202 Like Sacrifices, by their watchfull Fires
13 2203 Sit patiently, and inly ruminate
13 2204 The Mornings danger: and their gesture sad,
13 2205 Inuesting lanke-leane Cheekes, and Warre-worne Coats,
13 2206 Presented them vnto the gazing Moone
13 2207 So many horride Ghosts. O now, who will behold
13 2208 The Royall Captaine of this ruin'd Band
13 2209 Walking from Watch to Watch, from Tent to Tent;
13 2210 Let him cry, Prayse and Glory on his head:
13 2211 For forth he goes, and visits all his Hoast,
13 2212 Bids them good morrow with a modest Smyle,
13 2213 And calls them Brothers, Friends, and Countreymen.
13 2214 Vpon his Royall Face there is no note,
13 2215 How dread an Army hath enrounded him;
13 2216 Nor doth he dedicate one iot of Colour
13 2217 Vnto the wearie and all-watched Night:
13 2218 But freshly lookes, and ouer-beares Attaint,
13 2219 With chearefull semblance, and sweet Maiestie:
13 2220 That euery Wretch, pining and pale before,
13 2221 Beholding him, plucks comfort from his Lookes.
13 2222 A Largesse vniuersall, like the Sunne,
13 2223 His liberall Eye doth giue to euery one,
13 2224 Thawing cold feare, that meane and gentle all
13 2225 Behold, as may vnworthinesse define.
13 2226 A little touch of Harry in the Night,
13 2227 And so our Scene must to the Battaile flye:
13 2228 Where, O for pitty, we shall much disgrace,
13 2229 With foure or fiue most vile and ragged foyles,
13 2230 (Right ill dispos'd, in brawle ridiculous)
13 2231 The Name of Agincourt: Yet sit and see,
13 2232 Minding true things, by what their Mock'ries bee.
13 2233 Enter.
13 2234 
13 2235 Enter the King, Bedford, and Gloucester.
13 2236 
13 2237   King. Gloster, 'tis true that we are in great danger,
13 2238 The greater therefore should our Courage be.
13 2239 God morrow Brother Bedford: God Almightie,
13 2240 There is some soule of goodnesse in things euill,
13 2241 Would men obseruingly distill it out.
13 2242 For our bad Neighbour makes vs early stirrers,
13 2243 Which is both healthfull, and good husbandry.
13 2244 Besides, they are our outward Consciences,
13 2245 And Preachers to vs all; admonishing,
13 2246 That we should dresse vs fairely for our end.
13 2247 Thus may we gather Honey from the Weed,
13 2248 And make a Morall of the Diuell himselfe.
13 2249 Enter Erpingham.
13 2250 
13 2251 Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
13 2252 A good soft Pillow for that good white Head,
13 2253 Were better then a churlish turfe of France
13 2254 
13 2255    Erping. Not so my Liege, this Lodging likes me better,
13 2256 Since I may say, now lye I like a King
13 2257 
13 2258    King. 'Tis good for men to loue their present paines,
13 2259 Vpon example, so the Spirit is eased:
13 2260 And when the Mind is quickned, out of doubt
13 2261 The Organs, though defunct and dead before,
13 2262 Breake vp their drowsie Graue, and newly moue
13 2263 With casted slough, and fresh legeritie.
13 2264 Lend me thy Cloake Sir Thomas: Brothers both,
13 2265 Commend me to the Princes in our Campe;
13 2266 Doe my good morrow to them, and anon
13 2267 Desire them all to my Pauillion
13 2268 
13 2269    Gloster. We shall, my Liege
13 2270 
13 2271    Erping. Shall I attend your Grace?
13 2272   King. No, my good Knight:
13 2273 Goe with my Brothers to my Lords of England:
13 2274 I and my Bosome must debate a while,
13 2275 And then I would no other company
13 2276 
13 2277    Erping. The Lord in Heauen blesse thee, Noble
13 2278 Harry.
13 2279 
13 2280 Exeunt.
13 2281 
13 2282   King. God a mercy old Heart, thou speak'st chearefully.
13 2283 Enter Pistoll
13 2284 
13 2285    Pist. Che vous la?
13 2286   King. A friend
13 2287 
13 2288    Pist. Discusse vnto me, art thou Officer, or art thou
13 2289 base, common, and popular?
13 2290   King. I am a Gentleman of a Company
13 2291 
13 2292    Pist. Trayl'st thou the puissant Pyke?
13 2293   King. Euen so: what are you?
13 2294   Pist. As good a Gentleman as the Emperor
13 2295 
13 2296    King. Then you are a better then the King
13 2297 
13 2298    Pist. The King's a Bawcock, and a Heart of Gold, a
13 2299 Lad of Life, an Impe of Fame, of Parents good, of Fist
13 2300 most valiant: I kisse his durtie shooe, and from heartstring
13 2301 I loue the louely Bully. What is thy Name?
13 2302   King. Harry le Roy
13 2303 
13 2304    Pist. Le Roy? a Cornish Name: art thou of Cornish Crew?
13 2305   King. No, I am a Welchman
13 2306 
13 2307    Pist. Know'st thou Fluellen?
13 2308   King. Yes
13 2309 
13 2310    Pist. Tell him Ile knock his Leeke about his Pate vpon
13 2311 S[aint]. Dauies day
13 2312 
13 2313    King. Doe not you weare your Dagger in your Cappe
13 2314 that day, least he knock that about yours
13 2315 
13 2316    Pist. Art thou his friend?
13 2317   King. And his Kinsman too
13 2318 
13 2319    Pist. The Figo for thee then
13 2320 
13 2321    King. I thanke you: God be with you
13 2322 
13 2323    Pist. My name is Pistol call'd.
13 2324 Enter.
13 2325 
13 2326   King. It sorts well with your fiercenesse.
13 2327 
13 2328 Manet King.
13 2329 
13 2330 Enter Fluellen and Gower.
13 2331 
13 2332   Gower. Captaine Fluellen
13 2333 
13 2334    Flu. 'So, in the Name of Iesu Christ, speake fewer: it
13 2335 is the greatest admiration in the vniuersall World, when
13 2336 the true and aunchient Prerogatifes and Lawes of the
13 2337 Warres is not kept: if you would take the paines but to
13 2338 examine the Warres of Pompey the Great, you shall finde,
13 2339 I warrant you, that there is no tiddle tadle nor pibble bable
13 2340 in Pompeyes Campe: I warrant you, you shall finde
13 2341 the Ceremonies of the Warres, and the Cares of it, and
13 2342 the Formes of it, and the Sobrietie of it, and the Modestie
13 2343 of it, to be otherwise
13 2344 
13 2345    Gower. Why the Enemie is lowd, you heare him all
13 2346 Night
13 2347 
13 2348    Flu. If the Enemie is an Asse and a Foole, and a prating
13 2349 Coxcombe; is it meet, thinke you, that wee should
13 2350 also, looke you, be an Asse and a Foole, and a prating Coxcombe,
13 2351 in your owne conscience now?
13 2352   Gow. I will speake lower
13 2353 
13 2354    Flu. I pray you, and beseech you, that you will.
13 2355 Enter.
13 2356 
13 2357   King. Though it appeare a little out of fashion,
13 2358 There is much care and valour in this Welchman.
13 2359 Enter three Souldiers, Iohn Bates, Alexander Court, and Michael
13 2360 Williams.
13 2361 
13 2362 
13 2363   Court. Brother Iohn Bates, is not that the Morning
13 2364 which breakes yonder?
13 2365   Bates. I thinke it be: but wee haue no great cause to
13 2366 desire the approach of day
13 2367 
13 2368    Williams. Wee see yonder the beginning of the day,
13 2369 but I thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it. Who goes
13 2370 there?
13 2371   King. A Friend
13 2372 
13 2373    Williams. Vnder what Captaine serue you?
13 2374   King. Vnder Sir Iohn Erpingham
13 2375 
13 2376    Williams. A good old Commander, and a most kinde
13 2377 Gentleman: I pray you, what thinkes he of our estate?
13 2378   King. Euen as men wrackt vpon a Sand, that looke to
13 2379 be washt off the next Tyde
13 2380 
13 2381    Bates. He hath not told his thought to the King?
13 2382   King. No: nor it is not meet he should: for though I
13 2383 speake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am:
13 2384 the Violet smells to him, as it doth to me; the Element
13 2385 shewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but
13 2386 humane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Nakednesse
13 2387 he appeares but a man; and though his affections
13 2388 are higher mounted then ours, yet when they stoupe,
13 2389 they stoupe with the like wing: therefore, when he sees
13 2390 reason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of
13 2391 the same rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man should
13 2392 possesse him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by
13 2393 shewing it, should dis-hearten his Army
13 2394 
13 2395    Bates. He may shew what outward courage he will:
13 2396 but I beleeue, as cold a Night as 'tis, hee could wish himselfe
13 2397 in Thames vp to the Neck; and so I would he were,
13 2398 and I by him, at all aduentures, so we were quit here
13 2399 
13 2400    King. By my troth, I will speake my conscience of the
13 2401 King: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where,
13 2402 but where hee is
13 2403 
13 2404    Bates. Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
13 2405 sure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues saued
13 2406 
13 2407    King. I dare say, you loue him not so ill, to wish him
13 2408 here alone: howsoeuer you speake this to feele other
13 2409 mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where so contented,
13 2410 as in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and
13 2411 his Quarrell honorable
13 2412 
13 2413    Williams. That's more then we know
13 2414 
13 2415    Bates. I, or more then wee should seeke after; for wee
13 2416 know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects:
13 2417 if his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes
13 2418 the Cryme of it out of vs
13 2419 
13 2420    Williams. But if the Cause be not good, the King himselfe
13 2421 hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those
13 2422 Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile,
13 2423 shall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dyed
13 2424 at such a place, some swearing, some crying for a Surgean;
13 2425 some vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them;
13 2426 some vpon the Debts they owe, some vpon their Children
13 2427 rawly left: I am afear'd, there are few dye well, that dye
13 2428 in a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any
13 2429 thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men
13 2430 doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King,
13 2431 that led them to it; who to disobey, were against all proportion
13 2432 of subiection
13 2433 
13 2434    King. So, if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about
13 2435 Merchandize, doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea; the imputation
13 2436 of his wickednesse, by your rule, should be imposed
13 2437 vpon his Father that sent him: or if a Seruant, vnder
13 2438 his Masters command, transporting a summe of Money,
13 2439 be assayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil'd
13 2440 Iniquities; you may call the businesse of the Master the
13 2441 author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not so:
13 2442 The King is not bound to answer the particular endings
13 2443 of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master
13 2444 of his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when
13 2445 they purpose their seruices. Besides, there is no King, be
13 2446 his Cause neuer so spotlesse, if it come to the arbitrement
13 2447 of Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Souldiers:
13 2448 some (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of
13 2449 premeditated and contriued Murther; some, of beguiling
13 2450 Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; some,
13 2451 making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before gored
13 2452 the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robberie.
13 2453 Now, if these men haue defeated the Law, and outrunne
13 2454 Natiue punishment; though they can out-strip
13 2455 men, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is
13 2456 his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: so that here men
13 2457 are punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in
13 2458 now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death,
13 2459 they haue borne life away; and where they would bee
13 2460 safe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more
13 2461 is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was before
13 2462 guiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are
13 2463 now visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but
13 2464 euery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore should
13 2465 euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in
13 2466 his Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and
13 2467 dying so, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying,
13 2468 the time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was
13 2469 gayned: and in him that escapes, it were not sinne to
13 2470 thinke, that making God so free an offer, he let him outliue
13 2471 that day, to see his Greatnesse, and to teach others
13 2472 how they should prepare
13 2473 
13 2474    Will. 'Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon
13 2475 his owne head, the King is not to answer it
13 2476 
13 2477    Bates. I doe not desire hee should answer for me, and
13 2478 yet I determine to fight lustily for him
13 2479 
13 2480    King. I my selfe heard the King say he would not be
13 2481 ransom'd
13 2482 
13 2483    Will. I, hee said so, to make vs fight chearefully: but
13 2484 when our throats are cut, hee may be ransom'd, and wee
13 2485 ne're the wiser
13 2486 
13 2487    King. If I liue to see it, I will neuer trust his word after
13 2488 
13 2489    Will. You pay him then: that's a perillous shot out
13 2490 of an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate displeasure
13 2491 can doe against a Monarch: you may as well goe about
13 2492 to turne the Sunne to yce, with fanning in his face with a
13 2493 Peacocks feather: You'le neuer trust his word after;
13 2494 come, 'tis a foolish saying
13 2495 
13 2496    King. Your reproofe is something too round, I should
13 2497 be angry with you, if the time were conuenient
13 2498 
13 2499    Will. Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs, if you
13 2500 liue
13 2501 
13 2502    King. I embrace it
13 2503 
13 2504    Will. How shall I know thee againe?
13 2505   King. Giue me any Gage of thine, and I will weare it
13 2506 in my Bonnet: Then if euer thou dar'st acknowledge it,
13 2507 I will make it my Quarrell
13 2508 
13 2509    Will. Heere's my Gloue: Giue mee another of
13 2510 thine
13 2511 
13 2512    King. There
13 2513 
13 2514    Will. This will I also weare in my Cap: if euer thou
13 2515 come to me, and say, after to morrow, This is my Gloue,
13 2516 by this Hand I will take thee a box on the eare
13 2517 
13 2518    King. If euer I liue to see it, I will challenge it
13 2519 
13 2520    Will. Thou dar'st as well be hang'd
13 2521 
13 2522    King. Well, I will doe it, though I take thee in the
13 2523 Kings companie
13 2524 
13 2525    Will. Keepe thy word: fare thee well
13 2526 
13 2527    Bates. Be friends you English fooles, be friends, wee
13 2528 haue French Quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.
13 2529 
13 2530 Exit Souldiers.
13 2531 
13 2532   King. Indeede the French may lay twentie French
13 2533 Crownes to one, they will beat vs, for they beare them
13 2534 on their shoulders: but it is no English Treason to cut
13 2535 French Crownes, and to morrow the King himselfe will
13 2536 be a Clipper.
13 2537 Vpon the King, let vs our Liues, our Soules,
13 2538 Our Debts, our carefull Wiues,
13 2539 Our Children, and our Sinnes, lay on the King:
13 2540 We must beare all.
13 2541 O hard Condition, Twin-borne with Greatnesse,
13 2542 Subiect to the breath of euery foole, whose sence
13 2543 No more can feele, but his owne wringing.
13 2544 What infinite hearts-ease must Kings neglect,
13 2545 That priuate men enioy?
13 2546 And what haue Kings, that Priuates haue not too,
13 2547 Saue Ceremonie, saue generall Ceremonie?
13 2548 And what art thou, thou Idoll Ceremonie?
13 2549 What kind of God art thou? that suffer'st more
13 2550 Of mortall griefes, then doe thy worshippers.
13 2551 What are thy Rents? what are thy Commings in?
13 2552 O Ceremonie, shew me but thy worth.
13 2553 What? is thy Soule of Odoration?
13 2554 Art thou ought else but Place, Degree, and Forme,
13 2555 Creating awe and feare in other men?
13 2556 Wherein thou art lesse happy, being fear'd,
13 2557 Then they in fearing.
13 2558 What drink'st thou oft, in stead of Homage sweet,
13 2559 But poyson'd flatterie? O, be sick, great Greatnesse,
13 2560 And bid thy Ceremonie giue thee cure.
13 2561 Thinks thou the fierie Feuer will goe out
13 2562 With Titles blowne from Adulation?
13 2563 Will it giue place to flexure and low bending?
13 2564 Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggers knee,
13 2565 Command the health of it? No, thou prowd Dreame,
13 2566 That play'st so subtilly with a Kings Repose.
13 2567 I am a King that find thee: and I know,
13 2568 'Tis not the Balme, the Scepter, and the Ball,
13 2569 The Sword, the Mase, the Crowne Imperiall,
13 2570 The enter-tissued Robe of Gold and Pearle,
13 2571 The farsed Title running 'fore the King,
13 2572 The Throne he sits on: nor the Tyde of Pompe,
13 2573 That beates vpon the high shore of this World:
13 2574 No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous Ceremonie;
13 2575 Not all these, lay'd in Bed Maiesticall,
13 2576 Can sleepe so soundly, as the wretched Slaue:
13 2577 Who with a body fill'd, and vacant mind,
13 2578 Gets him to rest, cram'd with distressefull bread,
13 2579 Neuer sees horride Night, the Child of Hell:
13 2580 But like a Lacquey, from the Rise to Set,
13 2581 Sweates in the eye of Phebus; and all Night
13 2582 Sleepes in Elizium: next day after dawne,
13 2583 Doth rise and helpe Hiperio[n] to his Horse,
13 2584 And followes so the euer-running yeere
13 2585 With profitable labour to his Graue:
13 2586 And but for Ceremonie, such a Wretch,
13 2587 Winding vp Dayes with toyle, and Nights with sleepe,
13 2588 Had the fore-hand and vantage of a King.
13 2589 The Slaue, a Member of the Countreyes peace,
13 2590 Enioyes it; but in grosse braine little wots,
13 2591 What watch the King keepes, to maintaine the peace;
13 2592 Whose howres, the Pesant best aduantages.
13 2593 Enter Erpingham.
13 2594 
13 2595   Erp. My Lord, your Nobles iealous of your absence,
13 2596 Seeke through your Campe to find you
13 2597 
13 2598    King. Good old Knight, collect them all together
13 2599 At my Tent: Ile be before thee
13 2600 
13 2601    Erp. I shall doo't, my Lord.
13 2602 Enter.
13 2603 
13 2604   King. O God of Battailes, steele my Souldiers hearts,
13 2605 Possesse them not with feare: Take from them now
13 2606 The sence of reckning of th' opposed numbers:
13 2607 Pluck their hearts from them. Not to day, O Lord,
13 2608 O not to day, thinke not vpon the fault
13 2609 My Father made, in compassing the Crowne.
13 2610 I Richards body haue interred new,
13 2611 And on it haue bestowed more contrite teares,
13 2612 Then from it issued forced drops of blood.
13 2613 Fiue hundred poore I haue in yeerely pay,
13 2614 Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold vp
13 2615 Toward Heauen, to pardon blood:
13 2616 And I haue built two Chauntries,
13 2617 Where the sad and solemne Priests sing still
13 2618 For Richards Soule. More will I doe:
13 2619 Though all that I can doe, is nothing worth;
13 2620 Since that my Penitence comes after all,
13 2621 Imploring pardon.
13 2622 Enter Gloucester.
13 2623 
13 2624   Glouc. My Liege
13 2625 
13 2626    King. My Brother Gloucesters voyce? I:
13 2627 I know thy errand, I will goe with thee:
13 2628 The day, my friend, and all things stay for me.
13 2629 
13 2630 Exeunt.
13 2631 
13 2632 Enter the Dolphin, Orleance, Ramburs, and Beaumont.
13 2633 
13 2634   Orleance. The Sunne doth gild our Armour vp, my
13 2635 Lords
13 2636 
13 2637    Dolph. Monte Cheual: My Horse, Verlot Lacquay:
13 2638 Ha
13 2639 
13 2640    Orleance. Oh braue Spirit
13 2641 
13 2642    Dolph. Via les ewes & terre
13 2643 
13 2644    Orleance. Rien puis le air & feu
13 2645 
13 2646    Dolph. Cein, Cousin Orleance.
13 2647 Enter Constable.
13 2648 
13 2649 Now my Lord Constable?
13 2650   Const. Hearke how our Steedes, for present Seruice
13 2651 neigh
13 2652 
13 2653    Dolph. Mount them, and make incision in their Hides,
13 2654 That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
13 2655 And doubt them with superfluous courage: ha
13 2656 
13 2657    Ram. What, wil you haue them weep our Horses blood?
13 2658 How shall we then behold their naturall teares?
13 2659 Enter Messenger.
13 2660 
13 2661   Messeng. The English are embattail'd, you French
13 2662 Peeres
13 2663 
13 2664    Const. To Horse you gallant Princes, straight to Horse.
13 2665 Doe but behold yond poore and starued Band,
13 2666 And your faire shew shall suck away their Soules,
13 2667 Leauing them but the shales and huskes of men.
13 2668 There is not worke enough for all our hands,
13 2669 Scarce blood enough in all their sickly Veines,
13 2670 To giue each naked Curtleax a stayne,
13 2671 That our French Gallants shall to day draw out,
13 2672 And sheath for lack of sport. Let vs but blow on them,
13 2673 The vapour of our Valour will o're-turne them.
13 2674 'Tis positiue against all exceptions, Lords,
13 2675 That our superfluous Lacquies, and our Pesants,
13 2676 Who in vnnecessarie action swarme
13 2677 About our Squares of Battaile, were enow
13 2678 To purge this field of such a hilding Foe;
13 2679 Though we vpon this Mountaines Basis by,
13 2680 Tooke stand for idle speculation:
13 2681 But that our Honours must not. What's to say?
13 2682 A very little little let vs doe,
13 2683 And all is done: then let the Trumpets sound
13 2684 The Tucket Sonuance, and the Note to mount:
13 2685 For our approach shall so much dare the field,
13 2686 That England shall couch downe in feare, and yeeld.
13 2687 Enter Graundpree.
13 2688 
13 2689   Grandpree. Why do you stay so long, my Lords of France?
13 2690 Yond Iland Carrions, desperate of their bones,
13 2691 Ill-fauoredly become the Morning field:
13 2692 Their ragged Curtaines poorely are let loose,
13 2693 And our Ayre shakes them passing scornefully.
13 2694 Bigge Mars seemes banqu'rout in their begger'd Hoast,
13 2695 And faintly through a rustie Beuer peepes.
13 2696 The Horsemen sit like fixed Candlesticks,
13 2697 With Torch-staues in their hand: and their poore Iades
13 2698 Lob downe their heads, dropping the hides and hips:
13 2699 The gumme downe roping from their pale-dead eyes,
13 2700 And in their pale dull mouthes the Iymold Bitt
13 2701 Lyes foule with chaw'd-grasse, still and motionlesse.
13 2702 And their executors, the knauish Crowes,
13 2703 Flye o're them all, impatient for their howre.
13 2704 Description cannot sute it selfe in words,
13 2705 To demonstrate the Life of such a Battaile,
13 2706 In life so liuelesse, as it shewes it selfe
13 2707 
13 2708    Const. They haue said their prayers,
13 2709 And they stay for death
13 2710 
13 2711    Dolph. Shall we goe send them Dinners, and fresh Sutes,
13 2712 And giue their fasting Horses Prouender,
13 2713 And after fight with them?
13 2714   Const. I stay but for my Guard: on
13 2715 To the field, I will the Banner from a Trumpet take,
13 2716 And vse it for my haste. Come, come away,
13 2717 The Sunne is high, and we out-weare the day.
13 2718 
13 2719 Exeunt.
13 2720 
13 2721 Enter Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Erpingham with all his Hoast:
13 2722 Salisbury, and Westmerland.
13 2723 
13 2724   Glouc. Where is the King?
13 2725   Bedf. The King himselfe is rode to view their Battaile
13 2726 
13 2727    West. Of fighting men they haue full threescore thousand
13 2728 
13 2729    Exe. There's fiue to one, besides they all are fresh
13 2730 
13 2731    Salisb. Gods Arme strike with vs, 'tis a fearefull oddes.
13 2732 God buy' you Princes all; Ile to my Charge:
13 2733 If we no more meet, till we meet in Heauen;
13 2734 Then ioyfully, my Noble Lord of Bedford,
13 2735 My deare Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
13 2736 And my kind Kinsman, Warriors all, adieu
13 2737 
13 2738    Bedf. Farwell good Salisbury, & good luck go with thee:
13 2739 And yet I doe thee wrong, to mind thee of it,
13 2740 For thou art fram'd of the firme truth of valour
13 2741 
13 2742    Exe. Farwell kind Lord: fight valiantly to day
13 2743 
13 2744    Bedf. He is as full of Valour as of Kindnesse,
13 2745 Princely in both.
13 2746 Enter the King.
13 2747 
13 2748   West. O that we now had here
13 2749 But one ten thousand of those men in England,
13 2750 That doe no worke to day
13 2751 
13 2752    King. What's he that wishes so?
13 2753 My Cousin Westmerland. No, my faire Cousin:
13 2754 If we are markt to dye, we are enow
13 2755 To doe our Countrey losse: and if to liue,
13 2756 The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
13 2757 Gods will, I pray thee wish not one man more.
13 2758 By Ioue, I am not couetous for Gold,
13 2759 Nor care I who doth feed vpon my cost:
13 2760 It yernes me not, if men my Garments weare;
13 2761 Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
13 2762 But if it be a sinne to couet Honor,
13 2763 I am the most offending Soule aliue.
13 2764 No 'faith, my Couze, wish not a man from England:
13 2765 Gods peace, I would not loose so great an Honor,
13 2766 As one man more me thinkes would share from me,
13 2767 For the best hope I haue. O, doe not wish one more:
13 2768 Rather proclaime it (Westmerland) through my Hoast,
13 2769 That he which hath no stomack to this fight,
13 2770 Let him depart, his Pasport shall be made,
13 2771 And Crownes for Conuoy put into his Purse:
13 2772 We would not dye in that mans companie,
13 2773 That feares his fellowship, to dye with vs.
13 2774 This day is call'd the Feast of Crispian:
13 2775 He that out-liues this day, and comes safe home,
13 2776 Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,
13 2777 And rowse him at the Name of Crispian.
13 2778 He that shall see this day, and liue old age,
13 2779 Will yeerely on the Vigil feast his neighbours,
13 2780 And say, to morrow is Saint Crispian.
13 2781 Then will he strip his sleeue, and shew his skarres:
13 2782 Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot:
13 2783 But hee'le remember, with aduantages,
13 2784 What feats he did that day. Then shall our Names,
13 2785 Familiar in his mouth as household words,
13 2786 Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
13 2787 Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
13 2788 Be in their flowing Cups freshly remembred.
13 2789 This story shall the good man teach his sonne:
13 2790 And Crispine Crispian shall ne're goe by,
13 2791 From this day to the ending of the World,
13 2792 But we in it shall be remembred;
13 2793 We few, we happy few, we band of brothers:
13 2794 For he to day that sheds his blood with me,
13 2795 Shall be my brother: be he ne're so vile,
13 2796 This day shall gentle his Condition.
13 2797 And Gentlemen in England, now a bed,
13 2798 Shall thinke themselues accurst they were not here;
13 2799 And hold their Manhoods cheape, whiles any speakes,
13 2800 That fought with vs vpon Saint Crispines day.
13 2801 Enter Salisbury.
13 2802 
13 2803   Sal. My Soueraign Lord, bestow your selfe with speed:
13 2804 The French are brauely in their battailes set,
13 2805 And will with all expedience charge on vs
13 2806 
13 2807    King. All things are ready, if our minds be so
13 2808 
13 2809    West. Perish the man, whose mind is backward now
13 2810 
13 2811    King. Thou do'st not wish more helpe from England,
13 2812 Couze?
13 2813   West. Gods will, my Liege, would you and I alone,
13 2814 Without more helpe, could fight this Royall battaile
13 2815 
13 2816    King. Why now thou hast vnwisht fiue thousand men:
13 2817 Which likes me better, then to wish vs one.
13 2818 You know your places: God be with you all.
13 2819 
13 2820 Tucket. Enter Montioy.
13 2821 
13 2822   Mont. Once more I come to know of thee King Harry,
13 2823 If for thy Ransome thou wilt now compound,
13 2824 Before thy most assured Ouerthrow:
13 2825 For certainly, thou art so neere the Gulfe,
13 2826 Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy
13 2827 The Constable desires thee, thou wilt mind
13 2828 Thy followers of Repentance; that their Soules
13 2829 May make a peacefull and a sweet retyre
13 2830 From off these fields: where (wretches) their poore bodies
13 2831 Must lye and fester
13 2832 
13 2833    King. Who hath sent thee now?
13 2834   Mont. The Constable of France
13 2835 
13 2836    King. I pray thee beare my former Answer back:
13 2837 Bid them atchieue me, and then sell my bones.
13 2838 Good God, why should they mock poore fellowes thus?
13 2839 The man that once did sell the Lyons skin
13 2840 While the beast liu'd, was kill'd with hunting him.
13 2841 A many of our bodyes shall no doubt
13 2842 Find Natiue Graues: vpon the which, I trust
13 2843 Shall witnesse liue in Brasse of this dayes worke.
13 2844 And those that leaue their valiant bones in France,
13 2845 Dying like men, though buryed in your Dunghills,
13 2846 They shall be fam'd: for there the Sun shall greet them,
13 2847 And draw their honors reeking vp to Heauen,
13 2848 Leauing their earthly parts to choake your Clyme,
13 2849 The smell whereof shall breed a Plague in France.
13 2850 Marke then abounding valour in our English:
13 2851 That being dead, like to the bullets crasing,
13 2852 Breake out into a second course of mischiefe,
13 2853 Killing in relapse of Mortalitie.
13 2854 Let me speake prowdly: Tell the Constable,
13 2855 We are but Warriors for the working day:
13 2856 Our Gaynesse and our Gilt are all besmyrcht
13 2857 With raynie Marching in the painefull field.
13 2858 There's not a piece of feather in our Hoast:
13 2859 Good argument (I hope) we will not flye:
13 2860 And time hath worne vs into slouenrie.
13 2861 But by the Masse, our hearts are in the trim:
13 2862 And my poore Souldiers tell me, yet ere Night,
13 2863 They'le be in fresher Robes, or they will pluck
13 2864 The gay new Coats o're the French Souldiers heads,
13 2865 And turne them out of seruice. If they doe this,
13 2866 As if God please, they shall; my Ransome then
13 2867 Will soone be leuyed.
13 2868 Herauld, saue thou thy labour:
13 2869 Come thou no more for Ransome, gentle Herauld,
13 2870 They shall haue none, I sweare, but these my ioynts:
13 2871 Which if they haue, as I will leaue vm them,
13 2872 Shall yeeld them little, tell the Constable
13 2873 
13 2874    Mont. I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
13 2875 Thou neuer shalt heare Herauld any more.
13 2876 Enter.
13 2877 
13 2878   King. I feare thou wilt once more come againe for a
13 2879 Ransome.
13 2880 Enter Yorke.
13 2881 
13 2882   Yorke. My Lord, most humbly on my knee I begge
13 2883 The leading of the Vaward
13 2884 
13 2885    King. Take it, braue Yorke.
13 2886 Now Souldiers march away,
13 2887 And how thou pleasest God, dispose the day.
13 2888 
13 2889 Exeunt.

13 2898 What is thy Name? discusse
13 2899 
13 2900    French. O Seigneur Dieu
13 2901

13 2903 my words O Signieur Dewe, and marke: O Signieur
13 2904 Dewe, thou dyest on point of Fox, except O Signieur
13 2905 thou doe giue to me egregious Ransome
13 2906 
13 2907    French. O prennes miserecordie aye pitez de moy
13 2908 
13 2909    Pist. Moy shall not serue, I will haue fortie Moyes: for
13 2910 I will fetch thy rymme out at thy Throat, in droppes of
13 2911 Crimson blood
13 2912 
13 2913    French. Est il impossible d' eschapper le force de ton bras
13 2914 
13 2915    Pist. Brasse, Curre? thou damned and luxurious Mountaine
13 2916 Goat, offer'st me Brasse?
13 2917   French. O perdonne moy

13 2920 Come hither boy, aske me this slaue in French what is his
13 2921 Name
13 2922

13 2927 
13 2928    Pist. M. Fer: Ile fer him, and firke him, and ferret him:
13 2929 discusse the same in French vnto him
13 2930 
13 2931    Boy. I doe not know the French for fer, and ferret, and
13 2932 firke
13 2933 
13 2934    Pist. Bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat
13 2935 
13 2936    French. Que dit il Mounsieur?
13 2937   Boy. Il me commande a vous dire que vous faite vous
13 2938 prest, car ce soldat icy est disposee tout asture de couppes vostre
13 2939 gorge

13 2943 thou be by this my Sword
13 2944

13 2946 Ie suis le Gentilhome de bon maison, garde ma vie, & Ie
13 2947 vous donneray deux cent escus
13 2948 
13 2949    Pist. What are his words?
13 2950   Boy. He prayes you to saue his life, he is a Gentleman
13 2951 of a good house, and for his ransom he will giue you two
13 2952 hundred Crownes
13 2953 
13 2954    Pist. Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the Crownes
13 2955 will take
13 2956 
13 2957    Fren. Petit Monsieur que dit il?
13 2958   Boy. Encore qu'il et contra son Iurement, de pardonner aucune
13 2959 prisonner: neantmons pour les escues que vous layt a promets,
13 2960 il est content a vous donnes le liberte le franchisement

13 2963 Ie me estime heurex que Ie intombe, entre les main d' vn Cheualier
13 2964 Ie pense le plus braue valiant et tres distime signieur
13 2965 d' Angleterre
13 2966 
13 2967    Pist. Expound vnto me boy
13 2968 
13 2969    Boy. He giues you vpon his knees a thousand thanks,
13 2970 and he esteemes himselfe happy, that he hath falne into
13 2971 the hands of one (as he thinkes) the most braue, valorous
13 2972 and thrice-worthy signeur of England
13 2973 
13 2974    Pist. As I sucke blood, I will some mercy shew. Follow
13 2975 mee
13 2976 
13 2977    Boy. Saaue vous le grand Capitaine?
13 2978 I did neuer know so full a voyce issue from so emptie a
13 2979 heart: but the saying is true, The empty vessel makes the
13 2980 greatest sound, Bardolfe and Nym had tenne times more
13 2981 valour, then this roaring diuell i'th olde play, that euerie
13 2982 one may payre his nayles with a woodden dagger, and
13 2983 they are both hang'd, and so would this be, if hee durst
13 2984 steale any thing aduenturously. I must stay with the
13 2985 Lackies with the luggage of our camp, the French might
13 2986 haue a good pray of vs, if he knew of it, for there is none
13 2987 to guard it but boyes.
13 2988 Enter.
13 2989 
13 2990 Enter Constable, Orleance, Burbon, Dolphin, and Rambures.
13 2991 
13 2992   Con. O Diable
13 2993 
13 2994    Orl. O signeur le iour et perdia, toute et perdie
13 2995 
13 2996    Dol. Mor Dieu ma vie, all is confounded all,
13 2997 Reproach, and euerlasting shame
13 2998 Sits mocking in our Plumes.
13 2999 
13 3000 A short Alarum.
13 3001 
13 3002 O meschante Fortune, do not runne away
13 3003 
13 3004    Con. Why all our rankes are broke
13 3005 
13 3006    Dol. O perdurable shame, let's stab our selues:
13 3007 Be these the wretches that we plaid at dice for?
13 3008   Orl. Is this the King we sent too, for his ransome?
13 3009   Bur. Shame, and eternall shame, nothing but shame,
13 3010 Let vs dye in once more backe againe,
13 3011 And he that will not follow Burbon now,
13 3012 Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand
13 3013 Like a base Pander hold the Chamber doore,
13 3014 Whilst a base slaue, no gentler then my dogge,
13 3015 His fairest daughter is contaminated
13 3016 
13 3017    Con. Disorder that hath spoyl'd vs, friend vs now,
13 3018 Let vs on heapes go offer vp our liues
13 3019 
13 3020    Orl. We are enow yet liuing in the Field,
13 3021 To smother vp the English in our throngs,
13 3022 If any order might be thought vpon
13 3023 
13 3024    Bur. The diuell take Order now, Ile to the throng;
13 3025 Let life be short, else shame will be too long.
13 3026 Enter.
13 3027 
13 3028 Alarum. Enter the King and his trayne, with Prisoners.
13 3029 
13 3030   King. Well haue we done, thrice-valiant Countrimen,
13 3031 But all's not done, yet keepe the French the field
13 3032 
13 3033    Exe. The D[uke]. of York commends him to your Maiesty
13 3034   King. Liues he good Vnckle: thrice within this houre
13 3035 I saw him downe; thrice vp againe, and fighting,
13 3036 From Helmet to the spurre, all blood he was
13 3037 
13 3038    Exe. In which array (braue Soldier) doth he lye,
13 3039 Larding the plaine: and by his bloody side,
13 3040 (Yoake-fellow to his honour-owing-wounds)
13 3041 The Noble Earle of Suffolke also lyes.
13 3042 Suffolke first dyed, and Yorke all hagled ouer
13 3043 Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteeped,
13 3044 And takes him by the Beard, kisses the gashes
13 3045 That bloodily did yawne vpon his face.
13 3046 He cryes aloud; Tarry my Cosin Suffolke,
13 3047 My soule shall thine keepe company to heauen:
13 3048 Tarry (sweet soule) for mine, then flye a-brest:
13 3049 As in this glorious and well-foughten field
13 3050 We kept together in our Chiualrie.
13 3051 Vpon these words I came, and cheer'd him vp,
13 3052 He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand,
13 3053 And with a feeble gripe, sayes: Deere my Lord,
13 3054 Commend my seruice to my Soueraigne,
13 3055 So did he turne, and ouer Suffolkes necke
13 3056 He threw his wounded arme, and kist his lippes,
13 3057 And so espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
13 3058 A Testament of Noble-ending-loue:
13 3059 The prettie and sweet manner of it forc'd
13 3060 Those waters from me, which I would haue stop'd,
13 3061 But I had not so much of man in mee,
13 3062 And all my mother came into mine eyes,
13 3063 And gaue me vp to teares
13 3064 
13 3065    King. I blame you not,
13 3066 For hearing this, I must perforce compound
13 3067 With mixtfull eyes, or they will issue to.
13 3068 
13 3069 Alarum
13 3070 
13 3071 But hearke, what new alarum is this same?
13 3072 The French haue re-enforc'd their scatter'd men:
13 3073 Then euery souldiour kill his Prisoners,
13 3074 Giue the word through.
13 3075 
13 3076 Exit
13 3077 
13 3078 
13 3079 Actus Quartus.
13 3080 
13 3081 Enter Fluellen and Gower.
13 3082 
13 3083   Flu. Kill the poyes and the luggage, 'Tis expressely
13 3084 against the Law of Armes, tis as arrant a peece of knauery
13 3085 marke you now, as can bee offert in your Conscience
13 3086 now, is it not?
13 3087   Gow. Tis certaine, there's not a boy left aliue, and the
13 3088 Cowardly Rascalls that ranne from the battaile ha' done
13 3089 this slaughter: besides they haue burned and carried away
13 3090 all that was in the Kings Tent, wherefore the King
13 3091 most worthily hath caus'd euery soldiour to cut his prisoners
13 3092 throat. O 'tis a gallant King
13 3093 
13 3094    Flu. I, hee was porne at Monmouth Captaine Gower:
13 3095 What call you the Townes name where Alexander the
13 3096 pig was borne?
13 3097   Gow. Alexander the Great
13 3098 
13 3099    Flu. Why I pray you, is not pig, great? The pig, or
13 3100 the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous,
13 3101 are all one reckonings, saue the phrase is a litle variations
13 3102 
13 3103    Gower. I thinke Alexander the Great was borne in
13 3104 Macedon, his Father was called Phillip of Macedon, as I
13 3105 take it
13 3106 
13 3107    Flu. I thinke it is in Macedon where Alexander is
13 3108 porne: I tell you Captaine, if you looke in the Maps of
13 3109 the Orld, I warrant you sall finde in the comparisons betweene
13 3110 Macedon & Monmouth, that the situations looke
13 3111 you, is both alike. There is a Riuer in Macedon, & there
13 3112 is also moreouer a Riuer at Monmouth, it is call'd Wye at
13 3113 Monmouth: but it is out of my praines, what is the name
13 3114 of the other Riuer: but 'tis all one, tis alike as my fingers
13 3115 is to my fingers, and there is Salmons in both. If you
13 3116 marke Alexanders life well, Harry of Monmouthes life is
13 3117 come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all
13 3118 things. Alexander God knowes, and you know, in his
13 3119 rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and
13 3120 his moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations,
13 3121 and also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in
13 3122 his Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend
13 3123 Clytus
13 3124 
13 3125    Gow. Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill'd
13 3126 any of his friends
13 3127 
13 3128    Flu. It is not well done (marke you now) to take the
13 3129 tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
13 3130 but in the figures, and comparisons of it: as Alexander
13 3131 kild his friend Clytus, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; so
13 3132 also Harry Monmouth being in his right wittes, and his
13 3133 good iudgements, turn'd away the fat Knight with the
13 3134 great belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and
13 3135 knaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name
13 3136 
13 3137    Gow. Sir Iohn Falstaffe
13 3138 
13 3139    Flu. That is he: Ile tell you, there is good men porne
13 3140 at Monmouth
13 3141 
13 3142    Gow. Heere comes his Maiesty.
13 3143 
13 3144 Alarum. Enter King Harry and Burbon with prisoners. Flourish.
13 3145 
13 3146   King. I was not angry since I came to France,
13 3147 Vntill this instant. Take a Trumpet Herald,
13 3148 Ride thou vnto the Horsemen on yond hill:
13 3149 If they will fight with vs, bid them come downe,
13 3150 Or voyde the field: they do offend our sight.
13 3151 If they'l do neither, we will come to them,
13 3152 And make them sker away, as swift as stones
13 3153 Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
13 3154 Besides, wee'l cut the throats of those we haue,
13 3155 And not a man of them that we shall take,
13 3156 Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
13 3157 Enter Montioy.
13 3158 
13 3159   Exe. Here comes the Herald of the French, my Liege
13 3160   Glou. His eyes are humbler then they vs'd to be
13 3161 
13 3162    King. How now, what meanes this Herald? Knowst
13 3163 thou not,
13 3164 That I haue fin'd these bones of mine for ransome?
13 3165 Com'st thou againe for ransome?
13 3166   Her. No great King:
13 3167 I come to thee for charitable License,
13 3168 That we may wander ore this bloody field,
13 3169 To booke our dead, and then to bury them,
13 3170 To sort our Nobles from our common men.
13 3171 For many of our Princes (woe the while)
13 3172 Lye drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood:
13 3173 So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbes
13 3174 In blood of Princes, and with wounded steeds
13 3175 Fret fet-locke deepe in gore, and with wilde rage
13 3176 Yerke out their armed heeles at their dead masters,
13 3177 Killing them twice. O giue vs leaue great King,
13 3178 To view the field in safety, and dispose
13 3179 Of their dead bodies
13 3180 
13 3181    Kin. I tell thee truly Herald,
13 3182 I know not if the day be ours or no,
13 3183 For yet a many of your horsemen peere,
13 3184 And gallop ore the field
13 3185 
13 3186    Her. The day is yours
13 3187 
13 3188    Kin. Praised be God, and not our strength for it:
13 3189 What is this Castle call'd that stands hard by
13 3190 
13 3191    Her. They call it Agincourt
13 3192 
13 3193    King. Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
13 3194 Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus
13 3195 
13 3196    Flu. Your Grandfather of famous memory (an't please
13 3197 your Maiesty) and your great Vncle Edward the Placke
13 3198 Prince of Wales, as I haue read in the Chronicles, fought
13 3199 a most praue pattle here in France
13 3200 
13 3201    Kin. They did Fluellen
13 3202 
13 3203    Flu. Your Maiesty sayes very true: If your Maiesties
13 3204 is remembred of it, the Welchmen did good seruice in a
13 3205 Garden where Leekes did grow, wearing Leekes in their
13 3206 Monmouth caps, which your Maiesty know to this houre
13 3207 is an honourable badge of the seruice: And I do beleeue
13 3208 your Maiesty takes no scorne to weare the Leeke vppon
13 3209 S[aint]. Tauies day
13 3210 
13 3211    King. I weare it for a memorable honor:
13 3212 For I am Welch you know good Countriman
13 3213 
13 3214    Flu. All the water in Wye, cannot wash your Maiesties
13 3215 Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:
13 3216 God plesse it, and preserue it, as long as it pleases his
13 3217 Grace, and his Maiesty too
13 3218 
13 3219    Kin. Thankes good my Countrymen
13 3220 
13 3221    Flu. By Ieshu, I am your Maiesties Countreyman, I
13 3222 care not who know it: I will confesse it to all the Orld, I
13 3223 need not to be ashamed of your Maiesty, praised be God
13 3224 so long as your Maiesty is an honest man
13 3225 
13 3226    King. Good keepe me so.
13 3227 Enter Williams.
13 3228 
13 3229 Our Heralds go with him,
13 3230 Bring me iust notice of the numbers dead
13 3231 On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither
13 3232 
13 3233    Exe. Souldier, you must come to the King
13 3234 
13 3235    Kin. Souldier, why wear'st thou that Gloue in thy
13 3236 Cappe?
13 3237   Will. And't please your Maiesty, tis the gage of one
13 3238 that I should fight withall, if he be aliue
13 3239 
13 3240    Kin. An Englishman?
13 3241   Wil. And't please your Maiesty, a Rascall that swagger'd
13 3242 with me last night: who if aliue, and euer dare to
13 3243 challenge this Gloue, I haue sworne to take him a boxe
13 3244 a'th ere: or if I can see my Gloue in his cappe, which he
13 3245 swore as he was a Souldier he would weare (if aliue) I wil
13 3246 strike it out soundly
13 3247 
13 3248    Kin. What thinke you Captaine Fluellen, is it fit this
13 3249 souldier keepe his oath
13 3250 
13 3251    Flu. Hee is a Crauen and a Villaine else, and't please
13 3252 your Maiesty in my conscience

13 3255 sort quite from the answer of his degree
13 3256 
13 3257    Flu. Though he be as good a Ientleman as the diuel is,
13 3258 as Lucifer and Belzebub himselfe, it is necessary (looke
13 3259 your Grace) that he keepe his vow and his oath: If hee
13 3260 bee periur'd (see you now) his reputation is as arrant a
13 3261 villaine and a Iacke sawce, as euer his blacke shoo trodd
13 3262 vpon Gods ground, and his earth, in my conscience law
13 3263   King. Then keepe thy vow sirrah, when thou meet'st
13 3264 the fellow

13 3278 
13 3279   King. Here Fluellen, weare thou this fauour for me, and
13 3280 sticke it in thy Cappe: when Alanson and my selfe were
13 3281 downe together, I pluckt this Gloue from his Helme: If
13 3282 any man challenge this, hee is a friend to Alanson, and an
13 3283 enemy to our Person; if thou encounter any such, apprehend
13 3284 him, and thou do'st me loue
13 3285 
13 3286    Flu. Your Grace doo's me as great Honors as can be
13 3287 desir'd in the hearts of his Subiects: I would faine see
13 3288 the man, that ha's but two legges, that shall find himselfe
13 3289 agreefd at this Gloue; that is all: but I would faine see

13 3295    King. Pray thee goe seeke him, and bring him to my

13 3304 May haply purchase him a box a'th' eare.
13 3305 It is the Souldiers: I by bargaine should
13 3306 Weare it my selfe. Follow good Cousin Warwick:
13 3307 If that the Souldier strike him, as I iudge
13 3308 By his blunt bearing, he will keepe his word;
13 3309 Some sodaine mischiefe may arise of it:
13 3310 For I doe know Fluellen valiant,

13 3336 World, or in France, or in England

13 3343 
13 3344    Will. I am no Traytor

13 3348 Alansons.

13 3386 came any from mine, that might offend your Maiestie

13 3427 Full fifteene hundred, besides common men
13 3428 
13 3429    King. This Note doth tell me of ten thousand French
13 3430 That in the field lye slaine: of Princes in this number,
13 3431 And Nobles bearing Banners, there lye dead
13 3432 One hundred twentie six: added to these,
13 3433 Of Knights, Esquires, and gallant Gentlemen,

13 3435 Fiue hundred were but yesterday dubb'd Knights.
13 3436 So that in these ten thousand they haue lost,
13 3437 There are but sixteene hundred Mercenaries:

13 3456 O God, thy Arme was heere:
13 3457 And not to vs, but to thy Arme alone,
13 3458 Ascribe we all: when, without stratagem,
13 3459 But in plaine shock, and euen play of Battaile,
13 3460 Was euer knowne so great and little losse?
13 3461 On one part and on th' other, take it God,
13 3462 For it is none but thine
13 3463 
13 3464    Exet. 'Tis wonderfull
13 3465 
13 3466    King. Come, goe we in procession to the Village:
13 3467 And be it death proclaymed through our Hoast,
13 3468 To boast of this, or take that prayse from God,
13 3469 Which is his onely

13 3477 
13 3478    King. Doe we all holy Rights:
13 3479 Let there be sung Non nobis, and Te Deum,
13 3480 The dead with charitie enclos'd in Clay:
13 3481 And then to Callice, and to England then,
13 3482 Where ne're from France arriu'd more happy men.
13 3483 
13 3484 Exeunt.
13 3485 
13 3486 
13 3487 Actus Quintus.
13 3488 
13 3489 Enter Chorus.
13 3490 
13 3491 Vouchsafe to those that haue not read the Story,
13 3492 That I may prompt them: and of such as haue,
13 3493 I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse
13 3494 Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,
13 3495 Which cannot in their huge and proper life,
13 3496 Be here presented. Now we beare the King
13 3497 Toward Callice: Graunt him there; there seene,
13 3498 Heaue him away vpon your winged thoughts,
13 3499 Athwart the Sea: Behold the English beach
13 3500 Pales in the flood; with Men, Wiues, and Boyes,
13 3501 Whose shouts & claps out-voyce the deep-mouth'd Sea,
13 3502 Which like a mightie Whiffler 'fore the King,
13 3503 Seemes to prepare his way: So let him land,
13 3504 And solemnly see him set on to London.
13 3505 So swift a pace hath Thought, that euen now
13 3506 You may imagine him vpon Black-Heath:
13 3507 Where, that his Lords desire him, to haue borne
13 3508 His bruised Helmet, and his bended Sword
13 3509 Before him, through the Citie: he forbids it,
13 3510 Being free from vainnesse, and selfe-glorious pride;
13 3511 Giuing full Trophee, Signall, and Ostent,
13 3512 Quite from himselfe, to God. But now behold,
13 3513 In the quick Forge and working-house of Thought,
13 3514 How London doth powre out her Citizens,
13 3515 The Maior and all his Brethren in best sort,
13 3516 Like to the Senatours of th' antique Rome,
13 3517 With the Plebeians swarming at their heeles,
13 3518 Goe forth and fetch their Conqu'ring Cæsar in:
13 3519 As by a lower, but by louing likelyhood,
13 3520 Were now the Generall of our gracious Empresse,
13 3521 As in good time he may, from Ireland comming,
13 3522 Bringing Rebellion broached on his Sword;
13 3523 How many would the peacefull Citie quit,
13 3524 To welcome him? much more, and much more cause,
13 3525 Did they this Harry. Now in London place him.
13 3526 As yet the lamentation of the French
13 3527 Inuites the King of Englands stay at home:
13 3528 The Emperour's comming in behalfe of France,
13 3529 To order peace betweene them: and omit
13 3530 All the occurrences, what euer chanc't,
13 3531 Till Harryes backe returne againe to France:
13 3532 There must we bring him; and my selfe haue play'd
13 3533 The interim, by remembring you 'tis past.
13 3534 Then brooke abridgement, and your eyes aduance,
13 3535 After your thoughts, straight backe againe to France.
13 3536 Enter.
13 3537 
13 3538 Enter Fluellen and Gower.
13 3539 
13 3540   Gower. Nay, that's right: but why weare you your
13 3541 Leeke to day? S[aint]. Dauies day is past
13 3542 
13 3543    Flu. There is occasions and causes why and wherefore
13 3544 in all things: I will tell you asse my friend, Captaine
13 3545 Gower; the rascally, scauld, beggerly, lowsie, pragging
13 3546 Knaue Pistoll, which you and your selfe, and all the World,
13 3547 know to be no petter then a fellow, looke you now, of no
13 3548 merits: hee is come to me, and prings me pread and
13 3549 sault yesterday, looke you, and bid me eate my Leeke:
13 3550 it was in a place where I could not breed no contention
13 3551 with him; but I will be so bold as to weare it in my Cap
13 3552 till I see him once againe, and then I will tell him a little
13 3553 piece of my desires.
13 3554 Enter Pistoll.
13 3555 
13 3556   Gower. Why heere hee comes, swelling like a Turkycock
13 3557 
13 3558    Flu. 'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his Turkycocks.
13 3559 God plesse you aunchient Pistoll: you scuruie lowsie
13 3560 Knaue, God plesse you
13 3561 
13 3562    Pist. Ha, art thou bedlam? doest thou thirst, base
13 3563 Troian, to haue me fold vp Parcas fatall Web? Hence;
13 3564 I am qualmish at the smell of Leeke
13 3565 
13 3566    Flu. I peseech you heartily, scuruie lowsie Knaue, at
13 3567 my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eate,
13 3568 looke you, this Leeke; because, looke you, you doe not
13 3569 loue it, nor your affections, and your appetites and your
13 3570 disgestions doo's not agree with it, I would desire you
13 3571 to eate it
13 3572 
13 3573    Pist. Not for Cadwallader and all his Goats
13 3574 
13 3575    Flu. There is one Goat for you.
13 3576 
13 3577  Strikes him.
13 3578 
13 3579 Will you be so good, scauld Knaue, as eate it?
13 3580   Pist. Base Troian, thou shalt dye
13 3581 
13 3582    Flu. You say very true, scauld Knaue, when Gods
13 3583 will is: I will desire you to liue in the meane time, and
13 3584 eate your Victuals: come, there is sawce for it. You
13 3585 call'd me yesterday Mountaine-Squier, but I will make
13 3586 you to day a squire of low degree. I pray you fall too, if
13 3587 you can mocke a Leeke, you can eate a Leeke
13 3588 
13 3589    Gour. Enough Captaine, you haue astonisht him
13 3590 
13 3591    Flu. I say, I will make him eate some part of my leeke,
13 3592 or I will peate his pate foure dayes: bite I pray you, it is
13 3593 good for your greene wound, and your ploodie Coxecombe
13 3594 
13 3595    Pist. Must I bite
13 3596 
13 3597    Flu. Yes certainly, and out of doubt and out of question
13 3598 too, and ambiguities
13 3599 
13 3600    Pist. By this Leeke, I will most horribly reuenge I
13 3601 eate and eate I sweare
13 3602 
13 3603    Flu. Eate I pray you, will you haue some more sauce
13 3604 to your Leeke: there is not enough Leeke to sweare by
13 3605 
13 3606    Pist. Quiet thy Cudgell, thou dost see I eate
13 3607 
13 3608    Flu. Much good do you scald knaue, heartily. Nay,
13 3609 pray you throw none away, the skinne is good for your
13 3610 broken Coxcombe; when you take occasions to see
13 3611 Leekes heereafter, I pray you mocke at 'em, that is all
13 3612 
13 3613    Pist. Good
13 3614 
13 3615    Flu. I, Leekes is good: hold you, there is a groat to
13 3616 heale your pate
13 3617 
13 3618    Pist. Me a groat?
13 3619   Flu. Yes verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I haue
13 3620 another Leeke in my pocket, which you shall eate
13 3621 
13 3622    Pist. I take thy groat in earnest of reuenge
13 3623 
13 3624    Flu. If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in Cudgels,
13 3625 you shall be a Woodmonger, and buy nothing of
13 3626 me but cudgels: God bu'y you, and keepe you, & heale
13 3627 your pate.
13 3628 
13 3629 Exit
13 3630 
13 3631   Pist. All hell shall stirre for this
13 3632 
13 3633    Gow. Go, go, you are a counterfeit cowardly Knaue,
13 3634 will you mocke at an ancient Tradition began vppon an
13 3635 honourable respect, and worne as a memorable Trophee
13 3636 of predeceased valor, and dare not auouch in your deeds
13 3637 any of your words. I haue seene you gleeking & galling
13 3638 at this Gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because
13 3639 he could not speake English in the natiue garb, he could
13 3640 not therefore handle an English Cudgell: you finde it otherwise,
13 3641 and henceforth let a Welsh correction, teach
13 3642 you a good English condition, fare ye well.
13 3643 
13 3644 Exit
13 3645 
13 3646   Pist. Doeth fortune play the huswife with me now?
13 3647 Newes haue I that my Doll is dead i'th Spittle of a malady
13 3648 of France, and there my rendeuous is quite cut off:
13 3649 Old I do waxe, and from my wearie limbes honour is
13 3650 Cudgeld. Well, Baud Ile turne, and something leane to
13 3651 Cut-purse of quicke hand: To England will I steale, and
13 3652 there Ile steale:
13 3653 And patches will I get vnto these cudgeld scarres,
13 3654 And swore I got them in the Gallia warres.
13 3655 Enter.
13 3656 
13 3657 Enter at one doore, King Henry, Exeter, Bedford, Warwicke, and
13 3658 other

13 3661 other French.
13 3662 
13 3663   King. Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met;
13 3664 Vnto our brother France, and to our Sister
13 3665 Health and faire time of day: Ioy and good wishes
13 3666 To our most faire and Princely Cosine Katherine:
13 3667 And as a branch and member of this Royalty,
13 3668 By whom this great assembly is contriu'd,
13 3669 We do salute you Duke of Burgogne,
13 3670 And Princes French and Peeres health to you all
13 3671 
13 3672    Fra. Right ioyous are we to behold your face,
13 3673 Most worthy brother England, fairely met,
13 3674 So are you Princes (English) euery one
13 3675 
13 3676    Quee. So happy be the Issue brother Ireland
13 3677 Of this good day, and of this gracious meeting,
13 3678 As we are now glad to behold your eyes,
13 3679 Your eyes which hitherto haue borne
13 3680 In them against the French that met them in their bent,
13 3681 The fatall Balls of murthering Basiliskes:
13 3682 The venome of such Lookes we fairely hope
13 3683 Haue lost their qualitie, and that this day
13 3684 Shall change all griefes and quarrels into loue
13 3685 
13 3686    Eng. To cry Amen to that, thus we appeare
13 3687 
13 3688    Quee. You English Princes all, I doe salute you
13 3689 
13 3690    Burg. My dutie to you both, on equall loue.
13 3691 Great Kings of France and England: that I haue labour'd
13 3692 With all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors,
13 3693 To bring your most Imperiall Maiesties
13 3694 Vnto this Barre, and Royall enterview;
13 3695 Your Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse.
13 3696 Since then my Office hath so farre preuayl'd,
13 3697 That Face to Face, and Royall Eye to Eye,
13 3698 You haue congreeted: let it not disgrace me,
13 3699 If I demand before this Royall view,
13 3700 What Rub, or what Impediment there is,
13 3701 Why that the naked, poore, and mangled Peace,
13 3702 Deare Nourse of Arts, Plentyes, and ioyfull Births,
13 3703 Should not in this best Garden of the World,
13 3704 Our fertile France, put vp her louely Visage?
13 3705 Alas, shee hath from France too long been chas'd,
13 3706 And all her Husbandry doth lye on heapes,
13 3707 Corrupting in it owne fertilitie.
13 3708 Her Vine, the merry chearer of the heart,
13 3709 Vnpruned, dyes: her Hedges euen pleach'd,
13 3710 Like Prisoners wildly ouer-growne with hayre,
13 3711 Put forth disorder'd Twigs: her fallow Leas,
13 3712 The Darnell, Hemlock, and ranke Femetary,
13 3713 Doth root vpon; while that the Culter rusts,
13 3714 That should deracinate such Sauagery:
13 3715 The euen Meade, that erst brought sweetly forth
13 3716 The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and greene Clouer,
13 3717 Wanting the Sythe, withall vncorrected, ranke;
13 3718 Conceiues by idlenesse, and nothing teemes,
13 3719 But hatefull Docks, rough Thistles, Keksyes, Burres,
13 3720 Loosing both beautie and vtilitie;
13 3721 And all our Vineyards, Fallowes, Meades, and Hedges,
13 3722 Defectiue in their natures, grow to wildnesse.
13 3723 Euen so our Houses, and our selues, and Children,
13 3724 Haue lost, or doe not learne, for want of time,
13 3725 The Sciences that should become our Countrey;
13 3726 But grow like Sauages, as Souldiers will,
13 3727 That nothing doe, but meditate on Blood,
13 3728 To Swearing, and sterne Lookes, defus'd Attyre,
13 3729 And euery thing that seemes vnnaturall.
13 3730 Which to reduce into our former fauour,
13 3731 You are assembled: and my speech entreats,
13 3732 That I may know the Let, why gentle Peace
13 3733 Should not expell these inconueniences,
13 3734 And blesse vs with her former qualities
13 3735 
13 3736    Eng. If Duke of Burgonie, you would the Peace,
13 3737 Whose want giues growth to th' imperfections
13 3738 Which you haue cited; you must buy that Peace
13 3739 With full accord to all our iust demands,
13 3740 Whose Tenures and particular effects
13 3741 You haue enschedul'd briefely in your hands
13 3742 
13 3743    Burg. The King hath heard them: to the which, as yet
13 3744 There is no Answer made
13 3745 
13 3746    Eng. Well then: the Peace which you before so vrg'd,
13 3747 Lyes in his Answer
13 3748 
13 3749    France. I haue but with a curselarie eye
13 3750 O're-glanc't the Articles: Pleaseth your Grace
13 3751 To appoint some of your Councell presently
13 3752 To sit with vs once more, with better heed
13 3753 To re-suruey them; we will suddenly
13 3754 Passe our accept and peremptorie Answer
13 3755 
13 3756    England. Brother we shall. Goe Vnckle Exeter,
13 3757 And Brother Clarence, and you Brother Gloucester,
13 3758 Warwick, and Huntington, goe with the King,
13 3759 And take with you free power, to ratifie,
13 3760 Augment, or alter, as your Wisdomes best
13 3761 Shall see aduantageable for our Dignitie,
13 3762 Any thing in or out of our Demands,
13 3763 And wee'le consigne thereto. Will you, faire Sister,
13 3764 Goe with the Princes, or stay here with vs?
13 3765   Quee. Our gracious Brother, I will goe with them:
13 3766 Happily a Womans Voyce may doe some good,
13 3767 When Articles too nicely vrg'd, be stood on
13 3768 
13 3769    England. Yet leaue our Cousin Katherine here with vs,
13 3770 She is our capitall Demand, compris'd
13 3771 Within the fore-ranke of our Articles
13 3772 
13 3773    Quee. She hath good leaue.
13 3774 
13 3775 Exeunt. omnes.
13 3776 
13 3777 Manet King and Katherine
13 3778 
13 3779    King. Faire Katherine, and most faire,
13 3780 Will you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes,
13 3781 Such as will enter at a Ladyes eare,
13 3782 And pleade his Loue-suit to her gentle heart
13 3783 
13 3784    Kath. Your Maiestie shall mock at me, I cannot speake
13 3785 your England
13 3786 
13 3787    King. O faire Katherine, if you will loue me soundly
13 3788 with your French heart, I will be glad to heare you confesse
13 3789 it brokenly with your English Tongue. Doe you
13 3790 like me, Kate?
13 3791   Kath. Pardonne moy, I cannot tell wat is like me
13 3792 
13 3793    King. An Angell is like you Kate, and you are like an
13 3794 Angell
13 3795 
13 3796    Kath. Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges?
13 3797   Lady. Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il
13 3798 
13 3799    King. I said so, deare Katherine, and I must not blush
13 3800 to affirme it
13 3801 
13 3802    Kath. O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont plein de
13 3803 tromperies
13 3804 
13 3805    King. What sayes she, faire one? that the tongues of
13 3806 men are full of deceits?
13 3807   Lady. Ouy, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits:
13 3808 dat is de Princesse
13 3809 
13 3810    King. The Princesse is the better English-woman:
13 3811 yfaith Kate, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am
13 3812 glad thou canst speake no better English, for if thou
13 3813 could'st, thou would'st finde me such a plaine King, that
13 3814 thou wouldst thinke, I had sold my Farme to buy my
13 3815 Crowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but directly
13 3816 to say, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther,
13 3817 then to say, Doe you in faith? I weare out my suite: Giue
13 3818 me your answer, yfaith doe, and so clap hands, and a bargaine:
13 3819 how say you, Lady?
13 3820   Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, me vnderstand well
13 3821 
13 3822    King. Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to
13 3823 Dance for your sake, Kate, why you vndid me: for the one
13 3824 I haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I
13 3825 haue no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in
13 3826 strength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by
13 3827 vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe;
13 3828 vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken. I should
13 3829 quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my
13 3830 Loue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on
13 3831 like a Butcher, and sit like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But
13 3832 before God Kate, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out
13 3833 my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation;
13 3834 onely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg'd,
13 3835 nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow
13 3836 of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth Sunne-burning?
13 3837 that neuer lookes in his Glasse, for loue of any
13 3838 thing he sees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I speake
13 3839 to thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this,
13 3840 take me? if not? to say to thee that I shall dye, is true; but
13 3841 for thy loue, by the L[ord]. No: yet I loue thee too. And
13 3842 while thou liu'st, deare Kate, take a fellow of plaine and
13 3843 vncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right,
13 3844 because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for
13 3845 these fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues
13 3846 into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues
13 3847 out againe. What? a speaker is but a prater, a Ryme is
13 3848 but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a strait Backe will
13 3849 stoope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl'd Pate will
13 3850 grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax
13 3851 hollow: but a good Heart, Kate, is the Sunne and the
13 3852 Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it
13 3853 shines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course
13 3854 truly. If thou would haue such a one, take me? and
13 3855 take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King.
13 3856 And what say'st thou then to my Loue? speake my faire,
13 3857 and fairely, I pray thee
13 3858 
13 3859    Kath. Is it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of
13 3860 Fraunce?
13 3861   King. No, it is not possible you should loue the Enemie
13 3862 of France, Kate; but in louing me, you should loue
13 3863 the Friend of France: for I loue France so well, that I
13 3864 will not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine:
13 3865 and Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours
13 3866 is France, and you are mine
13 3867 
13 3868    Kath. I cannot tell wat is dat
13 3869 
13 3870    King. No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am
13 3871 sure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new-married Wife
13 3872 about her Husbands Necke, hardly to be shooke off; Ie
13 3873 quand sur le possession de Fraunce, & quand vous aues le
13 3874 possession
13 3875 de moy. (Let mee see, what then? Saint Dennis bee
13 3876 my speede) Donc vostre est Fraunce, & vous estes mienne.
13 3877 It is as easie for me, Kate, to conquer the Kingdome, as to
13 3878 speake so much more French: I shall neuer moue thee in
13 3879 French, vnlesse it be to laugh at me
13 3880 
13 3881    Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il
13 3882 & melieus que l' Anglois le quel Ie parle
13 3883 
13 3884    King. No faith is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of
13 3885 my Tongue, and I thine, most truely falsely, must
13 3886 needes be graunted to be much at one. But Kate, doo'st
13 3887 thou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue
13 3888 mee?
13 3889   Kath. I cannot tell
13 3890 
13 3891    King. Can any of your Neighbours tell, Kate? Ile
13 3892 aske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night,
13 3893 when you come into your Closet, you'le question this
13 3894 Gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
13 3895 her disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your
13 3896 heart: but good Kate, mocke me mercifully, the rather
13 3897 gentle Princesse, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou
13 3898 beest mine, Kate, as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells
13 3899 me thou shalt; I get thee with skambling, and thou
13 3900 must therefore needes proue a good Souldier-breeder:
13 3901 Shall not thou and I, betweene Saint Dennis and Saint
13 3902 George, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English,
13 3903 that shall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by
13 3904 the Beard. Shall wee not? what say'st thou, my faire
13 3905 Flower-de-Luce
13 3906 
13 3907    Kate. I doe not know dat
13 3908 
13 3909    King. No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise:
13 3910 doe but now promise Kate, you will endeauour for your
13 3911 French part of such a Boy; and for my English moytie,
13 3912 take the Word of a King, and a Batcheler. How answer
13 3913 you. La plus belle Katherine du monde mon trescher & deuin
13 3914 deesse
13 3915 
13 3916    Kath. Your Maiestee aue fause Frenche enough to
13 3917 deceiue de most sage Damoiseil dat is en Fraunce
13 3918 
13 3919    King. Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor
13 3920 in true English, I loue thee Kate; by which Honor, I dare
13 3921 not sweare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flatter
13 3922 me, that thou doo'st; notwithstanding the poore and
13 3923 vntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my
13 3924 Fathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres
13 3925 when hee got me, therefore was I created with a stubborne
13 3926 out-side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come
13 3927 to wooe Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith Kate, the elder
13 3928 I wax, the better I shall appeare. My comfort is, that
13 3929 Old Age, that ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more
13 3930 spoyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at
13 3931 the worst; and thou shalt weare me, if thou weare me,
13 3932 better and better: and therefore tell me, most faire Katherine,
13 3933 will you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes,
13 3934 auouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of
13 3935 an Empresse, take me by the Hand, and say, Harry of
13 3936 England, I am thine: which Word thou shalt no sooner
13 3937 blesse mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, England
13 3938 is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry
13 3939 Plantaginet is thine; who, though I speake it before his
13 3940 Face, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou shalt
13 3941 finde the best King of Good-fellowes. Come your Answer
13 3942 in broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and
13 3943 thy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, Katherine,
13 3944 breake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou
13 3945 haue me?
13 3946   Kath. Dat is as it shall please de Roy mon pere
13 3947 
13 3948    King. Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please
13 3949 him, Kate
13 3950 
13 3951    Kath. Den it sall also content me
13 3952 
13 3953    King. Vpon that I kisse your Hand, and I call you my
13 3954 Queene
13 3955 
13 3956    Kath. Laisse mon Seigneur, laisse, laisse, may foy: Ie ne
13 3957 veus point que vous abbaisse vostre grandeus, en baisant le
13 3958 main d' une nostre Seigneur indignie seruiteur excuse moy. Ie
13 3959 vous supplie mon tres-puissant Seigneur
13 3960 
13 3961    King. Then I will kisse your Lippes, Kate
13 3962 
13 3963    Kath. Les Dames & Damoisels pour estre baisee deuant
13 3964 leur nopcese il net pas le costume de Fraunce
13 3965 
13 3966    King. Madame, my Interpreter, what sayes shee?
13 3967   Lady. Dat it is not be de fashon pour le Ladies of
13 3968 Fraunce; I cannot tell wat is buisse en Anglish
13 3969 
13 3970    King. To kisse
13 3971 
13 3972    Lady. Your Maiestee entendre bettre que moy
13 3973 
13 3974    King. It is not a fashion for the Maids in Fraunce to
13 3975 kisse before they are marryed, would she say?
13 3976   Lady. Ouy verayment
13 3977 
13 3978    King. O Kate, nice Customes cursie to great Kings.
13 3979 Deare Kate, you and I cannot bee confin'd within the
13 3980 weake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the makers
13 3981 of Manners, Kate; and the libertie that followes
13 3982 our Places, stoppes the mouth of all finde-faults, as I
13 3983 will doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your
13 3984 Countrey, in denying me a Kisse: therefore patiently,
13 3985 and yeelding. You haue Witch-craft in your Lippes,
13 3986 Kate: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of
13 3987 them, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and
13 3988 they should sooner perswade Harry of England, then a
13 3989 generall Petition of Monarchs. Heere comes your
13 3990 Father.
13 3991 Enter the French Power, and the English Lords.
13 3992 
13 3993   Burg. God saue your Maiestie, my Royall Cousin,
13 3994 teach you our Princesse English?
13 3995   King. I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how
13 3996 perfectly I loue her, and that is good English
13 3997 
13 3998    Burg. Is shee not apt?
13 3999   King. Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Condition
13 4000 is not smooth: so that hauing neyther the Voyce nor
13 4001 the Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot so coniure vp
13 4002 the Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true
13 4003 likenesse
13 4004 
13 4005    Burg. Pardon the franknesse of my mirth, if I answer
13 4006 you for that. If you would coniure in her, you must
13 4007 make a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true
13 4008 likenesse, hee must appeare naked, and blinde. Can you
13 4009 blame her then, being a Maid, yet ros'd ouer with the
13 4010 Virgin Crimson of Modestie, if shee deny the apparance
13 4011 of a naked blinde Boy in her naked seeing selfe? It were
13 4012 (my Lord) a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne
13 4013 to
13 4014 
13 4015    King. Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind
13 4016 and enforces
13 4017 
13 4018    Burg. They are then excus'd, my Lord, when they see
13 4019 not what they doe
13 4020 
13 4021    King. Then good my Lord, teach your Cousin to
13 4022 consent winking
13 4023 
13 4024    Burg. I will winke on her to consent, my Lord, if you
13 4025 will teach her to know my meaning: for Maides well
13 4026 Summer'd, and warme kept, are like Flyes at Bartholomew-tyde,
13 4027 blinde, though they haue their eyes, and then
13 4028 they will endure handling, which before would not abide
13 4029 looking on
13 4030 
13 4031    King. This Morall tyes me ouer to Time, and a hot
13 4032 Summer; and so I shall catch the Flye, your Cousin, in
13 4033 the latter end, and she must be blinde to
13 4034 
13 4035    Burg. As Loue is my Lord, before it loues
13 4036 
13 4037    King. It is so: and you may, some of you, thanke
13 4038 Loue for my blindnesse, who cannot see many a faire
13 4039 French Citie for one faire French Maid that stands in my
13 4040 way
13 4041 
13 4042    French King. Yes my Lord, you see them perspectiuely:
13 4043 the Cities turn'd into a Maid; for they are
13 4044 all gyrdled with Maiden Walls, that Warre hath entred
13 4045 
13 4046    England. Shall Kate be my Wife?
13 4047   France. So please you
13 4048 
13 4049    England. I am content, so the Maiden Cities you
13 4050 talke of, may wait on her: so the Maid that stood in
13 4051 the way for my Wish, shall shew me the way to my
13 4052 Will
13 4053 
13 4054    France. Wee haue consented to all tearmes of reason
13 4055 
13 4056    England. Is't so, my Lords of England?
13 4057   West. The King hath graunted euery Article:
13 4058 His Daughter first; and in sequele, all,
13 4059 According to their firme proposed natures
13 4060 
13 4061    Exet. Onely he hath not yet subscribed this:
13 4062 Where your Maiestie demands, That the King of France
13 4063 hauing any occasion to write for matter of Graunt, shall
13 4064 name your Highnesse in this forme, and with this addition,
13 4065 in French: Nostre trescher filz Henry Roy d' Angleterre
13 4066 Heretere de Fraunce: and thus in Latine; Praeclarissimus
13 4067 Filius noster Henricus Rex Angliæ & Heres Franciae
13 4068 
13 4069    France. Nor this I haue not Brother so deny'd,
13 4070 But your request shall make me let it passe
13 4071 
13 4072    England. I pray you then, in loue and deare allyance,
13 4073 Let that one Article ranke with the rest,
13 4074 And thereupon giue me your Daughter
13 4075 
13 4076    France. Take her faire Sonne, and from her blood rayse vp
13 4077 Issue to me, that the contending Kingdomes
13 4078 Of France and England, whose very shoares looke pale,
13 4079 With enuy of each others happinesse,
13 4080 May cease their hatred; and this deare Coniunction
13 4081 Plant Neighbour-hood and Christian-like accord
13 4082 In their sweet Bosomes: that neuer Warre aduance
13 4083 His bleeding Sword 'twixt England and faire France
13 4084 
13 4085    Lords. Amen
13 4086 
13 4087    King. Now welcome Kate: and beare me witnesse all,
13 4088 That here I kisse her as my Soueraigne Queene.
13 4089 
13 4090 Flourish.
13 4091 
13 4092   Quee. God, the best maker of all Marriages,
13 4093 Combine your hearts in one, your Realmes in one:
13 4094 As Man and Wife being two, are one in loue,
13 4095 So be there 'twixt your Kingdomes such a Spousall,
13 4096 That neuer may ill Office, or fell Iealousie,
13 4097 Which troubles oft the Bed of blessed Marriage,
13 4098 Thrust in betweene the Paction of these Kingdomes,
13 4099 To make diuorce of their incorporate League:
13 4100 That English may as French, French Englishmen,
13 4101 Receiue each other. God speake this Amen
13 4102 
13 4103    All. Amen
13 4104 
13 4105    King. Prepare we for our Marriage: on which day,
13 4106 My Lord of Burgundy wee'le take your Oath
13 4107 And all the Peeres, for suretie of our Leagues.
13 4108 Then shall I sweare to Kate, and you to me,
13 4109 And may our Oathes well kept and prosp'rous be.
13 4110 
13 4111 Senet. Exeunt.
13 4112 
13 4113 Enter Chorus.
13 4114 
13 4115 Thus farre with rough, and all-vnable Pen,
13 4116 Our bending Author hath pursu'd the Story,
13 4117 In little roome confining mightie men,
13 4118 Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
13 4119 Small time: but in that small, most greatly liued
13 4120 This Starre of England. Fortune made his Sword;
13 4121 By which, the Worlds best Garden he atchieued:
13 4122 And of it left his Sonne Imperiall Lord.
13 4123 Henry the Sixt, in Infant Bands crown'd King
13 4124 Of France and England, did this King succeed:
13 4125 Whose State so many had the managing,
13 4126 That they lost France, and made his England bleed:
13 4127 Which oft our Stage hath showne; and for their sake,
13 4128 In your faire minds let this acceptance take.
