1 45 
1 46 [Francisco at his post. Enter to him Bernardo.]
1 47 
1 48 Ber.
1 49 Who's there?
1 50 
1 51 Fran.
1 52 Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
1 53 
1 54 Ber.
1 55 Long live the king!
1 56 
1 57 Fran.
1 58 Bernardo?
1 59 
1 60 Ber.
1 61 He.
1 62 
1 63 Fran.
1 64 You come most carefully upon your hour.
1 65 
1 66 Ber.
1 67 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
1 68 
1 69 Fran.
1 70 For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
1 71 And I am sick at heart.
1 72 
1 73 Ber.
1 74 Have you had quiet guard?
1 75 
1 76 Fran.
1 77 Not a mouse stirring.
1 78 
1 79 Ber.
1 80 Well, good night.
1 81 If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
1 82 The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
1 83 
1 84 Fran.
1 85 I think I hear them.--Stand, ho! Who is there?
1 86 
1 87 [Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
1 88 
1 89 Hor.
1 90 Friends to this ground.
1 91 
1 92 Mar.
1 93 And liegemen to the Dane.
1 94 
1 95 Fran.
1 96 Give you good-night.
1 97 
1 98 Mar.
1 99 O, farewell, honest soldier;
1 100 Who hath reliev'd you?
1 101 
1 102 Fran.
1 103 Bernardo has my place.
1 104 Give you good-night.
1 105 
1 106 [Exit.]
1 107 
1 108 Mar.
1 109 Holla! Bernardo!
1 110 
1 111 Ber.
1 112 Say.
1 113 What, is Horatio there?
1 114 
1 115 Hor.
1 116 A piece of him.
1 117 
1 118 Ber.
1 119 Welcome, Horatio:--Welcome, good Marcellus.
1 120 
1 121 Mar.
1 122 What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
1 123 
1 124 Ber.
1 125 I have seen nothing.
1 126 
1 127 Mar.
1 128 Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
1 129 And will not let belief take hold of him
1 130 Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
1 131 Therefore I have entreated him along
1 132 With us to watch the minutes of this night;
1 133 That, if again this apparition come
1 134 He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
1 135 
1 136 Hor.
1 137 Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
1 138 
1 139 Ber.
1 140 Sit down awhile,
1 141 And let us once again assail your ears,
1 142 That are so fortified against our story,
1 143 What we two nights have seen.
1 144 
1 145 Hor.
1 146 Well, sit we down,
1 147 And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
1 148 
1 149 Ber.
1 150 Last night of all,
1 151 When yond same star that's westward from the pole
1 152 Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
1 153 Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
1 154 The bell then beating one,--
1 155 
1 156 Mar.
1 157 Peace, break thee off; look where it comes again!
1 158 
1 159 [Enter Ghost, armed.]
1 160 
1 161 Ber.
1 162 In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
1 163 
1 164 Mar.
1 165 Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
1 166 
1 167 Ber.
1 168 Looks it not like the King? mark it, Horatio.
1 169 
1 170 Hor.
1 171 Most like:--it harrows me with fear and wonder.
1 172 
1 173 Ber.
1 174 It would be spoke to.
1 175 
1 176 Mar.
1 177 Question it, Horatio.
1 178 
1 179 Hor.
1 180 What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,
1 181 Together with that fair and warlike form
1 182 In which the majesty of buried Denmark
1 183 Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!
1 184 
1 185 Mar.
1 186 It is offended.
1 187 
1 188 Ber.
1 189 See, it stalks away!
1 190 
1 191 Hor.
1 192 Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
1 193 
1 194 [Exit Ghost.]
1 195 
1 196 Mar.
1 197 'Tis gone, and will not answer.
1 198 
1 199 Ber.
1 200 How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:
1 201 Is not this something more than fantasy?
1 202 What think you on't?
1 203 
1 204 Hor.
1 205 Before my God, I might not this believe
1 206 Without the sensible and true avouch
1 207 Of mine own eyes.
1 208 
1 209 Mar.
1 210 Is it not like the King?
1 211 
1 212 Hor.
1 213 As thou art to thyself:
1 214 Such was the very armour he had on
1 215 When he the ambitious Norway combated;
1 216 So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
1 217 He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
1 218 'Tis strange.
1 219 
1 220 Mar.
1 221 Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
1 222 With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
1 223 
1 224 Hor.
1 225 In what particular thought to work I know not;
1 226 But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
1 227 This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
1 228 
1 229 Mar.
1 230 Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
1 231 Why this same strict and most observant watch
1 232 So nightly toils the subject of the land;
1 233 And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
1 234 And foreign mart for implements of war;
1 235 Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
1 236 Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
1 237 What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
1 238 Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
1 239 Who is't that can inform me?
1 240 
1 241 Hor.
1 242 That can I;
1 243 At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
1 244 Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
1 245 Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
1 246 Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
1 247 Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,--
1 248 For so this side of our known world esteem'd him,--
1 249 Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
1 250 Well ratified by law and heraldry,
1 251 Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,
1 252 Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:
1 253 Against the which, a moiety competent
1 254 Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
1 255 To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
1 256 Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant,
1 257 And carriage of the article design'd,
1 258 His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
1 259 Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
1 260 Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
1 261 Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
1 262 For food and diet, to some enterprise
1 263 That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,--
1 264 As it doth well appear unto our state,--
1 265 But to recover of us, by strong hand,
1 266 And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
1 267 So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
1 268 Is the main motive of our preparations,
1 269 The source of this our watch, and the chief head
1 270 Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
1 271 
1 272 Ber.
1 273 I think it be no other but e'en so:
1 274 Well may it sort, that this portentous figure
1 275 Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
1 276 That was and is the question of these wars.
1 277 
1 278 Hor.
1 279 A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
1 280 In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
1 281 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
1 282 The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
1 283 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
1 284 As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
1 285 Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,
1 286 Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
1 287 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
1 288 And even the like precurse of fierce events,--
1 289 As harbingers preceding still the fates,
1 290 And prologue to the omen coming on,--
1 291 Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
1 292 Unto our climature and countrymen.--
1 293 But, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
1 294 
1 295 [Re-enter Ghost.]
1 296 
1 297 I'll cross it, though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!
1 298 If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
1 299 Speak to me:
1 300 If there be any good thing to be done,
1 301 That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
1 302 Speak to me:
1 303 If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
1 304 Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
1 305 O, speak!
1 306 Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
1 307 Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
1 308 For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
1 309 [The cock crows.]
1 310 Speak of it:--stay, and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus!
1 311 
1 312 Mar.
1 313 Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
1 314 
1 315 Hor.
1 316 Do, if it will not stand.
1 317 
1 318 Ber.
1 319 'Tis here!
1 320 
1 321 Hor.
1 322 'Tis here!
1 323 
1 324 Mar.
1 325 'Tis gone!
1 326 
1 327 [Exit Ghost.]
1 328 
1 329 We do it wrong, being so majestical,
1 330 To offer it the show of violence;
1 331 For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
1 332 And our vain blows malicious mockery.
1 333 
1 334 Ber.
1 335 It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
1 336 
1 337 Hor.
1 338 And then it started, like a guilty thing
1 339 Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
1 340 The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
1 341 Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
1 342 Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
1 343 Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
1 344 The extravagant and erring spirit hies
1 345 To his confine: and of the truth herein
1 346 This present object made probation.
1 347 
1 348 Mar.
1 349 It faded on the crowing of the cock.
1 350 Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
1 351 Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
1 352 The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
1 353 And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
1 354 The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
1 355 No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;
1 356 So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
1 357 
1 358 Hor.
1 359 So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
1 360 But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
1 361 Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
1 362 Break we our watch up: and by my advice,
1 363 Let us impart what we have seen to-night
1 364 Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
1 365 This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:
1 366 Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
1 367 As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
1 368 
1 369 Mar.
1 370 Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
1 371 Where we shall find him most conveniently.
1 372 
1 373 [Exeunt.]
1 374 
1 375 
1 376 
1 377 Scene II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
1 378 
1 379 [Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand,
1 380 Cornelius, Lords, and Attendant.]
1 381 
1 382 King.
1 383 Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
1 384 The memory be green, and that it us befitted
1 385 To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
1 386 To be contracted in one brow of woe;
1 387 Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
1 388 That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
1 389 Together with remembrance of ourselves.
1 390 Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
1 391 Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
1 392 Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
1 393 With an auspicious and one dropping eye,
1 394 With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
1 395 In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
1 396 Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
1 397 Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
1 398 With this affair along:--or all, our thanks.
1 399 Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
1 400 Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
1 401 Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
1 402 Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
1 403 Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
1 404 He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
1 405 Importing the surrender of those lands
1 406 Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
1 407 To our most valiant brother. So much for him,--
1 408 Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
1 409 Thus much the business is:--we have here writ
1 410 To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
1 411 Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
1 412 Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
1 413 His further gait herein; in that the levies,
1 414 The lists, and full proportions are all made
1 415 Out of his subject:--and we here dispatch
1 416 You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
1 417 For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
1 418 Giving to you no further personal power
1 419 To business with the king, more than the scope
1 420 Of these dilated articles allow.
1 421 Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.
1 422 
1 423 Cor. and Volt.
1 424 In that and all things will we show our duty.
1 425 
1 426 King.
1 427 We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
1 428 
1 429 [Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]
1 430 
1 431 And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
1 432 You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
1 433 You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
1 434 And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
1 435 That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
1 436 The head is not more native to the heart,
1 437 The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
1 438 Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
1 439 What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
1 440 
1 441 Laer.
1 442 Dread my lord,
1 443 Your leave and favour to return to France;
1 444 From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
1 445 To show my duty in your coronation;
1 446 Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
1 447 My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
1 448 And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
1 449 
1 450 King.
1 451 Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
1 452 
1 453 Pol.
1 454 He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
1 455 By laboursome petition; and at last
1 456 Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
1 457 I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
1 458 
1 459 King.
1 460 Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
1 461 And thy best graces spend it at thy will!--
1 462 But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son--
1 463 
1 464 Ham.
1 465 [Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
1 466 
1 467 King.
1 468 How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
1 469 
1 470 Ham.
1 471 Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
1 472 
1 473 Queen.
1 474 Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
1 475 And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
1 476 Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
1 477 Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
1 478 Thou know'st 'tis common,--all that lives must die,
1 479 Passing through nature to eternity.
1 480 
1 481 Ham.
1 482 Ay, madam, it is common.
1 483 
1 484 Queen.
1 485 If it be,
1 486 Why seems it so particular with thee?
1 487 
1 488 Ham.
1 489 Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.
1 490 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
1 491 Nor customary suits of solemn black,
1 492 Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
1 493 No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
1 494 Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
1 495 Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,
1 496 That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;
1 497 For they are actions that a man might play;
1 498 But I have that within which passeth show;
1 499 These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
1 500 
1 501 King.
1 502 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
1 503 To give these mourning duties to your father;
1 504 But, you must know, your father lost a father;
1 505 That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,
1 506 In filial obligation, for some term
1 507 To do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere
1 508 In obstinate condolement is a course
1 509 Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
1 510 It shows a will most incorrect to heaven;
1 511 A heart unfortified, a mind impatient;
1 512 An understanding simple and unschool'd;
1 513 For what we know must be, and is as common
1 514 As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
1 515 Why should we, in our peevish opposition,
1 516 Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
1 517 A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
1 518 To reason most absurd; whose common theme
1 519 Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
1 520 From the first corse till he that died to-day,
1 521 'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
1 522 This unprevailing woe; and think of us
1 523 As of a father: for let the world take note
1 524 You are the most immediate to our throne;
1 525 And with no less nobility of love
1 526 Than that which dearest father bears his son
1 527 Do I impart toward you. For your intent
1 528 In going back to school in Wittenberg,
1 529 It is most retrograde to our desire:
1 530 And we beseech you bend you to remain
1 531 Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
1 532 Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
1 533 
1 534 Queen.
1 535 Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
1 536 I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
1 537 
1 538 Ham.
1 539 I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
1 540 
1 541 King.
1 542 Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
1 543 Be as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come;
1 544 This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
1 545 Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
1 546 No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
1 547 But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;
1 548 And the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
1 549 Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
1 550 
1 551 [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
1 552 
1 553 Ham.
1 554 O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
1 555 Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
1 556 Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
1 557 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!
1 558 How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
1 559 Seem to me all the uses of this world!
1 560 Fie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
1 561 That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
1 562 Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
1 563 But two months dead!--nay, not so much, not two:
1 564 So excellent a king; that was, to this,
1 565 Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,
1 566 That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
1 567 Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
1 568 Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
1 569 As if increase of appetite had grown
1 570 By what it fed on: and yet, within a month,--
1 571 Let me not think on't,--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
1 572 A little month; or ere those shoes were old
1 573 With which she followed my poor father's body
1 574 Like Niobe, all tears;--why she, even she,--
1 575 O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,
1 576 Would have mourn'd longer,--married with mine uncle,
1 577 My father's brother; but no more like my father
1 578 Than I to Hercules: within a month;
1 579 Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
1 580 Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
1 581 She married:-- O, most wicked speed, to post
1 582 With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
1 583 It is not, nor it cannot come to good;
1 584 But break my heart,--for I must hold my tongue!
1 585 
1 586 [Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]
1 587 
1 588 Hor.
1 589 Hail to your lordship!
1 590 
1 591 Ham.
1 592 I am glad to see you well:
1 593 Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
1 594 
1 595 Hor.
1 596 The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
1 597 
1 598 Ham.
1 599 Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
1 600 And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--
1 601 Marcellus?
1 602 
1 603 Mar.
1 604 My good lord,--
1 605 
1 606 Ham.
1 607 I am very glad to see you.--Good even, sir.--
1 608 But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
1 609 
1 610 Hor.
1 611 A truant disposition, good my lord.
1 612 
1 613 Ham.
1 614 I would not hear your enemy say so;
1 615 Nor shall you do my ear that violence,
1 616 To make it truster of your own report
1 617 Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
1 618 But what is your affair in Elsinore?
1 619 We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
1 620 
1 621 Hor.
1 622 My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
1 623 
1 624 Ham.
1 625 I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
1 626 I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
1 627 
1 628 Hor.
1 629 Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
1 630 
1 631 Ham.
1 632 Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
1 633 Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
1 634 Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
1 635 Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!--
1 636 My father,--methinks I see my father.
1 637 
1 638 Hor.
1 639 Where, my lord?
1 640 
1 641 Ham.
1 642 In my mind's eye, Horatio.
1 643 
1 644 Hor.
1 645 I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
1 646 
1 647 Ham.
1 648 He was a man, take him for all in all,
1 649 I shall not look upon his like again.
1 650 
1 651 Hor.
1 652 My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
1 653 
1 654 Ham.
1 655 Saw who?
1 656 
1 657 Hor.
1 658 My lord, the king your father.
1 659 
1 660 Ham.
1 661 The King my father!
1 662 
1 663 Hor.
1 664 Season your admiration for awhile
1 665 With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
1 666 Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
1 667 This marvel to you.
1 668 
1 669 Ham.
1 670 For God's love let me hear.
1 671 
1 672 Hor.
1 673 Two nights together had these gentlemen,
1 674 Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch
1 675 In the dead vast and middle of the night,
1 676 Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
1 677 Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
1 678 Appears before them and with solemn march
1 679 Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
1 680 By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
1 681 Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
1 682 Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
1 683 Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me
1 684 In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
1 685 And I with them the third night kept the watch:
1 686 Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
1 687 Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
1 688 The apparition comes: I knew your father;
1 689 These hands are not more like.
1 690 
1 691 Ham.
1 692 But where was this?
1 693 
1 694 Mar.
1 695 My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
1 696 
1 697 Ham.
1 698 Did you not speak to it?
1 699 
1 700 Hor.
1 701 My lord, I did;
1 702 But answer made it none: yet once methought
1 703 It lifted up it head, and did address
1 704 Itself to motion, like as it would speak:
1 705 But even then the morning cock crew loud,
1 706 And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
1 707 And vanish'd from our sight.
1 708 
1 709 Ham.
1 710 'Tis very strange.
1 711 
1 712 Hor.
1 713 As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
1 714 And we did think it writ down in our duty
1 715 To let you know of it.
1 716 
1 717 Ham.
1 718 Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
1 719 Hold you the watch to-night?
1 720 
1 721 Mar. and Ber.
1 722 We do, my lord.
1 723 
1 724 Ham.
1 725 Arm'd, say you?
1 726 
1 727 Both.
1 728 Arm'd, my lord.
1 729 
1 730 Ham.
1 731 From top to toe?
1 732 
1 733 Both.
1 734 My lord, from head to foot.
1 735 
1 736 Ham.
1 737 Then saw you not his face?
1 738 
1 739 Hor.
1 740 O, yes, my lord: he wore his beaver up.
1 741 
1 742 Ham.
1 743 What, look'd he frowningly?
1 744 
1 745 Hor.
1 746 A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
1 747 
1 748 Ham.
1 749 Pale or red?
1 750 
1 751 Hor.
1 752 Nay, very pale.
1 753 
1 754 Ham.
1 755 And fix'd his eyes upon you?
1 756 
1 757 Hor.
1 758 Most constantly.
1 759 
1 760 Ham.
1 761 I would I had been there.
1 762 
1 763 Hor.
1 764 It would have much amaz'd you.
1 765 
1 766 Ham.
1 767 Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
1 768 
1 769 Hor.
1 770 While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
1 771 
1 772 Mar. and Ber.
1 773 Longer, longer.
1 774 
1 775 Hor.
1 776 Not when I saw't.
1 777 
1 778 Ham.
1 779 His beard was grizzled,--no?
1 780 
1 781 Hor.
1 782 It was, as I have seen it in his life,
1 783 A sable silver'd.
1 784 
1 785 Ham.
1 786 I will watch to-night;
1 787 Perchance 'twill walk again.
1 788 
1 789 Hor.
1 790 I warr'nt it will.
1 791 
1 792 Ham.
1 793 If it assume my noble father's person,
1 794 I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
1 795 And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
1 796 If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
1 797 Let it be tenable in your silence still;
1 798 And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
1 799 Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
1 800 I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well:
1 801 Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
1 802 I'll visit you.
1 803 
1 804 All.
1 805 Our duty to your honour.
1 806 
1 807 Ham.
1 808 Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
1 809 
1 810 [Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]
1 811 
1 812 My father's spirit in arms! All is not well;
1 813 I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
1 814 Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
1 815 Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
1 816 
1 817 [Exit.]

1 821 Scene III. A room in Polonius's house.
1 822 
1 823 [Enter Laertes and Ophelia.]
1 824 
1 825 Laer.
1 826 My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
1 827 And, sister, as the winds give benefit
1 828 And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
1 829 But let me hear from you.
1 830 
1 831 Oph.
1 832 Do you doubt that?
1 833 
1 834 Laer.
1 835 For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
1 836 Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood:
1 837 A violet in the youth of primy nature,
1 838 Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;
1 839 The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
1 840 No more.
1 841 
1 842 Oph.
1 843 No more but so?
1 844 
1 845 Laer.
1 846 Think it no more:
1 847 For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
1 848 In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
1 849 The inward service of the mind and soul
1 850 Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now;
1 851 And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
1 852 The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
1 853 His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
1 854 For he himself is subject to his birth:
1 855 He may not, as unvalu'd persons do,
1 856 Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
1 857 The safety and health of this whole state;
1 858 And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
1 859 Unto the voice and yielding of that body
1 860 Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
1 861 It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
1 862 As he in his particular act and place
1 863 May give his saying deed; which is no further
1 864 Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
1 865 Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
1 866 If with too credent ear you list his songs,
1 867 Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
1 868 To his unmaster'd importunity.
1 869 Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
1 870 And keep you in the rear of your affection,
1 871 Out of the shot and danger of desire.
1 872 The chariest maid is prodigal enough
1 873 If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
1 874 Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:
1 875 The canker galls the infants of the spring
1 876 Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd:
1 877 And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
1 878 Contagious blastments are most imminent.
1 879 Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
1 880 Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
1 881 
1 882 Oph.
1 883 I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
1 884 As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
1 885 Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
1 886 Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
1 887 Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
1 888 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
1 889 And recks not his own read.
1 890 
1 891 Laer.
1 892 O, fear me not.
1 893 I stay too long:--but here my father comes.
1 894 
1 895 [Enter Polonius.]
1 896 
1 897 A double blessing is a double grace;
1 898 Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
1 899 
1 900 Pol.
1 901 Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
1 902 The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
1 903 And you are stay'd for. There,--my blessing with thee!
1 904 
1 905 [Laying his hand on Laertes's head.]
1 906 
1 907 And these few precepts in thy memory
1 908 Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
1 909 Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
1 910 Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
1 911 Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
1 912 Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
1 913 But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
1 914 Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
1 915 Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,
1 916 Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
1 917 Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
1 918 Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
1 919 Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
1 920 But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
1 921 For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
1 922 And they in France of the best rank and station
1 923 Are most select and generous chief in that.
1 924 Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
1 925 For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
1 926 And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
1 927 This above all,--to thine own self be true;
1 928 And it must follow, as the night the day,
1 929 Thou canst not then be false to any man.
1 930 Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
1 931 
1 932 Laer.
1 933 Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
1 934 
1 935 Pol.
1 936 The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
1 937 
1 938 Laer.
1 939 Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
1 940 What I have said to you.
1 941 
1 942 Oph.
1 943 'Tis in my memory lock'd,
1 944 And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
1 945 
1 946 Laer.
1 947 Farewell.
1 948 
1 949 [Exit.]
1 950 
1 951 Pol.
1 952 What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
1 953 
1 954 Oph.
1 955 So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
1 956 
1 957 Pol.
1 958 Marry, well bethought:
1 959 'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
1 960 Given private time to you; and you yourself
1 961 Have of your audience been most free and bounteous;
1 962 If it be so,--as so 'tis put on me,
1 963 And that in way of caution,--I must tell you
1 964 You do not understand yourself so clearly
1 965 As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
1 966 What is between you? give me up the truth.
1 967 
1 968 Oph.
1 969 He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
1 970 Of his affection to me.
1 971 
1 972 Pol.
1 973 Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
1 974 Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
1 975 Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
1 976 
1 977 Oph.
1 978 I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
1 979 
1 980 Pol.
1 981 Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
1 982 That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
1 983 Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
1 984 Or,--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
1 985 Wronging it thus,--you'll tender me a fool.
1 986 
1 987 Oph.
1 988 My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
1 989 In honourable fashion.
1 990 
1 991 Pol.
1 992 Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
1 993 
1 994 Oph.
1 995 And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
1 996 With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
1 997 
1 998 Pol.
1 999 Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
1 1000 When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
1 1001 Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
1 1002 Giving more light than heat,--extinct in both,
1 1003 Even in their promise, as it is a-making,--
1 1004 You must not take for fire. From this time
1 1005 Be something scanter of your maiden presence;
1 1006 Set your entreatments at a higher rate
1 1007 Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
1 1008 Believe so much in him, that he is young;
1 1009 And with a larger tether may he walk
1 1010 Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
1 1011 Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,--
1 1012 Not of that dye which their investments show,
1 1013 But mere implorators of unholy suits,
1 1014 Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
1 1015 The better to beguile. This is for all,--
1 1016 I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
1 1017 Have you so slander any moment leisure
1 1018 As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
1 1019 Look to't, I charge you; come your ways.
1 1020 
1 1021 Oph.
1 1022 I shall obey, my lord.
1 1023 
1 1024 [Exeunt.]

1 1027 
1 1028 Scene IV. The platform.
1 1029 
1 1030 [Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]
1 1031 
1 1032 Ham.
1 1033 The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
1 1034 
1 1035 Hor.
1 1036 It is a nipping and an eager air.
1 1037 
1 1038 Ham.
1 1039 What hour now?
1 1040 
1 1041 Hor.
1 1042 I think it lacks of twelve.
1 1043 
1 1044 Mar.
1 1045 No, it is struck.
1 1046 
1 1047 Hor.
1 1048 Indeed? I heard it not: then draws near the season
1 1049 Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
1 1050 
1 1051 [A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within.]
1 1052 
1 1053 What does this mean, my lord?
1 1054 
1 1055 Ham.
1 1056 The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
1 1057 Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
1 1058 And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
1 1059 The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
1 1060 The triumph of his pledge.
1 1061 
1 1062 Hor.
1 1063 Is it a custom?
1 1064 
1 1065 Ham.
1 1066 Ay, marry, is't;
1 1067 But to my mind,--though I am native here,
1 1068 And to the manner born,--it is a custom
1 1069 More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
1 1070 This heavy-headed revel east and west
1 1071 Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations:
1 1072 They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
1 1073 Soil our addition; and, indeed, it takes
1 1074 From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
1 1075 The pith and marrow of our attribute.
1 1076 So oft it chances in particular men
1 1077 That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
1 1078 As in their birth,--wherein they are not guilty,
1 1079 Since nature cannot choose his origin,--
1 1080 By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
1 1081 Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;
1 1082 Or by some habit, that too much o'er-leavens
1 1083 The form of plausive manners;--that these men,--
1 1084 Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
1 1085 Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
1 1086 Their virtues else,--be they as pure as grace,
1 1087 As infinite as man may undergo,--
1 1088 Shall in the general censure take corruption
1 1089 From that particular fault: the dram of eale
1 1090 Doth all the noble substance often doubt
1 1091 To his own scandal.
1 1092 
1 1093 Hor.
1 1094 Look, my lord, it comes!
1 1095 
1 1096 [Enter Ghost.]
1 1097 
1 1098 Ham.
1 1099 Angels and ministers of grace defend us!--
1 1100 Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
1 1101 Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
1 1102 Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
1 1103 Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
1 1104 That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
1 1105 King, father, royal Dane; O, answer me!
1 1106 Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
1 1107 Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
1 1108 Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
1 1109 Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
1 1110 Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
1 1111 To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
1 1112 That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
1 1113 Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
1 1114 Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
1 1115 So horridly to shake our disposition
1 1116 With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
1 1117 Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
1 1118 
1 1119 [Ghost beckons Hamlet.]
1 1120 
1 1121 Hor.
1 1122 It beckons you to go away with it,
1 1123 As if it some impartment did desire
1 1124 To you alone.
1 1125 
1 1126 Mar.
1 1127 Look with what courteous action
1 1128 It waves you to a more removed ground:
1 1129 But do not go with it!
1 1130 
1 1131 Hor.
1 1132 No, by no means.
1 1133 
1 1134 Ham.
1 1135 It will not speak; then will I follow it.
1 1136 
1 1137 Hor.
1 1138 Do not, my lord.
1 1139 
1 1140 Ham.
1 1141 Why, what should be the fear?
1 1142 I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
1 1143 And for my soul, what can it do to that,
1 1144 Being a thing immortal as itself?
1 1145 It waves me forth again;--I'll follow it.
1 1146 
1 1147 Hor.
1 1148 What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
1 1149 Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
1 1150 That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
1 1151 And there assume some other horrible form
1 1152 Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,
1 1153 And draw you into madness? think of it:
1 1154 The very place puts toys of desperation,
1 1155 Without more motive, into every brain
1 1156 That looks so many fadoms to the sea
1 1157 And hears it roar beneath.
1 1158 
1 1159 Ham.
1 1160 It waves me still.--
1 1161 Go on; I'll follow thee.
1 1162 
1 1163 Mar.
1 1164 You shall not go, my lord.
1 1165 
1 1166 Ham.
1 1167 Hold off your hands.
1 1168 
1 1169 Hor.
1 1170 Be rul'd; you shall not go.
1 1171 
1 1172 Ham.
1 1173 My fate cries out,
1 1174 And makes each petty artery in this body
1 1175 As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.--
1 1176 
1 1177 [Ghost beckons.]
1 1178 
1 1179 Still am I call'd;--unhand me, gentlemen;--
1 1180 
1 1181 [Breaking free from them.]
1 1182 
1 1183 By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!--
1 1184 I say, away!--Go on; I'll follow thee.
1 1185 
1 1186 [Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.]
1 1187 
1 1188 Hor.
1 1189 He waxes desperate with imagination.
1 1190 
1 1191 Mar.
1 1192 Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
1 1193 
1 1194 Hor.
1 1195 Have after.--To what issue will this come?
1 1196 
1 1197 Mar.
1 1198 Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
1 1199 
1 1200 Hor.
1 1201 Heaven will direct it.
1 1202 
1 1203 Mar.
1 1204 Nay, let's follow him.
1 1205 
1 1206 [Exeunt.]
1 1207 
1 1208 
1 1209 
1 1210 Scene V. A more remote part of the Castle.
1 1211 
1 1212 [Enter Ghost and Hamlet.]
1 1213 
1 1214 Ham.
1 1215 Whither wilt thou lead me? speak! I'll go no further.
1 1216 
1 1217 Ghost.
1 1218 Mark me.
1 1219 
1 1220 Ham.
1 1221 I will.
1 1222 
1 1223 Ghost.
1 1224 My hour is almost come,
1 1225 When I to sulph'uous and tormenting flames
1 1226 Must render up myself.
1 1227 
1 1228 Ham.
1 1229 Alas, poor ghost!
1 1230 
1 1231 Ghost.
1 1232 Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
1 1233 To what I shall unfold.
1 1234 
1 1235 Ham.
1 1236 Speak; I am bound to hear.
1 1237 
1 1238 Ghost.
1 1239 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
1 1240 
1 1241 Ham.
1 1242 What?
1 1243 
1 1244 Ghost.
1 1245 I am thy father's spirit;
1 1246 Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
1 1247 And for the day confin'd to wastein fires,
1 1248 Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
1 1249 Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
1 1250 To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
1 1251 I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
1 1252 Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
1 1253 Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
1 1254 Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
1 1255 And each particular hair to stand on end
1 1256 Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:
1 1257 But this eternal blazon must not be
1 1258 To ears of flesh and blood.--List, list, O, list!--
1 1259 If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
1 1260 
1 1261 Ham.
1 1262 O God!
1 1263 
1 1264 Ghost.
1 1265 Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
1 1266 
1 1267 Ham.
1 1268 Murder!
1 1269 
1 1270 Ghost.
1 1271 Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
1 1272 But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
1 1273 
1 1274 Ham.
1 1275 Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
1 1276 As meditation or the thoughts of love,
1 1277 May sweep to my revenge.
1 1278 
1 1279 Ghost.
1 1280 I find thee apt;
1 1281 And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
1 1282 That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
1 1283 Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
1 1284 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
1 1285 A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
1 1286 Is by a forged process of my death
1 1287 Rankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,
1 1288 The serpent that did sting thy father's life
1 1289 Now wears his crown.
1 1290 
1 1291 Ham.
1 1292 O my prophetic soul!
1 1293 Mine uncle!
1 1294 
1 1295 Ghost.
1 1296 Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
1 1297 With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
1 1298 O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
1 1299 So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
1 1300 The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
1 1301 O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
1 1302 From me, whose love was of that dignity
1 1303 That it went hand in hand even with the vow
1 1304 I made to her in marriage; and to decline
1 1305 Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
1 1306 To those of mine!
1 1307 But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
1 1308 Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;
1 1309 So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
1 1310 Will sate itself in a celestial bed
1 1311 And prey on garbage.
1 1312 But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
1 1313 Brief let me be.--Sleeping within my orchard,
1 1314 My custom always of the afternoon,
1 1315 Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
1 1316 With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
1 1317 And in the porches of my ears did pour
1 1318 The leperous distilment; whose effect
1 1319 Holds such an enmity with blood of man
1 1320 That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
1 1321 The natural gates and alleys of the body;
1 1322 And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
1 1323 And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
1 1324 The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;
1 1325 And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
1 1326 Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
1 1327 All my smooth body.
1 1328 Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,
1 1329 Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
1 1330 Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
1 1331 Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;
1 1332 No reckoning made, but sent to my account
1 1333 With all my imperfections on my head:
1 1334 O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
1 1335 If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
1 1336 Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
1 1337 A couch for luxury and damned incest.
1 1338 But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,
1 1339 Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
1 1340 Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,
1 1341 And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
1 1342 To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
1 1343 The glowworm shows the matin to be near,
1 1344 And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
1 1345 Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
1 1346 
1 1347 [Exit.]
1 1348 
1 1349 Ham.
1 1350 O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
1 1351 And shall I couple hell? O, fie!--Hold, my heart;
1 1352 And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
1 1353 But bear me stiffly up.--Remember thee!
1 1354 Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
1 1355 In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
1 1356 Yea, from the table of my memory
1 1357 I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
1 1358 All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
1 1359 That youth and observation copied there;
1 1360 And thy commandment all alone shall live
1 1361 Within the book and volume of my brain,
1 1362 Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!--
1 1363 O most pernicious woman!
1 1364 O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
1 1365 My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
1 1366 That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
1 1367 At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark:
1 1368 
1 1369 [Writing.]
1 1370 
1 1371 So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
1 1372 It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me:'
1 1373 I have sworn't.
1 1374 
1 1375 Hor.
1 1376 [Within.] My lord, my lord,--
1 1377 
1 1378 Mar.
1 1379 [Within.] Lord Hamlet,--
1 1380 
1 1381 Hor.
1 1382 [Within.] Heaven secure him!
1 1383 
1 1384 Ham.
1 1385 So be it!
1 1386 
1 1387 Mar.
1 1388 [Within.] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
1 1389 
1 1390 Ham.
1 1391 Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
1 1392 
1 1393 [Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
1 1394 
1 1395 Mar.
1 1396 How is't, my noble lord?
1 1397 
1 1398 Hor.
1 1399 What news, my lord?
1 1400 
1 1401 Ham.
1 1402 O, wonderful!
1 1403 
1 1404 Hor.
1 1405 Good my lord, tell it.
1 1406 
1 1407 Ham.
1 1408 No; you'll reveal it.
1 1409 
1 1410 Hor.
1 1411 Not I, my lord, by heaven.
1 1412 
1 1413 Mar.
1 1414 Nor I, my lord.
1 1415 
1 1416 Ham.
1 1417 How say you then; would heart of man once think it?--
1 1418 But you'll be secret?
1 1419 
1 1420 Hor. and Mar.
1 1421 Ay, by heaven, my lord.
1 1422 
1 1423 Ham.
1 1424 There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
1 1425 But he's an arrant knave.
1 1426 
1 1427 Hor.
1 1428 There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
1 1429 To tell us this.
1 1430 
1 1431 Ham.
1 1432 Why, right; you are i' the right;
1 1433 And so, without more circumstance at all,
1 1434 I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
1 1435 You, as your business and desires shall point you,--
1 1436 For every man hath business and desire,
1 1437 Such as it is;--and for my own poor part,
1 1438 Look you, I'll go pray.
1 1439 
1 1440 Hor.
1 1441 These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
1 1442 
1 1443 Ham.
1 1444 I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
1 1445 Yes, faith, heartily.
1 1446 
1 1447 Hor.
1 1448 There's no offence, my lord.
1 1449 
1 1450 Ham.
1 1451 Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
1 1452 And much offence too. Touching this vision here,--
1 1453 It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
1 1454 For your desire to know what is between us,
1 1455 O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
1 1456 As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
1 1457 Give me one poor request.
1 1458 
1 1459 Hor.
1 1460 What is't, my lord? we will.
1 1461 
1 1462 Ham.
1 1463 Never make known what you have seen to-night.
1 1464 
1 1465 Hor. and Mar.
1 1466 My lord, we will not.
1 1467 
1 1468 Ham.
1 1469 Nay, but swear't.
1 1470 
1 1471 Hor.
1 1472 In faith,
1 1473 My lord, not I.
1 1474 
1 1475 Mar.
1 1476 Nor I, my lord, in faith.
1 1477 
1 1478 Ham.
1 1479 Upon my sword.
1 1480 
1 1481 Mar.
1 1482 We have sworn, my lord, already.
1 1483 
1 1484 Ham.
1 1485 Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
1 1486 
1 1487 Ghost.
1 1488 [Beneath.] Swear.
1 1489 
1 1490 Ham.
1 1491 Ha, ha boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny?--
1 1492 Come on!--you hear this fellow in the cellarage,--
1 1493 Consent to swear.
1 1494 
1 1495 Hor.
1 1496 Propose the oath, my lord.
1 1497 
1 1498 Ham.
1 1499 Never to speak of this that you have seen,
1 1500 Swear by my sword.
1 1501 
1 1502 Ghost.
1 1503 [Beneath.] Swear.
1 1504 
1 1505 Ham.
1 1506 Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.--
1 1507 Come hither, gentlemen,
1 1508 And lay your hands again upon my sword:
1 1509 Never to speak of this that you have heard,
1 1510 Swear by my sword.
1 1511 
1 1512 Ghost.
1 1513 [Beneath.] Swear.
1 1514 
1 1515 Ham.
1 1516 Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
1 1517 A worthy pioner!--Once more remove, good friends.
1 1518 
1 1519 Hor.
1 1520 O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
1 1521 
1 1522 Ham.
1 1523 And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
1 1524 There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
1 1525 Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
1 1526 But come;--
1 1527 Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
1 1528 How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,--
1 1529 As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
1 1530 To put an antic disposition on,--
1 1531 That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
1 1532 With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,
1 1533 Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
1 1534 As 'Well, well, we know'; or 'We could, an if we would';--
1 1535 Or 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be, an if they might';--
1 1536 Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
1 1537 That you know aught of me:--this is not to do,
1 1538 So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
1 1539 Swear.
1 1540 
1 1541 Ghost.
1 1542 [Beneath.] Swear.
1 1543 
1 1544 Ham.
1 1545 Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!--So, gentlemen,
1 1546 With all my love I do commend me to you:
1 1547 And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
1 1548 May do, to express his love and friending to you,
1 1549 God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
1 1550 And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
1 1551 The time is out of joint:--O cursed spite,
1 1552 That ever I was born to set it right!--
1 1553 Nay, come, let's go together.

1 1559 Act II.
1 1560 
1 1561 Scene I. A room in Polonius's house.
1 1562 
1 1563 [Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.]
1 1564 
1 1565 Pol.
1 1566 Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
1 1567 
1 1568 Rey.
1 1569 I will, my lord.
1 1570 
1 1571 Pol.
1 1572 You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
1 1573 Before You visit him, to make inquiry
1 1574 Of his behaviour.
1 1575 
1 1576 Rey.
1 1577 My lord, I did intend it.
1 1578 
1 1579 Pol.
1 1580 Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
1 1581 Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
1 1582 And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
1 1583 What company, at what expense; and finding,
1 1584 By this encompassment and drift of question,
1 1585 That they do know my son, come you more nearer
1 1586 Than your particular demands will touch it:
1 1587 Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
1 1588 As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
1 1589 And in part him;--do you mark this, Reynaldo?
1 1590 
1 1591 Rey.
1 1592 Ay, very well, my lord.
1 1593 
1 1594 Pol.
1 1595 'And in part him;--but,' you may say, 'not well:
1 1596 But if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
1 1597 Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
1 1598 What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
1 1599 As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
1 1600 But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
1 1601 As are companions noted and most known
1 1602 To youth and liberty.
1 1603 
1 1604 Rey.
1 1605 As gaming, my lord.
1 1606 
1 1607 Pol.
1 1608 Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
1 1609 Drabbing:--you may go so far.
1 1610 
1 1611 Rey.
1 1612 My lord, that would dishonour him.
1 1613 
1 1614 Pol.
1 1615 Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
1 1616 You must not put another scandal on him,
1 1617 That he is open to incontinency;
1 1618 That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
1 1619 That they may seem the taints of liberty;
1 1620 The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind;
1 1621 A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
1 1622 Of general assault.
1 1623 
1 1624 Rey.
1 1625 But, my good lord,--
1 1626 
1 1627 Pol.
1 1628 Wherefore should you do this?
1 1629 
1 1630 Rey.
1 1631 Ay, my lord,
1 1632 I would know that.
1 1633 
1 1634 Pol.
1 1635 Marry, sir, here's my drift;
1 1636 And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
1 1637 You laying these slight sullies on my son
1 1638 As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
1 1639 Mark you,
1 1640 Your party in converse, him you would sound,
1 1641 Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
1 1642 The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
1 1643 He closes with you in this consequence;
1 1644 'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'--
1 1645 According to the phrase or the addition
1 1646 Of man and country.
1 1647 
1 1648 Rey.
1 1649 Very good, my lord.
1 1650 
1 1651 Pol.
1 1652 And then, sir, does he this,--he does--What was I about to say?--
1 1653 By the mass, I was about to say something:--Where did I leave?
1 1654 
1 1655 Rey.
1 1656 At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
1 1657 gentleman.'
1 1658 
1 1659 Pol.
1 1660 At--closes in the consequence'--ay, marry!
1 1661 He closes with you thus:--'I know the gentleman;
1 1662 I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
1 1663 Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
1 1664 There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
1 1665 There falling out at tennis': or perchance,
1 1666 'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'--
1 1667 Videlicet, a brothel,--or so forth.--
1 1668 See you now;
1 1669 Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
1 1670 And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
1 1671 With windlaces, and with assays of bias,
1 1672 By indirections find directions out:
1 1673 So, by my former lecture and advice,
1 1674 Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
1 1675 
1 1676 Rey.
1 1677 My lord, I have.
1 1678 
1 1679 Pol.
1 1680 God b' wi' you, fare you well.
1 1681 
1 1682 Rey.
1 1683 Good my lord!
1 1684 
1 1685 Pol.
1 1686 Observe his inclination in yourself.
1 1687 
1 1688 Rey.
1 1689 I shall, my lord.
1 1690 
1 1691 Pol.
1 1692 And let him ply his music.
1 1693 
1 1694 Rey.
1 1695 Well, my lord.
1 1696 
1 1697 Pol.
1 1698 Farewell!
1 1699 
1 1700 [Exit Reynaldo.]
1 1701 
1 1702 [Enter Ophelia.]
1 1703 
1 1704 How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
1 1705 
1 1706 Oph.
1 1707 Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
1 1708 
1 1709 Pol.
1 1710 With what, i' the name of God?
1 1711 
1 1712 Oph.
1 1713 My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
1 1714 Lord Hamlet,--with his doublet all unbrac'd;
1 1715 No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
1 1716 Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
1 1717 Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
1 1718 And with a look so piteous in purport
1 1719 As if he had been loosed out of hell
1 1720 To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
1 1721 
1 1722 Pol.
1 1723 Mad for thy love?
1 1724 
1 1725 Oph.
1 1726 My lord, I do not know;
1 1727 But truly I do fear it.
1 1728 
1 1729 Pol.
1 1730 What said he?
1 1731 
1 1732 Oph.
1 1733 He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
1 1734 Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
1 1735 And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
1 1736 He falls to such perusal of my face
1 1737 As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
1 1738 At last,--a little shaking of mine arm,
1 1739 And thrice his head thus waving up and down,--
1 1740 He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
1 1741 As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
1 1742 And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
1 1743 And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd
1 1744 He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
1 1745 For out o' doors he went without their help,
1 1746 And to the last bended their light on me.
1 1747 
1 1748 Pol.
1 1749 Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
1 1750 This is the very ecstasy of love;
1 1751 Whose violent property fordoes itself,
1 1752 And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
1 1753 As oft as any passion under heaven
1 1754 That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,--
1 1755 What, have you given him any hard words of late?
1 1756 
1 1757 Oph.
1 1758 No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
1 1759 I did repel his letters and denied
1 1760 His access to me.
1 1761 
1 1762 Pol.
1 1763 That hath made him mad.
1 1764 I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
1 1765 I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
1 1766 And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
1 1767 It seems it as proper to our age
1 1768 To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
1 1769 As it is common for the younger sort
1 1770 To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
1 1771 This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
1 1772 More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
1 1773 
1 1774 [Exeunt.]

1 1777 
1 1778 Scene II. A room in the Castle.
1 1779 
1 1780 [Enter King, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants.]
1 1781 
1 1782 King.
1 1783 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
1 1784 Moreover that we much did long to see you,
1 1785 The need we have to use you did provoke
1 1786 Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
1 1787 Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,
1 1788 Since nor the exterior nor the inward man
1 1789 Resembles that it was. What it should be,
1 1790 More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
1 1791 So much from the understanding of himself,
1 1792 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both
1 1793 That, being of so young days brought up with him,
1 1794 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
1 1795 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
1 1796 Some little time: so by your companies
1 1797 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
1 1798 So much as from occasion you may glean,
1 1799 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
1 1800 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
1 1801 
1 1802 Queen.
1 1803 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
1 1804 And sure I am two men there are not living
1 1805 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
1 1806 To show us so much gentry and good-will
1 1807 As to expend your time with us awhile,
1 1808 For the supply and profit of our hope,
1 1809 Your visitation shall receive such thanks
1 1810 As fits a king's remembrance.
1 1811 
1 1812 Ros.
1 1813 Both your majesties
1 1814 Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
1 1815 Put your dread pleasures more into command
1 1816 Than to entreaty.
1 1817 
1 1818 Guil.
1 1819 We both obey,
1 1820 And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
1 1821 To lay our service freely at your feet,
1 1822 To be commanded.
1 1823 
1 1824 King.
1 1825 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
1 1826 
1 1827 Queen.
1 1828 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
1 1829 And I beseech you instantly to visit
1 1830 My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you,
1 1831 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
1 1832 
1 1833 Guil.
1 1834 Heavens make our presence and our practices
1 1835 Pleasant and helpful to him!
1 1836 
1 1837 Queen.
1 1838 Ay, amen!
1 1839 
1 1840 [Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants].
1 1841 
1 1842 [Enter Polonius.]
1 1843 
1 1844 Pol.
1 1845 Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
1 1846 Are joyfully return'd.
1 1847 
1 1848 King.
1 1849 Thou still hast been the father of good news.
1 1850 
1 1851 Pol.
1 1852 Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
1 1853 I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
1 1854 Both to my God and to my gracious king:
1 1855 And I do think,--or else this brain of mine
1 1856 Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
1 1857 As it hath us'd to do,--that I have found
1 1858 The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
1 1859 
1 1860 King.
1 1861 O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
1 1862 
1 1863 Pol.
1 1864 Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
1 1865 My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
1 1866 
1 1867 King.
1 1868 Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
1 1869 
1 1870 [Exit Polonius.]
1 1871 
1 1872 He tells me, my sweet queen, he hath found
1 1873 The head and source of all your son's distemper.
1 1874 
1 1875 Queen.
1 1876 I doubt it is no other but the main,--
1 1877 His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
1 1878 
1 1879 King.
1 1880 Well, we shall sift him.
1 1881 
1 1882 [Enter Polonius, with Voltimand and Cornelius.]
1 1883 
1 1884 Welcome, my good friends!
1 1885 Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
1 1886 
1 1887 Volt.
1 1888 Most fair return of greetings and desires.
1 1889 Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
1 1890 His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
1 1891 To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
1 1892 But, better look'd into, he truly found
1 1893 It was against your highness; whereat griev'd,--
1 1894 That so his sickness, age, and impotence
1 1895 Was falsely borne in hand,--sends out arrests
1 1896 On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
1 1897 Receives rebuke from Norway; and, in fine,
1 1898 Makes vow before his uncle never more
1 1899 To give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
1 1900 Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
1 1901 Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee;
1 1902 And his commission to employ those soldiers,
1 1903 So levied as before, against the Polack:
1 1904 With an entreaty, herein further shown,
1 1905 [Gives a paper.]
1 1906 That it might please you to give quiet pass
1 1907 Through your dominions for this enterprise,
1 1908 On such regards of safety and allowance
1 1909 As therein are set down.
1 1910 
1 1911 King.
1 1912 It likes us well;
1 1913 And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
1 1914 Answer, and think upon this business.
1 1915 Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
1 1916 Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
1 1917 Most welcome home!
1 1918 
1 1919 [Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]
1 1920 
1 1921 Pol.
1 1922 This business is well ended.--
1 1923 My liege, and madam,--to expostulate
1 1924 What majesty should be, what duty is,
1 1925 Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
1 1926 Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
1 1927 Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
1 1928 And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
1 1929 I will be brief:--your noble son is mad:
1 1930 Mad call I it; for to define true madness,
1 1931 What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
1 1932 But let that go.
1 1933 
1 1934 Queen.
1 1935 More matter, with less art.
1 1936 
1 1937 Pol.
1 1938 Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
1 1939 That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
1 1940 And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
1 1941 But farewell it, for I will use no art.
1 1942 Mad let us grant him then: and now remains
1 1943 That we find out the cause of this effect;
1 1944 Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
1 1945 For this effect defective comes by cause:
1 1946 Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
1 1947 Perpend.
1 1948 I have a daughter,--have whilst she is mine,--
1 1949 Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
1 1950 Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
1 1951 [Reads.]
1 1952 'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
1 1953 Ophelia,'--
1 1954 That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
1 1955 phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
1 1956 [Reads.]
1 1957 'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
1 1958 
1 1959 Queen.
1 1960 Came this from Hamlet to her?
1 1961 
1 1962 Pol.
1 1963 Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
1 1964 [Reads.]
1 1965   'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
1 1966      Doubt that the sun doth move;
1 1967    Doubt truth to be a liar;
1 1968      But never doubt I love.
1 1969 'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
1 1970 reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
1 1971 it. Adieu.
1 1972   'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
1 1973      HAMLET.'
1 1974 This, in obedience, hath my daughter show'd me;
1 1975 And more above, hath his solicitings,
1 1976 As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
1 1977 All given to mine ear.
1 1978 
1 1979 King.
1 1980 But how hath she
1 1981 Receiv'd his love?
1 1982 
1 1983 Pol.
1 1984 What do you think of me?
1 1985 
1 1986 King.
1 1987 As of a man faithful and honourable.
1 1988 
1 1989 Pol.
1 1990 I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
1 1991 When I had seen this hot love on the wing,--
1 1992 As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
1 1993 Before my daughter told me,-- what might you,
1 1994 Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
1 1995 If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
1 1996 Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;
1 1997 Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;--
1 1998 What might you think? No, I went round to work,
1 1999 And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
1 2000 'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;
1 2001 This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
1 2002 That she should lock herself from his resort,
1 2003 Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
1 2004 Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
1 2005 And he, repulsed,--a short tale to make,--
1 2006 Fell into a sadness; then into a fast;
1 2007 Thence to a watch; thence into a weakness;
1 2008 Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,
1 2009 Into the madness wherein now he raves,
1 2010 And all we wail for.
1 2011 
1 2012 King.
1 2013 Do you think 'tis this?
1 2014 
1 2015 Queen.
1 2016 It may be, very likely.
1 2017 
1 2018 Pol.
1 2019 Hath there been such a time,--I'd fain know that--
1 2020 That I have positively said ''Tis so,'
1 2021 When it prov'd otherwise?
1 2022 
1 2023 King.
1 2024 Not that I know.
1 2025 
1 2026 Pol.
1 2027 Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
1 2028 [Points to his head and shoulder.]
1 2029 If circumstances lead me, I will find
1 2030 Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
1 2031 Within the centre.
1 2032 
1 2033 King.
1 2034 How may we try it further?
1 2035 
1 2036 Pol.
1 2037 You know sometimes he walks for hours together
1 2038 Here in the lobby.
1 2039 
1 2040 Queen.
1 2041 So he does indeed.
1 2042 
1 2043 Pol.
1 2044 At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
1 2045 Be you and I behind an arras then;
1 2046 Mark the encounter: if he love her not,
1 2047 And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
1 2048 Let me be no assistant for a state,
1 2049 But keep a farm and carters.
1 2050 
1 2051 King.
1 2052 We will try it.
1 2053 
1 2054 Queen.
1 2055 But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
1 2056 
1 2057 Pol.
1 2058 Away, I do beseech you, both away
1 2059 I'll board him presently:--O, give me leave.
1 2060 
1 2061 [Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.]
1 2062 
1 2063 [Enter Hamlet, reading.]
1 2064 
1 2065 How does my good Lord Hamlet?
1 2066 
1 2067 Ham.
1 2068 Well, God-a-mercy.
1 2069 
1 2070 Pol.
1 2071 Do you know me, my lord?
1 2072 
1 2073 Ham.
1 2074 Excellent well; you're a fishmonger.
1 2075 
1 2076 Pol.
1 2077 Not I, my lord.
1 2078 
1 2079 Ham.
1 2080 Then I would you were so honest a man.
1 2081 
1 2082 Pol.
1 2083 Honest, my lord!
1 2084 
1 2085 Ham.
1 2086 Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
1 2087 picked out of ten thousand.
1 2088 
1 2089 Pol.
1 2090 That's very true, my lord.
1 2091 
1 2092 Ham.
1 2093 For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing
1 2094 carrion,--Have you a daughter?
1 2095 
1 2096 Pol.
1 2097 I have, my lord.
1 2098 
1 2099 Ham.
1 2100 Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing, but not
1 2101 as your daughter may conceive:--friend, look to't.
1 2102 
1 2103 Pol.
1 2104 How say you by that?--[Aside.] Still harping on my daughter:--yet
1 2105 he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far
1 2106 gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity
1 2107 for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.--What do you
1 2108 read, my lord?
1 2109 
1 2110 Ham.
1 2111 Words, words, words.
1 2112 
1 2113 Pol.
1 2114 What is the matter, my lord?
1 2115 
1 2116 Ham.
1 2117 Between who?
1 2118 
1 2119 Pol.
1 2120 I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
1 2121 
1 2122 Ham.
1 2123 Slanders, sir: for the satirical slave says here that old men
1 2124 have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
1 2125 purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
1 2126 plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which,
1 2127 sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
1 2128 not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
1 2129 should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.
1 2130 
1 2131 Pol.
1 2132 [Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.--
1 2133 Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
1 2134 
1 2135 Ham.
1 2136 Into my grave?
1 2137 
1 2138 Pol.
1 2139 Indeed, that is out o' the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes
1 2140 his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
1 2141 reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
1 2142 will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
1 2143 him and my daughter.--My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
1 2144 my leave of you.
1 2145 
1 2146 Ham.
1 2147 You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
1 2148 willingly part withal,--except my life, except my life, except my
1 2149 life.
1 2150 
1 2151 Pol.
1 2152 Fare you well, my lord.
1 2153 
1 2154 Ham.
1 2155 These tedious old fools!
1 2156 
1 2157 [Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
1 2158 
1 2159 Pol.
1 2160 You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
1 2161 
1 2162 Ros.
1 2163 [To Polonius.] God save you, sir!
1 2164 
1 2165 [Exit Polonius.]
1 2166 
1 2167 Guil.
1 2168 My honoured lord!
1 2169 
1 2170 Ros.
1 2171 My most dear lord!
1 2172 
1 2173 Ham.
1 2174 My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
1 2175 Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
1 2176 
1 2177 Ros.
1 2178 As the indifferent children of the earth.
1 2179 
1 2180 Guil.
1 2181 Happy in that we are not over-happy;
1 2182 On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
1 2183 
1 2184 Ham.
1 2185 Nor the soles of her shoe?
1 2186 
1 2187 Ros.
1 2188 Neither, my lord.
1 2189 
1 2190 Ham.
1 2191 Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
1 2192 favours?
1 2193 
1 2194 Guil.
1 2195 Faith, her privates we.
1 2196 
1 2197 Ham.
1 2198 In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a
1 2199 strumpet. What's the news?
1 2200 
1 2201 Ros.
1 2202 None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
1 2203 
1 2204 Ham.
1 2205 Then is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me
1 2206 question more in particular: what have you, my good friends,
1 2207 deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison
1 2208 hither?
1 2209 
1 2210 Guil.
1 2211 Prison, my lord!
1 2212 
1 2213 Ham.
1 2214 Denmark's a prison.
1 2215 
1 2216 Ros.
1 2217 Then is the world one.
1 2218 
1 2219 Ham.
1 2220 A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
1 2221 dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
1 2222 
1 2223 Ros.
1 2224 We think not so, my lord.
1 2225 
1 2226 Ham.
1 2227 Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
1 2228 or bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.
1 2229 
1 2230 Ros.
1 2231 Why, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your
1 2232 mind.
1 2233 
1 2234 Ham.
1 2235 O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a
1 2236 king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
1 2237 
1 2238 Guil.
1 2239 Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of
1 2240 the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
1 2241 
1 2242 Ham.
1 2243 A dream itself is but a shadow.
1 2244 
1 2245 Ros.
1 2246 Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
1 2247 it is but a shadow's shadow.
1 2248 
1 2249 Ham.
1 2250 Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
1 2251 heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my
1 2252 fay, I cannot reason.
1 2253 
1 2254 Ros. and Guild.
1 2255 We'll wait upon you.
1 2256 
1 2257 Ham.
1 2258 No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my
1 2259 servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
1 2260 dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what
1 2261 make you at Elsinore?
1 2262 
1 2263 Ros.
1 2264 To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
1 2265 
1 2266 Ham.
1 2267 Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:
1 2268 and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
1 2269 you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
1 2270 visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
1 2271 
1 2272 Guil.
1 2273 What should we say, my lord?
1 2274 
1 2275 Ham.
1 2276 Why, anything--but to the purpose. You were sent for; and
1 2277 there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
1 2278 have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen
1 2279 have sent for you.
1 2280 
1 2281 Ros.
1 2282 To what end, my lord?
1 2283 
1 2284 Ham.
1 2285 That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights
1 2286 of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
1 2287 obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
1 2288 better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
1 2289 me, whether you were sent for or no.
1 2290 
1 2291 Ros.
1 2292 [To Guildenstern.] What say you?
1 2293 
1 2294 Ham.
1 2295 [Aside.] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you love me, hold
1 2296 not off.
1 2297 
1 2298 Guil.
1 2299 My lord, we were sent for.
1 2300 
1 2301 Ham.
1 2302 I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
1 2303 discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
1 2304 feather. I have of late,--but wherefore I know not,--lost all my
1 2305 mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
1 2306 heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
1 2307 seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
1 2308 air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
1 2309 roof fretted with golden fire,--why, it appears no other thing
1 2310 to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
1 2311 piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in
1 2312 faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in
1 2313 action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the
1 2314 beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what
1 2315 is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman
1 2316 neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
1 2317 
1 2318 Ros.
1 2319 My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
1 2320 
1 2321 Ham.
1 2322 Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
1 2323 
1 2324 Ros.
1 2325 To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
1 2326 entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them
1 2327 on the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.
1 2328 
1 2329 Ham.
1 2330 He that plays the king shall be welcome,--his majesty shall
1 2331 have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
1 2332 target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
1 2333 end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
1 2334 lungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind
1 2335 freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
1 2336 they?
1 2337 
1 2338 Ros.
1 2339 Even those you were wont to take such delight in,--the
1 2340 tragedians of the city.
1 2341 
1 2342 Ham.
1 2343 How chances it they travel? their residence, both in
1 2344 reputation and profit, was better both ways.
1 2345 
1 2346 Ros.
1 2347 I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
1 2348 innovation.
1 2349 
1 2350 Ham.
1 2351 Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
1 2352 city? Are they so followed?
1 2353 
1 2354 Ros.
1 2355 No, indeed, are they not.
1 2356 
1 2357 Ham.
1 2358 How comes it? do they grow rusty?
1 2359 
1 2360 Ros.
1 2361 Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,
1 2362 sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
1 2363 of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are
1 2364 now the fashion; and so berattle the common stages,--so they call
1 2365 them,--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and
1 2366 dare scarce come thither.
1 2367 
1 2368 Ham.
1 2369 What, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they
1 2370 escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
1 2371 sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
1 2372 themselves to common players,--as it is most like, if their means
1 2373 are no better,--their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
1 2374 against their own succession?
1 2375 
1 2376 Ros.
1 2377 Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
1 2378 holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for
1 2379 awhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
1 2380 went to cuffs in the question.
1 2381 
1 2382 Ham.
1 2383 Is't possible?
1 2384 
1 2385 Guil.
1 2386 O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
1 2387 
1 2388 Ham.
1 2389 Do the boys carry it away?
1 2390 
1 2391 Ros.
1 2392 Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
1 2393 
1 2394 Ham.
1 2395 It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and
1 2396 those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give
1 2397 twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in
1 2398 little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
1 2399 philosophy could find it out.
1 2400 
1 2401 [Flourish of trumpets within.]
1 2402 
1 2403 Guil.
1 2404 There are the players.
1 2405 
1 2406 Ham.
1 2407 Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come: the
1 2408 appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply
1 2409 with you in this garb; lest my extent to the players, which I
1 2410 tell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like
1 2411 entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father
1 2412 and aunt-mother are deceived.
1 2413 
1 2414 Guil.
1 2415 In what, my dear lord?
1 2416 
1 2417 Ham.
1 2418 I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I
1 2419 know a hawk from a handsaw.
1 2420 
1 2421 [Enter Polonius.]
1 2422 
1 2423 Pol.
1 2424 Well be with you, gentlemen!
1 2425 
1 2426 Ham.
1 2427 Hark you, Guildenstern;--and you too;--at each ear a hearer: that
1 2428 great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
1 2429 
1 2430 Ros.
1 2431 Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
1 2432 man is twice a child.
1 2433 
1 2434 Ham.
1 2435 I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.--You
1 2436 say right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.
1 2437 
1 2438 Pol.
1 2439 My lord, I have news to tell you.
1 2440 
1 2441 Ham.
1 2442 My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
1 2443 Rome,--
1 2444 
1 2445 Pol.
1 2446 The actors are come hither, my lord.
1 2447 
1 2448 Ham.
1 2449 Buzz, buzz!
1 2450 
1 2451 Pol.
1 2452 Upon my honour,--
1 2453 
1 2454 Ham.
1 2455 Then came each actor on his ass,--
1 2456 
1 2457 Pol.
1 2458 The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
1 2459 history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
1 2460 tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene
1 2461 individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor
1 2462 Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
1 2463 the only men.
1 2464 
1 2465 Ham.
1 2466 O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
1 2467 
1 2468 Pol.
1 2469 What treasure had he, my lord?
1 2470 
1 2471 Ham.
1 2472 Why--
1 2473    'One fair daughter, and no more,
1 2474    The which he loved passing well.'
1 2475 
1 2476 
1 2477 Pol.
1 2478 [Aside.] Still on my daughter.
1 2479 
1 2480 Ham.
1 2481 Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
1 2482 
1 2483 Pol.
1 2484 If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
1 2485 love passing well.
1 2486 
1 2487 Ham.
1 2488 Nay, that follows not.
1 2489 
1 2490 Pol.
1 2491 What follows, then, my lord?
1 2492 
1 2493 Ham.
1 2494 Why--
1 2495    'As by lot, God wot,'
1 2496 and then, you know,
1 2497    'It came to pass, as most like it was--'
1 2498 The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
1 2499 where my abridgment comes.
1 2500 
1 2501 [Enter four or five Players.]
1 2502 
1 2503 You are welcome, masters; welcome, all:--I am glad to see thee
1 2504 well.--welcome, good friends.--O, my old friend! Thy face is
1 2505 valanc'd since I saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in
1 2506 Denmark?--What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your
1 2507 ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
1 2508 altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of
1 2509 uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.--Masters, you are
1 2510 all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
1 2511 anything we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a
1 2512 taste of your quality: come, a passionate speech.
1 2513 
1 2514 I Play.
1 2515 What speech, my lord?
1 2516 
1 2517 Ham.
1 2518 I heard thee speak me a speech once,--but it was never acted;
1 2519 or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased
1 2520 not the million, 'twas caviare to the general; but it was,--as I
1 2521 received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
1 2522 the top of mine,--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
1 2523 set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said
1 2524 there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
1 2525 nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of
1 2526 affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as
1 2527 sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it
1 2528 I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
1 2529 especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in
1 2530 your memory, begin at this line;--let me see, let me see:--
1 2531 
1 2532 The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,--
1 2533 
1 2534 it is not so:-- it begins with Pyrrhus:--
1 2535 
1 2536   'The rugged Pyrrhus,--he whose sable arms,
1 2537    Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
1 2538    When he lay couched in the ominous horse,--
1 2539    Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
1 2540    With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
1 2541    Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
1 2542    With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
1 2543    Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
1 2544    That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
1 2545    To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,
1 2546    And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
1 2547    With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
1 2548    Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
1 2549 
1 2550 So, proceed you.
1 2551 
1 2552 Pol.
1 2553 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
1 2554 discretion.
1 2555 
1 2556 I Play.
1 2557    Anon he finds him,
1 2558    Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,
1 2559    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
1 2560    Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
1 2561    Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
1 2562    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
1 2563    The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
1 2564    Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
1 2565    Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash
1 2566    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,
1 2567    Which was declining on the milky head
1 2568    Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
1 2569    So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;
1 2570    And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
1 2571    Did nothing.
1 2572    But as we often see, against some storm,
1 2573    A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
1 2574    The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
1 2575    As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
1 2576    Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
1 2577    A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;
1 2578    And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
1 2579    On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
1 2580    With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
1 2581    Now falls on Priam.--
1 2582    Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
1 2583    In general synod, take away her power;
1 2584    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
1 2585    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
1 2586    As low as to the fiends!
1 2587 
1 2588 Pol.
1 2589 This is too long.
1 2590 
1 2591 Ham.
1 2592 It shall to the barber's, with your beard.--Pr'ythee say on.--
1 2593 He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps:--say on; come
1 2594 to Hecuba.
1 2595 
1 2596 I Play.
1 2597    But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,--
1 2598 
1 2599 Ham.
1 2600 'The mobled queen'?
1 2601 
1 2602 Pol.
1 2603 That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
1 2604 
1 2605 I Play.
1 2606    Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
1 2607    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
1 2608    Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
1 2609    About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
1 2610    A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;--
1 2611    Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
1 2612    'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:
1 2613    But if the gods themselves did see her then,
1 2614    When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
1 2615    In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
1 2616    The instant burst of clamour that she made,--
1 2617    Unless things mortal move them not at all,--
1 2618    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
1 2619    And passion in the gods.
1 2620 
1 2621 Pol.
1 2622 Look, whether he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
1 2623 eyes.--Pray you, no more!
1 2624 
1 2625 Ham.
1 2626 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.--
1 2627 Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you
1 2628 hear? Let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief
1 2629 chronicles of the time; after your death you were better have a
1 2630 bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
1 2631 
1 2632 Pol.
1 2633 My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
1 2634 
1 2635 Ham.
1 2636 Odd's bodikin, man, better: use every man after his
1 2637 desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own
1 2638 honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in
1 2639 your bounty. Take them in.
1 2640 
1 2641 Pol.
1 2642 Come, sirs.
1 2643 
1 2644 Ham.
1 2645 Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
1 2646 
1 2647 [Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First.]
1 2648 
1 2649 Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murder of
1 2650 Gonzago'?
1 2651 
1 2652 I Play.
1 2653 Ay, my lord.
1 2654 
1 2655 Ham.
1 2656 We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
1 2657 speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
1 2658 insert in't? could you not?
1 2659 
1 2660 I Play.
1 2661 Ay, my lord.
1 2662 
1 2663 Ham.
1 2664 Very well.--Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.
1 2665 
1 2666 [Exit First Player.]
1 2667 
1 2668 --My good friends [to Ros. and Guild.], I'll leave you till
1 2669 night: you are welcome to Elsinore.
1 2670 
1 2671 Ros.
1 2672 Good my lord!
1 2673 
1 2674 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
1 2675 
1 2676 Ham.
1 2677 Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
1 2678 Now I am alone.
1 2679 O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
1 2680 Is it not monstrous that this player here,
1 2681 But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
1 2682 Could force his soul so to his own conceit
1 2683 That from her working all his visage wan'd;
1 2684 Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
1 2685 A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
1 2686 With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
1 2687 For Hecuba?
1 2688 What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
1 2689 That he should weep for her? What would he do,
1 2690 Had he the motive and the cue for passion
1 2691 That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
1 2692 And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
1 2693 Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;
1 2694 Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,
1 2695 The very faculties of eyes and ears.
1 2696 Yet I,
1 2697 A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
1 2698 Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
1 2699 And can say nothing; no, not for a king
1 2700 Upon whose property and most dear life
1 2701 A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
1 2702 Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
1 2703 Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
1 2704 Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat
1 2705 As deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?
1 2706 'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
1 2707 But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
1 2708 To make oppression bitter; or ere this
1 2709 I should have fatted all the region kites
1 2710 With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
1 2711 Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
1 2712 O, vengeance!
1 2713 Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
1 2714 That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
1 2715 Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
1 2716 Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words
1 2717 And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
1 2718 A scullion!
1 2719 Fie upon't! foh!--About, my brain! I have heard
1 2720 That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
1 2721 Have by the very cunning of the scene
1 2722 Been struck so to the soul that presently
1 2723 They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
1 2724 For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
1 2725 With most miraculous organ, I'll have these players
1 2726 Play something like the murder of my father
1 2727 Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
1 2728 I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
1 2729 I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
1 2730 May be the devil: and the devil hath power
1 2731 To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
1 2732 Out of my weakness and my melancholy,--
1 2733 As he is very potent with such spirits,--
1 2734 Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
1 2735 More relative than this.--the play's the thing
1 2736 Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

1 2743 ACT III.
1 2744 
1 2745 Scene I. A room in the Castle.
1 2746 
1 2747 [Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and
1 2748 Guildenstern.]
1 2749 
1 2750 King.
1 2751 And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
1 2752 Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
1 2753 Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
1 2754 With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
1 2755 
1 2756 Ros.
1 2757 He does confess he feels himself distracted,
1 2758 But from what cause he will by no means speak.
1 2759 
1 2760 Guil.
1 2761 Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
1 2762 But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof
1 2763 When we would bring him on to some confession
1 2764 Of his true state.
1 2765 
1 2766 Queen.
1 2767 Did he receive you well?
1 2768 
1 2769 Ros.
1 2770 Most like a gentleman.
1 2771 
1 2772 Guil.
1 2773 But with much forcing of his disposition.
1 2774 
1 2775 Ros.
1 2776 Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
1 2777 Most free in his reply.
1 2778 
1 2779 Queen.
1 2780 Did you assay him
1 2781 To any pastime?
1 2782 
1 2783 Ros.
1 2784 Madam, it so fell out that certain players
1 2785 We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,
1 2786 And there did seem in him a kind of joy
1 2787 To hear of it: they are about the court,
1 2788 And, as I think, they have already order
1 2789 This night to play before him.
1 2790 
1 2791 Pol.
1 2792 'Tis most true;
1 2793 And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
1 2794 To hear and see the matter.
1 2795 
1 2796 King.
1 2797 With all my heart; and it doth much content me
1 2798 To hear him so inclin'd.--
1 2799 Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
1 2800 And drive his purpose on to these delights.
1 2801 
1 2802 Ros.
1 2803 We shall, my lord.
1 2804 
1 2805 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
1 2806 
1 2807 King.
1 2808 Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
1 2809 For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
1 2810 That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
1 2811 Affront Ophelia:
1 2812 Her father and myself,--lawful espials,--
1 2813 Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
1 2814 We may of their encounter frankly judge;
1 2815 And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
1 2816 If't be the affliction of his love or no
1 2817 That thus he suffers for.
1 2818 
1 2819 Queen.
1 2820 I shall obey you:--
1 2821 And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
1 2822 That your good beauties be the happy cause
1 2823 Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
1 2824 Will bring him to his wonted way again,
1 2825 To both your honours.
1 2826 
1 2827 Oph.
1 2828 Madam, I wish it may.
1 2829 
1 2830 [Exit Queen.]
1 2831 
1 2832 Pol.
1 2833 Ophelia, walk you here.--Gracious, so please you,
1 2834 We will bestow ourselves.--[To Ophelia.] Read on this book;
1 2835 That show of such an exercise may colour
1 2836 Your loneliness.--We are oft to blame in this,--
1 2837 'Tis too much prov'd,--that with devotion's visage
1 2838 And pious action we do sugar o'er
1 2839 The Devil himself.
1 2840 
1 2841 King.
1 2842 [Aside.] O, 'tis too true!
1 2843 How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
1 2844 The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
1 2845 Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
1 2846 Than is my deed to my most painted word:
1 2847 O heavy burden!
1 2848 
1 2849 Pol.
1 2850 I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
1 2851 
1 2852 [Exeunt King and Polonius.]
1 2853 
1 2854 [Enter Hamlet.]
1 2855 
1 2856 Ham.
1 2857 To be, or not to be,--that is the question:--
1 2858 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
1 2859 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
1 2860 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
1 2861 And by opposing end them?--To die,--to sleep,--
1 2862 No more; and by a sleep to say we end
1 2863 The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
1 2864 That flesh is heir to,--'tis a consummation
1 2865 Devoutly to be wish'd. To die,--to sleep;--
1 2866 To sleep! perchance to dream:--ay, there's the rub;
1 2867 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
1 2868 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
1 2869 Must give us pause: there's the respect
1 2870 That makes calamity of so long life;
1 2871 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
1 2872 The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
1 2873 The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
1 2874 The insolence of office, and the spurns
1 2875 That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
1 2876 When he himself might his quietus make
1 2877 With a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,
1 2878 To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
1 2879 But that the dread of something after death,--
1 2880 The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
1 2881 No traveller returns,--puzzles the will,
1 2882 And makes us rather bear those ills we have
1 2883 Than fly to others that we know not of?
1 2884 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
1 2885 And thus the native hue of resolution
1 2886 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
1 2887 And enterprises of great pith and moment,
1 2888 With this regard, their currents turn awry,
1 2889 And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
1 2890 The fair Ophelia!--Nymph, in thy orisons
1 2891 Be all my sins remember'd.
1 2892 
1 2893 Oph.
1 2894 Good my lord,
1 2895 How does your honour for this many a day?
1 2896 
1 2897 Ham.
1 2898 I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
1 2899 
1 2900 Oph.
1 2901 My lord, I have remembrances of yours
1 2902 That I have longed long to re-deliver.
1 2903 I pray you, now receive them.
1 2904 
1 2905 Ham.
1 2906 No, not I;
1 2907 I never gave you aught.
1 2908 
1 2909 Oph.
1 2910 My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
1 2911 And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
1 2912 As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
1 2913 Take these again; for to the noble mind
1 2914 Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
1 2915 There, my lord.
1 2916 
1 2917 Ham.
1 2918 Ha, ha! are you honest?
1 2919 
1 2920 Oph.
1 2921 My lord?
1 2922 
1 2923 Ham.
1 2924 Are you fair?
1 2925 
1 2926 Oph.
1 2927 What means your lordship?
1 2928 
1 2929 Ham.
1 2930 That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
1 2931 discourse to your beauty.
1 2932 
1 2933 Oph.
1 2934 Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
1 2935 
1 2936 Ham.
1 2937 Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
1 2938 honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
1 2939 translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox,
1 2940 but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
1 2941 
1 2942 Oph.
1 2943 Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
1 2944 
1 2945 Ham.
1 2946 You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
1 2947 inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you
1 2948 not.
1 2949 
1 2950 Oph.
1 2951 I was the more deceived.
1 2952 
1 2953 Ham.
1 2954 Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of
1 2955 sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse
1 2956 me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me:
1 2957 I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
1 2958 beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
1 2959 them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
1 2960 do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all;
1 2961 believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
1 2962 father?
1 2963 
1 2964 Oph.
1 2965 At home, my lord.
1 2966 
1 2967 Ham.
1 2968 Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
1 2969 nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
1 2970 
1 2971 Oph.
1 2972 O, help him, you sweet heavens!
1 2973 
1 2974 Ham.
1 2975 If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry,--
1 2976 be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
1 2977 calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt
1 2978 needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
1 2979 monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
1 2980 Farewell.
1 2981 
1 2982 Oph.
1 2983 O heavenly powers, restore him!
1 2984 
1 2985 Ham.
1 2986 I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath
1 2987 given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you
1 2988 amble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your
1 2989 wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made
1 2990 me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are
1 2991 married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as
1 2992 they are. To a nunnery, go.
1 2993 
1 2994 [Exit.]
1 2995 
1 2996 Oph.
1 2997 O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
1 2998 The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
1 2999 The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
1 3000 The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
1 3001 The observ'd of all observers,--quite, quite down!
1 3002 And I, of ladies most deject and wretched
1 3003 That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
1 3004 Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
1 3005 Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
1 3006 That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
1 3007 Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
1 3008 To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
1 3009 
1 3010 [Re-enter King and Polonius.]
1 3011 
1 3012 King.
1 3013 Love! his affections do not that way tend;
1 3014 Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
1 3015 Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
1 3016 O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
1 3017 And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
1 3018 Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
1 3019 I have in quick determination
1 3020 Thus set it down:--he shall with speed to England
1 3021 For the demand of our neglected tribute:
1 3022 Haply the seas, and countries different,
1 3023 With variable objects, shall expel
1 3024 This something-settled matter in his heart;
1 3025 Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
1 3026 From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
1 3027 
1 3028 Pol.
1 3029 It shall do well: but yet do I believe
1 3030 The origin and commencement of his grief
1 3031 Sprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia!
1 3032 You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
1 3033 We heard it all.--My lord, do as you please;
1 3034 But if you hold it fit, after the play,
1 3035 Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
1 3036 To show his grief: let her be round with him;
1 3037 And I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear
1 3038 Of all their conference. If she find him not,
1 3039 To England send him; or confine him where
1 3040 Your wisdom best shall think.
1 3041 
1 3042 King.
1 3043 It shall be so:
1 3044 Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
1 3045

1 3049 
1 3050 Scene II. A hall in the Castle.
1 3051 
1 3052 [Enter Hamlet and certain Players.]
1 3053 
1 3054 Ham.
1 3055 Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
1 3056 trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your
1 3057 players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
1 3058 not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
1 3059 gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
1 3060 whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a
1 3061 temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
1 3062 soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
1 3063 tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who,
1 3064 for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
1 3065 shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing
1 3066 Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.
1 3067 
1 3068 I Player.
1 3069 I warrant your honour.
1 3070 
1 3071 Ham.
1 3072 Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
1 3073 tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
1 3074 this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
1 3075 nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
1 3076 whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
1 3077 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,
1 3078 scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
1 3079 form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though
1 3080 it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
1 3081 grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,
1 3082 o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
1 3083 have seen play,--and heard others praise, and that highly,--not
1 3084 to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of
1 3085 Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
1 3086 strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's
1 3087 journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
1 3088 humanity so abominably.
1 3089 
1 3090 I Player.
1 3091 I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
1 3092 
1 3093 Ham.
1 3094 O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns
1 3095 speak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them
1 3096 that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
1 3097 spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary
1 3098 question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous
1 3099 and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
1 3100 make you ready.
1 3101 
1 3102 [Exeunt Players.]
1 3103 
1 3104 [Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]
1 3105 
1 3106 How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?
1 3107 
1 3108 Pol.
1 3109 And the queen too, and that presently.
1 3110 
1 3111 Ham.
1 3112 Bid the players make haste.
1 3113 
1 3114 [Exit Polonius.]
1 3115 
1 3116 Will you two help to hasten them?
1 3117 
1 3118 Ros. and Guil.
1 3119 We will, my lord.
1 3120 
1 3121 [Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]
1 3122 
1 3123 Ham.
1 3124 What, ho, Horatio!
1 3125 
1 3126 [Enter Horatio.]
1 3127 
1 3128 Hor.
1 3129 Here, sweet lord, at your service.
1 3130 
1 3131 Ham.
1 3132 Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
1 3133 As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
1 3134 
1 3135 Hor.
1 3136 O, my dear lord,--
1 3137 
1 3138 Ham.
1 3139 Nay, do not think I flatter;
1 3140 For what advancement may I hope from thee,
1 3141 That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
1 3142 To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
1 3143 No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;
1 3144 And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
1 3145 Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
1 3146 Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,
1 3147 And could of men distinguish, her election
1 3148 Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been
1 3149 As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
1 3150 A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
1 3151 Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those
1 3152 Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
1 3153 That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
1 3154 To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
1 3155 That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
1 3156 In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
1 3157 As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
1 3158 There is a play to-night before the king;
1 3159 One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
1 3160 Which I have told thee, of my father's death:
1 3161 I pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,
1 3162 Even with the very comment of thy soul
1 3163 Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
1 3164 Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
1 3165 It is a damned ghost that we have seen;
1 3166 And my imaginations are as foul
1 3167 As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
1 3168 For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;
1 3169 And, after, we will both our judgments join
1 3170 In censure of his seeming.
1 3171 
1 3172 Hor.
1 3173 Well, my lord:
1 3174 If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
1 3175 And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
1 3176 
1 3177 Ham.
1 3178 They are coming to the play. I must be idle:
1 3179 Get you a place.
1 3180 
1 3181 [Danish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia,
1 3182 Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]
1 3183 
1 3184 King.
1 3185 How fares our cousin Hamlet?
1 3186 
1 3187 Ham.
1 3188 Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air,
1 3189 promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
1 3190 
1 3191 King.
1 3192 I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not
1 3193 mine.
1 3194 
1 3195 Ham.
1 3196 No, nor mine now. My lord, you play'd once i' the university, you
1 3197 say? [To Polonius.]
1 3198 
1 3199 Pol.
1 3200 That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
1 3201 
1 3202 Ham.
1 3203 What did you enact?
1 3204 
1 3205 Pol.
1 3206 I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' the Capitol; Brutus
1 3207 killed me.
1 3208 
1 3209 Ham.
1 3210 It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.--Be
1 3211 the players ready?
1 3212 
1 3213 Ros.
1 3214 Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
1 3215 
1 3216 Queen.
1 3217 Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
1 3218 
1 3219 Ham.
1 3220 No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
1 3221 
1 3222 Pol.
1 3223 O, ho! do you mark that? [To the King.]
1 3224 
1 3225 Ham.
1 3226 Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
1 3227 [Lying down at Ophelia's feet.]
1 3228 
1 3229 Oph.
1 3230 No, my lord.
1 3231 
1 3232 Ham.
1 3233 I mean, my head upon your lap?
1 3234 
1 3235 Oph.
1 3236 Ay, my lord.
1 3237 
1 3238 Ham.
1 3239 Do you think I meant country matters?
1 3240 
1 3241 Oph.
1 3242 I think nothing, my lord.
1 3243 
1 3244 Ham.
1 3245 That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
1 3246 
1 3247 Oph.
1 3248 What is, my lord?
1 3249 
1 3250 Ham.
1 3251 Nothing.
1 3252 
1 3253 Oph.
1 3254 You are merry, my lord.
1 3255 
1 3256 Ham.
1 3257 Who, I?
1 3258 
1 3259 Oph.
1 3260 Ay, my lord.
1 3261 
1 3262 Ham.
1 3263 O, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
1 3264 for look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
1 3265 within 's two hours.
1 3266 
1 3267 Oph.
1 3268 Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
1 3269 
1 3270 Ham.
1 3271 So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
1 3272 suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
1 3273 yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
1 3274 half a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or else
1 3275 shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose
1 3276 epitaph is 'For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
1 3277 
1 3278 [Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters.]
1 3279 
1 3280 [Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
1 3281 him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
1 3282 unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
1 3283 neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing
1 3284 him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
1 3285 crown, kisses it, pours poison in the king's ears, and exit. The
1 3286 Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action.
1 3287 The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,
1 3288 seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The
1 3289 Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she seems loth and unwilling
1 3290 awhile, but in the end accepts his love.]
1 3291 
1 3292 [Exeunt.]
1 3293 
1 3294 Oph.
1 3295 What means this, my lord?
1 3296 
1 3297 Ham.
1 3298 Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
1 3299 
1 3300 Oph.
1 3301 Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
1 3302 
1 3303 [Enter Prologue.]
1 3304 
1 3305 Ham.
1 3306 We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;
1 3307 they'll tell all.
1 3308 
1 3309 Oph.
1 3310 Will he tell us what this show meant?
1 3311 
1 3312 Ham.
1 3313 Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you ashamed to
1 3314 show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
1 3315 
1 3316 Oph.
1 3317 You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.

1 3320    For us, and for our tragedy,
1 3321    Here stooping to your clemency,
1 3322    We beg your hearing patiently.
1 3323 
1 3324 Ham.
1 3325 Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
1 3326 
1 3327 Oph.
1 3328 'Tis brief, my lord.
1 3329 
1 3330 Ham.
1 3331 As woman's love.
1 3332 
1 3333 [Enter a King and a Queen.]
1 3334 
1 3335 P. King.
1 3336 Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
1 3337 Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
1 3338 And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
1 3339 About the world have times twelve thirties been,
1 3340 Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
1 3341 Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
1 3342 
1 3343 P. Queen.
1 3344 So many journeys may the sun and moon
1 3345 Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
1 3346 But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
1 3347 So far from cheer and from your former state.
1 3348 That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
1 3349 Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
1 3350 For women's fear and love holds quantity;
1 3351 In neither aught, or in extremity.
1 3352 Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
1 3353 And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:
1 3354 Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
1 3355 Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
1 3356 
1 3357 P. King.
1 3358 Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
1 3359 My operant powers their functions leave to do:
1 3360 And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
1 3361 Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
1 3362 For husband shalt thou,--
1 3363 
1 3364 P. Queen.
1 3365 O, confound the rest!
1 3366 Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
1 3367 In second husband let me be accurst!
1 3368 None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
1 3369 
1 3370 Ham.
1 3371 [Aside.] Wormwood, wormwood!
1 3372 
1 3373 P. Queen.
1 3374 The instances that second marriage move
1 3375 Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
1 3376 A second time I kill my husband dead
1 3377 When second husband kisses me in bed.
1 3378 
1 3379 P. King.
1 3380 I do believe you think what now you speak;
1 3381 But what we do determine oft we break.
1 3382 Purpose is but the slave to memory;
1 3383 Of violent birth, but poor validity:
1 3384 Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
1 3385 But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
1 3386 Most necessary 'tis that we forget
1 3387 To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
1 3388 What to ourselves in passion we propose,
1 3389 The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
1 3390 The violence of either grief or joy
1 3391 Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
1 3392 Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
1 3393 Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
1 3394 This world is not for aye; nor 'tis not strange
1 3395 That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
1 3396 For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
1 3397 Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
1 3398 The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
1 3399 The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
1 3400 And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:
1 3401 For who not needs shall never lack a friend;
1 3402 And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
1 3403 Directly seasons him his enemy.
1 3404 But, orderly to end where I begun,--
1 3405 Our wills and fates do so contrary run
1 3406 That our devices still are overthrown;
1 3407 Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
1 3408 So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
1 3409 But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
1 3410 
1 3411 P. Queen.
1 3412 Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
1 3413 Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
1 3414 To desperation turn my trust and hope!
1 3415 An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
1 3416 Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
1 3417 Meet what I would have well, and it destroy!
1 3418 Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
1 3419 If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
1 3420 
1 3421 Ham.
1 3422 If she should break it now! [To Ophelia.]
1 3423 
1 3424 P. King.
1 3425 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
1 3426 My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
1 3427 The tedious day with sleep.
1 3428 [Sleeps.]
1 3429 
1 3430 P. Queen.
1 3431 Sleep rock thy brain,
1 3432 And never come mischance between us twain!
1 3433 
1 3434 [Exit.]
1 3435 
1 3436 Ham.
1 3437 Madam, how like you this play?
1 3438 
1 3439 Queen.
1 3440 The lady protests too much, methinks.
1 3441 
1 3442 Ham.
1 3443 O, but she'll keep her word.
1 3444 
1 3445 King.
1 3446 Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
1 3447 
1 3448 Ham.
1 3449 No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the
1 3450 world.
1 3451 
1 3452 King.
1 3453 What do you call the play?
1 3454 
1 3455 Ham.
1 3456 The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
1 3457 image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name;
1 3458 his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of
1 3459 work: but what o' that? your majesty, and we that have free
1 3460 souls, it touches us not: let the gall'd jade wince; our withers
1 3461 are unwrung.
1 3462 
1 3463 [Enter Lucianus.]
1 3464 
1 3465 This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.

1 3467 Oph.
1 3468 You are a good chorus, my lord.
1 3469 
1 3470 Ham.
1 3471 I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
1 3472 the puppets dallying.
1 3473 
1 3474 Oph.
1 3475 You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
1 3476 
1 3477 Ham.
1 3478 It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
1 3479 
1 3480 Oph.
1 3481 Still better, and worse.
1 3482 
1 3483 Ham.
1 3484 So you must take your husbands.--Begin, murderer; pox, leave
1 3485 thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:--'The croaking raven doth
1 3486 bellow for revenge.'
1 3487 
1 3488 Luc.
1 3489 Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
1 3490 Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
1 3491 Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
1 3492 With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
1 3493 Thy natural magic and dire property
1 3494 On wholesome life usurp immediately.
1 3495 
1 3496 [Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears.]
1 3497 
1 3498 Ham.
1 3499 He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago:
1 3500 The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian; you
1 3501 shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
1 3502 
1 3503 Oph.
1 3504 The King rises.

1 3506 Ham.
1 3507 What, frighted with false fire!

1 3509 Queen.
1 3510 How fares my lord?
1 3511 
1 3512 Pol.
1 3513 Give o'er the play.
1 3514 
1 3515 King.
1 3516 Give me some light:--away!
1 3517 
1 3518 All.
1 3519 Lights, lights, lights!
1 3520 
1 3521 [Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.]
1 3522 
1 3523 Ham.
1 3524    Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
1 3525      The hart ungalled play;
1 3526    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
1 3527      So runs the world away.--
1 3528 Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers--if the rest of my
1 3529 fortunes turn Turk with me,--with two Provincial roses on my
1 3530 razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
1 3531 
1 3532 Hor.
1 3533 Half a share.
1 3534 
1 3535 Ham.
1 3536      A whole one, I.
1 3537    For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
1 3538      This realm dismantled was
1 3539    Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
1 3540      A very, very--pajock.
1 3541 
1 3542 Hor.
1 3543 You might have rhymed.
1 3544 
1 3545 Ham.
1 3546 O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
1 3547 pound! Didst perceive?
1 3548 
1 3549 Hor.
1 3550 Very well, my lord.
1 3551 
1 3552 Ham.
1 3553 Upon the talk of the poisoning?--
1 3554 
1 3555 Hor.
1 3556 I did very well note him.

1 3558 Ham.
1 3559 Ah, ha!--Come, some music! Come, the recorders!--
1 3560    For if the king like not the comedy,
1 3561    Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
1 3562 Come, some music!

1 3567 Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

1 3569 Ham.
1 3570 Sir, a whole history.
1 3571 
1 3572 Guil.
1 3573 The king, sir--
1 3574 
1 3575 Ham.
1 3576 Ay, sir, what of him?
1 3577 
1 3578 Guil.
1 3579 Is, in his retirement, marvellous distempered.
1 3580 
1 3581 Ham.
1 3582 With drink, sir?
1 3583 
1 3584 Guil.
1 3585 No, my lord; rather with choler.
1 3586 
1 3587 Ham.
1 3588 Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
1 3589 the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
1 3590 plunge him into far more choler.
1 3591 
1 3592 Guil.
1 3593 Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
1 3594 not so wildly from my affair.
1 3595 
1 3596 Ham.
1 3597 I am tame, sir:--pronounce.
1 3598 
1 3599 Guil.
1 3600 The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit,
1 3601 hath sent me to you.
1 3602 
1 3603 Ham.
1 3604 You are welcome.
1 3605 
1 3606 Guil.
1 3607 Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
1 3608 If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
1 3609 your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
1 3610 shall be the end of my business.
1 3611 
1 3612 Ham.
1 3613 Sir, I cannot.
1 3614 
1 3615 Guil.
1 3616 What, my lord?
1 3617 
1 3618 Ham.
1 3619 Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such
1 3620 answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
1 3621 my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you
1 3622 say,--
1 3623 
1 3624 Ros.
1 3625 Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
1 3626 amazement and admiration.
1 3627 
1 3628 Ham.
1 3629 O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother!--But is there no
1 3630 sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?
1 3631 
1 3632 Ros.
1 3633 She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
1 3634 
1 3635 Ham.
1 3636 We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
1 3637 further trade with us?
1 3638 
1 3639 Ros.
1 3640 My lord, you once did love me.
1 3641 
1 3642 Ham.
1 3643 And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
1 3644 
1 3645 Ros.
1 3646 Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely,
1 3647 bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to
1 3648 your friend.
1 3649 
1 3650 Ham.
1 3651 Sir, I lack advancement.
1 3652 
1 3653 Ros.
1 3654 How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself
1 3655 for your succession in Denmark?
1 3656 
1 3657 Ham.
1 3658 Ay, sir, but 'While the grass grows'--the proverb is something
1 3659 musty.
1 3660 
1 3661 [Re-enter the Players, with recorders.]
1 3662 
1 3663 O, the recorders:--let me see one.--To withdraw with you:--why do
1 3664 you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
1 3665 into a toil?
1 3666 
1 3667 Guil.
1 3668 O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
1 3669 
1 3670 Ham.
1 3671 I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
1 3672 
1 3673 Guil.
1 3674 My lord, I cannot.
1 3675 
1 3676 Ham.
1 3677 I pray you.
1 3678 
1 3679 Guil.
1 3680 Believe me, I cannot.
1 3681 
1 3682 Ham.
1 3683 I do beseech you.
1 3684 
1 3685 Guil.
1 3686 I know, no touch of it, my lord.
1 3687 
1 3688 Ham.
1 3689 'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your
1 3690 finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
1 3691 discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
1 3692 
1 3693 Guil.
1 3694 But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I
1 3695 have not the skill.
1 3696 
1 3697 Ham.
1 3698 Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
1 3699 would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
1 3700 pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
1 3701 lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,
1 3702 excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
1 3703 speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a
1 3704 pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
1 3705 you cannot play upon me.
1 3706 
1 3707 [Enter Polonius.]
1 3708 
1 3709 God bless you, sir!
1 3710 
1 3711 Pol.
1 3712 My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
1 3713 
1 3714 Ham.
1 3715 Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
1 3716 
1 3717 Pol.
1 3718 By the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
1 3719 
1 3720 Ham.
1 3721 Methinks it is like a weasel.
1 3722 
1 3723 Pol.
1 3724 It is backed like a weasel.
1 3725 
1 3726 Ham.
1 3727 Or like a whale.
1 3728 
1 3729 Pol.
1 3730 Very like a whale.
1 3731 
1 3732 Ham.
1 3733 Then will I come to my mother by and by.--They fool me to the
1 3734 top of my bent.--I will come by and by.
1 3735 
1 3736 Pol.
1 3737 I will say so.
1 3738 
1 3739 [Exit.]
1 3740 
1 3741 Ham.
1 3742 By-and-by is easily said.

1 3745 
1 3746 --Leave me, friends.

1 3749 
1 3750 'Tis now the very witching time of night,
1 3751 When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
1 3752 Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
1 3753 And do such bitter business as the day
1 3754 Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.--
1 3755 O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
1 3756 The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
1 3757 Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
1 3758 I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
1 3759 My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites,--
1 3760 How in my words somever she be shent,
1 3761 To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

1 3768 
1 3769 [Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]
1 3770 
1 3771 King.
1 3772 I like him not; nor stands it safe with us
1 3773 To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
1 3774 I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
1 3775 And he to England shall along with you:
1 3776 The terms of our estate may not endure
1 3777 Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
1 3778 Out of his lunacies.
1 3779 
1 3780 Guil.
1 3781 We will ourselves provide:
1 3782 Most holy and religious fear it is
1 3783 To keep those many many bodies safe
1 3784 That live and feed upon your majesty.
1 3785 
1 3786 Ros.
1 3787 The single and peculiar life is bound,
1 3788 With all the strength and armour of the mind,
1 3789 To keep itself from 'noyance; but much more
1 3790 That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
1 3791 The lives of many. The cease of majesty
1 3792 Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw
1 3793 What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
1 3794 Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
1 3795 To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
1 3796 Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
1 3797 Each small annexment, petty consequence,
1 3798 Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
1 3799 Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
1 3800 
1 3801 King.
1 3802 Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
1 3803 For we will fetters put upon this fear,
1 3804 Which now goes too free-footed.
1 3805 
1 3806 Ros and Guil.
1 3807 We will haste us.

1 3810 
1 3811 [Enter Polonius.]
1 3812 
1 3813 Pol.
1 3814 My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
1 3815 Behind the arras I'll convey myself
1 3816 To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:
1 3817 And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
1 3818 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
1 3819 Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
1 3820 The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
1 3821 I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
1 3822 And tell you what I know.
1 3823 
1 3824 King.
1 3825 Thanks, dear my lord.
1 3826 
1 3827 [Exit Polonius.]
1 3828 
1 3829 O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
1 3830 It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,--
1 3831 A brother's murder!--Pray can I not,
1 3832 Though inclination be as sharp as will:
1 3833 My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
1 3834 And, like a man to double business bound,
1 3835 I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
1 3836 And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
1 3837 Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,--
1 3838 Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
1 3839 To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
1 3840 But to confront the visage of offence?
1 3841 And what's in prayer but this twofold force,--
1 3842 To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
1 3843 Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
1 3844 My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
1 3845 Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!--
1 3846 That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
1 3847 Of those effects for which I did the murder,--
1 3848 My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
1 3849 May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
1 3850 In the corrupted currents of this world
1 3851 Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice;
1 3852 And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
1 3853 Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above;
1 3854 There is no shuffling;--there the action lies
1 3855 In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
1 3856 Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
1 3857 To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
1 3858 Try what repentance can: what can it not?
1 3859 Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
1 3860 O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
1 3861 O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
1 3862 Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay:
1 3863 Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of steel,
1 3864 Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
1 3865 All may be well.

1 3867 [Retires and kneels.]
1 3868 
1 3869 [Enter Hamlet.]
1 3870 
1 3871 Ham.
1 3872 Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
1 3873 And now I'll do't;--and so he goes to heaven;
1 3874 And so am I reveng'd.--that would be scann'd:
1 3875 A villain kills my father; and for that,
1 3876 I, his sole son, do this same villain send
1 3877 To heaven.
1 3878 O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
1 3879 He took my father grossly, full of bread;
1 3880 With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
1 3881 And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
1 3882 But in our circumstance and course of thought,
1 3883 'Tis heavy with him: and am I, then, reveng'd,
1 3884 To take him in the purging of his soul,
1 3885 When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
1 3886 No.
1 3887 Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:
1 3888 When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
1 3889 Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
1 3890 At gaming, swearing; or about some act
1 3891 That has no relish of salvation in't;--
1 3892 Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven;
1 3893 And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
1 3894 As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
1 3895 This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

1 3913 Pol.
1 3914 He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
1 3915 Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
1 3916 And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
1 3917 Much heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here.
1 3918 Pray you, be round with him.
1 3919 
1 3920 Ham.
1 3921 [Within.] Mother, mother, mother!

1 3923 Queen.
1 3924 I'll warrant you:
1 3925 Fear me not:--withdraw; I hear him coming.

1 3930 
1 3931 Ham.
1 3932 Now, mother, what's the matter?
1 3933 
1 3934 Queen.
1 3935 Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
1 3936 
1 3937 Ham.
1 3938 Mother, you have my father much offended.
1 3939 
1 3940 Queen.
1 3941 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
1 3942 
1 3943 Ham.
1 3944 Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
1 3945 
1 3946 Queen.
1 3947 Why, how now, Hamlet!
1 3948 
1 3949 Ham.
1 3950 What's the matter now?
1 3951 
1 3952 Queen.
1 3953 Have you forgot me?
1 3954 
1 3955 Ham.
1 3956 No, by the rood, not so:
1 3957 You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
1 3958 And,--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
1 3959 
1 3960 Queen.
1 3961 Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
1 3962 
1 3963 Ham.
1 3964 Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
1 3965 You go not till I set you up a glass
1 3966 Where you may see the inmost part of you.
1 3967 
1 3968 Queen.
1 3969 What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?--
1 3970 Help, help, ho!
1 3971 
1 3972 Pol.
1 3973 [Behind.] What, ho! help, help, help!
1 3974 
1 3975 Ham.
1 3976 How now? a rat? [Draws.]
1 3977 Dead for a ducat, dead!
1 3978 
1 3979 [Makes a pass through the arras.]
1 3980 
1 3981 Pol.
1 3982 [Behind.] O, I am slain!
1 3983 
1 3984 [Falls and dies.]
1 3985 
1 3986 Queen.
1 3987 O me, what hast thou done?
1 3988 
1 3989 Ham.
1 3990 Nay, I know not: is it the king?
1 3991 
1 3992 [Draws forth Polonius.]
1 3993 
1 3994 Queen.
1 3995 O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
1 3996 
1 3997 Ham.
1 3998 A bloody deed!--almost as bad, good mother,
1 3999 As kill a king and marry with his brother.
1 4000 
1 4001 Queen.
1 4002 As kill a king!
1 4003 
1 4004 Ham.
1 4005 Ay, lady, 'twas my word.--
1 4006 Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
1 4007 [To Polonius.]
1 4008 I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
1 4009 Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.--
1 4010 Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
1 4011 And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,
1 4012 If it be made of penetrable stuff;
1 4013 If damned custom have not braz'd it so
1 4014 That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
1 4015 
1 4016 Queen.
1 4017 What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
1 4018 In noise so rude against me?
1 4019 
1 4020 Ham.
1 4021 Such an act
1 4022 That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
1 4023 Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
1 4024 From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
1 4025 And sets a blister there; makes marriage-vows
1 4026 As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
1 4027 As from the body of contraction plucks
1 4028 The very soul, and sweet religion makes
1 4029 A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;
1 4030 Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
1 4031 With tristful visage, as against the doom,
1 4032 Is thought-sick at the act.
1 4033 
1 4034 Queen.
1 4035 Ah me, what act,
1 4036 That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
1 4037 
1 4038 Ham.
1 4039 Look here upon this picture, and on this,--
1 4040 The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
1 4041 See what a grace was seated on this brow;
1 4042 Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
1 4043 An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
1 4044 A station like the herald Mercury
1 4045 New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
1 4046 A combination and a form, indeed,
1 4047 Where every god did seem to set his seal,
1 4048 To give the world assurance of a man;
1 4049 This was your husband.--Look you now what follows:
1 4050 Here is your husband, like a milldew'd ear
1 4051 Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
1 4052 Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
1 4053 And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
1 4054 You cannot call it love; for at your age
1 4055 The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
1 4056 And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
1 4057 Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
1 4058 Else could you not have motion: but sure that sense
1 4059 Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err;
1 4060 Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
1 4061 But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
1 4062 To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
1 4063 That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
1 4064 Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
1 4065 Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
1 4066 Or but a sickly part of one true sense
1 4067 Could not so mope.
1 4068 O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
1 4069 If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
1 4070 To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
1 4071 And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
1 4072 When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
1 4073 Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
1 4074 And reason panders will.
1 4075 
1 4076 Queen.
1 4077 O Hamlet, speak no more:
1 4078 Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
1 4079 And there I see such black and grained spots
1 4080 As will not leave their tinct.
1 4081 
1 4082 Ham.
1 4083 Nay, but to live
1 4084 In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
1 4085 Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
1 4086 Over the nasty sty,--
1 4087 
1 4088 Queen.
1 4089 O, speak to me no more;
1 4090 These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
1 4091 No more, sweet Hamlet.
1 4092 
1 4093 Ham.
1 4094 A murderer and a villain;
1 4095 A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
1 4096 Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
1 4097 A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
1 4098 That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
1 4099 And put it in his pocket!
1 4100 
1 4101 Queen.
1 4102 No more.
1 4103 
1 4104 Ham.
1 4105 A king of shreds and patches!--
1 4106 
1 4107 [Enter Ghost.]
1 4108 
1 4109 Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
1 4110 You heavenly guards!--What would your gracious figure?
1 4111 
1 4112 Queen.
1 4113 Alas, he's mad!
1 4114 
1 4115 Ham.
1 4116 Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
1 4117 That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
1 4118 The important acting of your dread command?
1 4119 O, say!
1 4120 
1 4121 Ghost.
1 4122 Do not forget. This visitation
1 4123 Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
1 4124 But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
1 4125 O, step between her and her fighting soul,--
1 4126 Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works,--
1 4127 Speak to her, Hamlet.
1 4128 
1 4129 Ham.
1 4130 How is it with you, lady?
1 4131 
1 4132 Queen.
1 4133 Alas, how is't with you,
1 4134 That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
1 4135 And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
1 4136 Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
1 4137 And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
1 4138 Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
1 4139 Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
1 4140 Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
1 4141 Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
1 4142 
1 4143 Ham.
1 4144 On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
1 4145 His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
1 4146 Would make them capable.--Do not look upon me;
1 4147 Lest with this piteous action you convert
1 4148 My stern effects: then what I have to do
1 4149 Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
1 4150 
1 4151 Queen.
1 4152 To whom do you speak this?
1 4153 
1 4154 Ham.
1 4155 Do you see nothing there?
1 4156 
1 4157 Queen.
1 4158 Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
1 4159 
1 4160 Ham.
1 4161 Nor did you nothing hear?
1 4162 
1 4163 Queen.
1 4164 No, nothing but ourselves.
1 4165 
1 4166 Ham.
1 4167 Why, look you there! look how it steals away!
1 4168 My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
1 4169 Look, where he goes, even now out at the portal!
1 4170 
1 4171 [Exit Ghost.]
1 4172 
1 4173 Queen.
1 4174 This is the very coinage of your brain:
1 4175 This bodiless creation ecstasy
1 4176 Is very cunning in.
1 4177 
1 4178 Ham.
1 4179 Ecstasy!
1 4180 My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
1 4181 And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
1 4182 That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
1 4183 And I the matter will re-word; which madness
1 4184 Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
1 4185 Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
1 4186 That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
1 4187 It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
1 4188 Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
1 4189 Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
1 4190 Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
1 4191 And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
1 4192 To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
1 4193 For in the fatness of these pursy times
1 4194 Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
1 4195 Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
1 4196 
1 4197 Queen.
1 4198 O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
1 4199 
1 4200 Ham.
1 4201 O, throw away the worser part of it,
1 4202 And live the purer with the other half.
1 4203 Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
1 4204 Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
1 4205 That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
1 4206 Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,--
1 4207 That to the use of actions fair and good
1 4208 He likewise gives a frock or livery
1 4209 That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
1 4210 And that shall lend a kind of easiness
1 4211 To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
1 4212 For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
1 4213 And either curb the devil, or throw him out
1 4214 With wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:
1 4215 And when you are desirous to be bles'd,
1 4216 I'll blessing beg of you.--For this same lord
1 4217 [Pointing to Polonius.]
1 4218 I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
1 4219 To punish me with this, and this with me,
1 4220 That I must be their scourge and minister.
1 4221 I will bestow him, and will answer well
1 4222 The death I gave him. So again, good-night.--
1 4223 I must be cruel, only to be kind:
1 4224 Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.--
1 4225 One word more, good lady.
1 4226 
1 4227 Queen.
1 4228 What shall I do?
1 4229 
1 4230 Ham.
1 4231 Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
1 4232 Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
1 4233 Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
1 4234 And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
1 4235 Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
1 4236 Make you to ravel all this matter out,
1 4237 That I essentially am not in madness,
1 4238 But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
1 4239 For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
1 4240 Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
1 4241 Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
1 4242 No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
1 4243 Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
1 4244 Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
1 4245 To try conclusions, in the basket creep
1 4246 And break your own neck down.
1 4247 
1 4248 Queen.
1 4249 Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
1 4250 And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
1 4251 What thou hast said to me.
1 4252 
1 4253 Ham.
1 4254 I must to England; you know that?
1 4255 
1 4256 Queen.
1 4257 Alack,
1 4258 I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
1 4259 
1 4260 Ham.
1 4261 There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,--
1 4262 Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,--
1 4263 They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
1 4264 And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
1 4265 For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
1 4266 Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
1 4267 But I will delve one yard below their mines
1 4268 And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
1 4269 When in one line two crafts directly meet.--
1 4270 This man shall set me packing:
1 4271 I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.--
1 4272 Mother, good-night.--Indeed, this counsellor
1 4273 Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
1 4274 Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
1 4275 Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you:--
1 4276 Good night, mother.
1 4277 
1 4278 [Exeunt severally; Hamlet, dragging out Polonius.]
1 4279 
1 4280 
1 4281 
1 4282 ACT IV.
1 4283 
1 4284 Scene I. A room in the Castle.
1 4285 
1 4286 [Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
1 4287 
1 4288 King.
1 4289 There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
1 4290 You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
1 4291 Where is your son?
1 4292 
1 4293 Queen.
1 4294 Bestow this place on us a little while.
1 4295 
1 4296 [To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out.]
1 4297 
1 4298 Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
1 4299 
1 4300 King.
1 4301 What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
1 4302 
1 4303 Queen.
1 4304 Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
1 4305 Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit
1 4306 Behind the arras hearing something stir,
1 4307 Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
1 4308 And in this brainish apprehension, kills
1 4309 The unseen good old man.
1 4310 
1 4311 King.
1 4312 O heavy deed!
1 4313 It had been so with us, had we been there:
1 4314 His liberty is full of threats to all;
1 4315 To you yourself, to us, to every one.
1 4316 Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
1 4317 It will be laid to us, whose providence
1 4318 Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
1 4319 This mad young man. But so much was our love
1 4320 We would not understand what was most fit;
1 4321 But, like the owner of a foul disease,
1 4322 To keep it from divulging, let it feed
1 4323 Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
1 4324 
1 4325 Queen.
1 4326 To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
1 4327 O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
1 4328 Among a mineral of metals base,
1 4329 Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.
1 4330 
1 4331 King.
1 4332 O Gertrude, come away!
1 4333 The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
1 4334 But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
1 4335 We must with all our majesty and skill
1 4336 Both countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!
1 4337 
1 4338 [Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
1 4339 
1 4340 Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
1 4341 Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
1 4342 And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
1 4343 Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
1 4344 Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
1 4345 
1 4346 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
1 4347 
1 4348 Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
1 4349 And let them know both what we mean to do
1 4350 And what's untimely done: so haply slander,--
1 4351 Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
1 4352 As level as the cannon to his blank,
1 4353 Transports his poison'd shot,--may miss our name,
1 4354 And hit the woundless air.--O, come away!
1 4355 My soul is full of discord and dismay.
1 4356 
1 4357 [Exeunt.]
1 4358 
1 4359 Scene II. Another room in the Castle.
1 4360 
1 4361 [Enter Hamlet.]
1 4362 
1 4363 Ham.
1 4364 Safely stowed.
1 4365 
1 4366 Ros. and Guil.
1 4367 [Within.] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
1 4368 
1 4369 Ham.
1 4370 What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
1 4371 
1 4372 [Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
1 4373 
1 4374 Ros.
1 4375 What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
1 4376 
1 4377 Ham.
1 4378 Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
1 4379 
1 4380 Ros.
1 4381 Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
1 4382 And bear it to the chapel.
1 4383 
1 4384 Ham.
1 4385 Do not believe it.
1 4386 
1 4387 Ros.
1 4388 Believe what?
1 4389 
1 4390 Ham.
1 4391 That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
1 4392 demanded of a sponge!--what replication should be made by the son
1 4393 of a king?
1 4394 
1 4395 Ros.
1 4396 Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
1 4397 
1 4398 Ham.
1 4399 Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
1 4400 his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in
1 4401 the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
1 4402 first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
1 4403 gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry
1 4404 again.
1 4405 
1 4406 Ros.
1 4407 I understand you not, my lord.
1 4408 
1 4409 Ham.
1 4410 I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
1 4411 
1 4412 Ros.
1 4413 My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
1 4414 the king.
1 4415 
1 4416 Ham.
1 4417 The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
1 4418 The king is a thing,--
1 4419 
1 4420 Guil.
1 4421 A thing, my lord!
1 4422 
1 4423 Ham.
1 4424 Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
1 4425 
1 4426 [Exeunt.]
1 4427 
1 4428 
1 4429 
1 4430 Scene III. Another room in the Castle.
1 4431 
1 4432 [Enter King,attended.]
1 4433 
1 4434 King.
1 4435 I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
1 4436 How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
1 4437 Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
1 4438 He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
1 4439 Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
1 4440 And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
1 4441 But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
1 4442 This sudden sending him away must seem
1 4443 Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
1 4444 By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
1 4445 Or not at all.
1 4446 
1 4447 [Enter Rosencrantz.]
1 4448 
1 4449 How now! what hath befall'n?
1 4450 
1 4451 Ros.
1 4452 Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
1 4453 We cannot get from him.
1 4454 
1 4455 King.
1 4456 But where is he?
1 4457 
1 4458 Ros.
1 4459 Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
1 4460 
1 4461 King.
1 4462 Bring him before us.
1 4463 
1 4464 Ros.
1 4465 Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
1 4466 
1 4467 [Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.]
1 4468 
1 4469 King.
1 4470 Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
1 4471 
1 4472 Ham.
1 4473 At supper.
1 4474 
1 4475 King.
1 4476 At supper! where?
1 4477 
1 4478 Ham.
1 4479 Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
1 4480 convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
1 4481 only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and
1 4482 we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar
1 4483 is but variable service,--two dishes, but to one table: that's
1 4484 the end.
1 4485 
1 4486 King.
1 4487 Alas, alas!
1 4488 
1 4489 Ham.
1 4490 A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
1 4491 of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
1 4492 
1 4493 King.
1 4494 What dost thou mean by this?
1 4495 
1 4496 Ham.
1 4497 Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
1 4498 the guts of a beggar.
1 4499 
1 4500 King.
1 4501 Where is Polonius?
1 4502 
1 4503 Ham.
1 4504 In heaven: send thither to see: if your messenger find him not
1 4505 there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you
1 4506 find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
1 4507 the stairs into the lobby.
1 4508 
1 4509 King.
1 4510 Go seek him there. [To some Attendants.]
1 4511 
1 4512 Ham.
1 4513 He will stay till you come.
1 4514 
1 4515 [Exeunt Attendants.]
1 4516 
1 4517 King.
1 4518 Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
1 4519 Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
1 4520 For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
1 4521 With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
1 4522 The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
1 4523 The associates tend, and everything is bent
1 4524 For England.
1 4525 
1 4526 Ham.
1 4527 For England!
1 4528 
1 4529 King.
1 4530 Ay, Hamlet.
1 4531 
1 4532 Ham.
1 4533 Good.
1 4534 
1 4535 King.
1 4536 So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
1 4537 
1 4538 Ham.
1 4539 I see a cherub that sees them.--But, come; for England!--
1 4540 Farewell, dear mother.
1 4541 
1 4542 King.
1 4543 Thy loving father, Hamlet.
1 4544 
1 4545 Ham.
1 4546 My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
1 4547 one flesh; and so, my mother.--Come, for England!
1 4548 
1 4549 [Exit.]
1 4550 
1 4551 King.
1 4552 Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
1 4553 Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
1 4554 Away! for everything is seal'd and done
1 4555 That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
1 4556 
1 4557 [Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
1 4558 
1 4559 And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,--
1 4560 As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
1 4561 Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
1 4562 After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
1 4563 Pays homage to us,--thou mayst not coldly set
1 4564 Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
1 4565 By letters conjuring to that effect,
1 4566 The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
1 4567 For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
1 4568 And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
1 4569 Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
1 4570

1 4575 Scene IV. A plain in Denmark.
1 4576 
1 4577 [Enter Fortinbras, and Forces marching.]
1 4578 
1 4579 For.
1 4580 Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king:
1 4581 Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras
1 4582 Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
1 4583 Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
1 4584 If that his majesty would aught with us,
1 4585 We shall express our duty in his eye;
1 4586 And let him know so.
1 4587 
1 4588 Capt.
1 4589 I will do't, my lord.
1 4590 
1 4591 For.
1 4592 Go softly on.
1 4593 
1 4594 [Exeunt all For. and Forces.]
1 4595 
1 4596 [Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, &c.]
1 4597 
1 4598 Ham.
1 4599 Good sir, whose powers are these?
1 4600 
1 4601 Capt.
1 4602 They are of Norway, sir.
1 4603 
1 4604 Ham.
1 4605 How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
1 4606 
1 4607 Capt.
1 4608 Against some part of Poland.
1 4609 
1 4610 Ham.
1 4611 Who commands them, sir?
1 4612 
1 4613 Capt.
1 4614 The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
1 4615 
1 4616 Ham.
1 4617 Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
1 4618 Or for some frontier?
1 4619 
1 4620 Capt.
1 4621 Truly to speak, and with no addition,
1 4622 We go to gain a little patch of ground
1 4623 That hath in it no profit but the name.
1 4624 To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
1 4625 Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
1 4626 A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
1 4627 
1 4628 Ham.
1 4629 Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
1 4630 
1 4631 Capt.
1 4632 Yes, it is already garrison'd.
1 4633 
1 4634 Ham.
1 4635 Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
1 4636 Will not debate the question of this straw:
1 4637 This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
1 4638 That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
1 4639 Why the man dies.--I humbly thank you, sir.
1 4640 
1 4641 Capt.
1 4642 God b' wi' you, sir.
1 4643 
1 4644 [Exit.]
1 4645 
1 4646 Ros.
1 4647 Will't please you go, my lord?
1 4648 
1 4649 Ham.
1 4650 I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
1 4651 
1 4652 [Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
1 4653 
1 4654 How all occasions do inform against me
1 4655 And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
1 4656 If his chief good and market of his time
1 4657 Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
1 4658 Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
1 4659 Looking before and after, gave us not
1 4660 That capability and godlike reason
1 4661 To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
1 4662 Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
1 4663 Of thinking too precisely on the event,--
1 4664 A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
1 4665 And ever three parts coward,--I do not know
1 4666 Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
1 4667 Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
1 4668 To do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:
1 4669 Witness this army, of such mass and charge,
1 4670 Led by a delicate and tender prince;
1 4671 Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
1 4672 Makes mouths at the invisible event;
1 4673 Exposing what is mortal and unsure
1 4674 To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
1 4675 Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
1 4676 Is not to stir without great argument,
1 4677 But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
1 4678 When honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,
1 4679 That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
1 4680 Excitements of my reason and my blood,
1 4681 And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
1 4682 The imminent death of twenty thousand men
1 4683 That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
1 4684 Go to their graves like beds; fight for a plot
1 4685 Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
1 4686 Which is not tomb enough and continent
1 4687 To hide the slain?--O, from this time forth,
1 4688 My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

1 4694 Scene V. Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
1 4695 
1 4696 [Enter Queen and Horatio.]
1 4697 
1 4698 Queen.
1 4699 I will not speak with her.
1 4700 
1 4701 Gent.
1 4702 She is importunate; indeed distract:
1 4703 Her mood will needs be pitied.
1 4704 
1 4705 Queen.
1 4706 What would she have?
1 4707 
1 4708 Gent.
1 4709 She speaks much of her father; says she hears
1 4710 There's tricks i' the world, and hems, and beats her heart;
1 4711 Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
1 4712 That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
1 4713 Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
1 4714 The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
1 4715 And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
1 4716 Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
1 4717 Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
1 4718 Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
1 4719 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
1 4720 Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
1 4721 
1 4722 Queen.
1 4723 Let her come in.
1 4724 
1 4725 [Exit Horatio.]
1 4726 
1 4727 To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
1 4728 Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss:
1 4729 So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
1 4730 It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
1 4731 
1 4732 [Re-enter Horatio with Ophelia.]
1 4733 
1 4734 Oph.
1 4735 Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
1 4736 
1 4737 Queen.
1 4738 How now, Ophelia?
1 4739 
1 4740 Oph. [Sings.]
1 4741    How should I your true love know
1 4742      From another one?
1 4743    By his cockle bat and' staff
1 4744      And his sandal shoon.
1 4745 
1 4746 Queen.
1 4747 Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
1 4748 
1 4749 Oph.
1 4750 Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
1 4751 [Sings.]
1 4752    He is dead and gone, lady,
1 4753      He is dead and gone;
1 4754    At his head a grass green turf,
1 4755      At his heels a stone.
1 4756 
1 4757 Queen.
1 4758 Nay, but Ophelia--
1 4759 
1 4760 Oph.
1 4761 Pray you, mark.
1 4762 [Sings.]
1 4763    White his shroud as the mountain snow,
1 4764 
1 4765 [Enter King.]
1 4766 
1 4767 Queen.
1 4768 Alas, look here, my lord!
1 4769 
1 4770 Oph.
1 4771 [Sings.]
1 4772      Larded all with sweet flowers;
1 4773    Which bewept to the grave did go
1 4774      With true-love showers.
1 4775 
1 4776 King.
1 4777 How do you, pretty lady?
1 4778 
1 4779 Oph.
1 4780 Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
1 4781 Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
1 4782 your table!
1 4783 
1 4784 King.
1 4785 Conceit upon her father.
1 4786 
1 4787 Oph.
1 4788 Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what
1 4789 it means, say you this:
1 4790 [Sings.]
1 4791    To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day
1 4792      All in the morning bedtime,
1 4793    And I a maid at your window,
1 4794      To be your Valentine.
1 4795 
1 4796    Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,
1 4797      And dupp'd the chamber door,
1 4798    Let in the maid, that out a maid
1 4799      Never departed more.
1 4800 
1 4801 King.
1 4802 Pretty Ophelia!
1 4803 
1 4804 Oph.
1 4805 Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
1 4806 [Sings.]
1 4807    By Gis and by Saint Charity,
1 4808      Alack, and fie for shame!
1 4809    Young men will do't if they come to't;
1 4810      By cock, they are to blame.
1 4811 
1 4812    Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
1 4813      You promis'd me to wed.
1 4814    So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
1 4815      An thou hadst not come to my bed.
1 4816 
1 4817 King.
1 4818 How long hath she been thus?
1 4819 
1 4820 Oph.
1 4821 I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot
1 4822 choose but weep, to think they would lay him i' the cold ground.
1 4823 My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good
1 4824 counsel.--Come, my coach!--Good night, ladies; good night, sweet
1 4825 ladies; good night, good night.
1 4826 
1 4827 [Exit.]
1 4828 
1 4829 King.
1 4830 Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
1 4831 
1 4832 [Exit Horatio.]
1 4833 
1 4834 O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
1 4835 All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
1 4836 When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
1 4837 But in battalions! First, her father slain:
1 4838 Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
1 4839 Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
1 4840 Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
1 4841 For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly
1 4842 In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
1 4843 Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
1 4844 Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts:
1 4845 Last, and as much containing as all these,
1 4846 Her brother is in secret come from France;
1 4847 Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
1 4848 And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
1 4849 With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
1 4850 Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
1 4851 Will nothing stick our person to arraign
1 4852 In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
1 4853 Like to a murdering piece, in many places
1 4854 Give, me superfluous death.
1 4855 
1 4856 [A noise within.]
1 4857 
1 4858 Queen.
1 4859 Alack, what noise is this?
1 4860 
1 4861 King.
1 4862 Where are my Switzers? let them guard the door.
1 4863 
1 4864 [Enter a Gentleman.]
1 4865 
1 4866 What is the matter?
1 4867 
1 4868 Gent.
1 4869 Save yourself, my lord:
1 4870 The ocean, overpeering of his list,
1 4871 Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
1 4872 Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
1 4873 O'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord;
1 4874 And, as the world were now but to begin,
1 4875 Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
1 4876 The ratifiers and props of every word,
1 4877 They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
1 4878 Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
1 4879 'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
1 4880 
1 4881 Queen.
1 4882 How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
1 4883 O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
1 4884 
1 4885 [A noise within.]
1 4886 
1 4887 King.
1 4888 The doors are broke.
1 4889 
1 4890 [Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.]
1 4891 
1 4892 Laer.
1 4893 Where is this king?--Sirs, stand you all without.
1 4894 
1 4895 Danes.
1 4896 No, let's come in.
1 4897 
1 4898 Laer.
1 4899 I pray you, give me leave.
1 4900 
1 4901 Danes.
1 4902 We will, we will.
1 4903 
1 4904 [They retire without the door.]
1 4905 
1 4906 Laer.
1 4907 I thank you:--keep the door.--O thou vile king,
1 4908 Give me my father!
1 4909 
1 4910 Queen.
1 4911 Calmly, good Laertes.
1 4912 
1 4913 Laer.
1 4914 That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
1 4915 Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
1 4916 Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
1 4917 Of my true mother.
1 4918 
1 4919 King.
1 4920 What is the cause, Laertes,
1 4921 That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?--
1 4922 Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
1 4923 There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
1 4924 That treason can but peep to what it would,
1 4925 Acts little of his will.--Tell me, Laertes,
1 4926 Why thou art thus incens'd.--Let him go, Gertrude:--
1 4927 Speak, man.
1 4928 
1 4929 Laer.
1 4930 Where is my father?
1 4931 
1 4932 King.
1 4933 Dead.
1 4934 
1 4935 Queen.
1 4936 But not by him.
1 4937 
1 4938 King.
1 4939 Let him demand his fill.
1 4940 
1 4941 Laer.
1 4942 How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
1 4943 To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
1 4944 Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
1 4945 I dare damnation:--to this point I stand,--
1 4946 That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
1 4947 Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
1 4948 Most throughly for my father.
1 4949 
1 4950 King.
1 4951 Who shall stay you?
1 4952 
1 4953 Laer.
1 4954 My will, not all the world:
1 4955 And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
1 4956 They shall go far with little.
1 4957 
1 4958 King.
1 4959 Good Laertes,
1 4960 If you desire to know the certainty
1 4961 Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
1 4962 That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
1 4963 Winner and loser?
1 4964 
1 4965 Laer.
1 4966 None but his enemies.
1 4967 
1 4968 King.
1 4969 Will you know them then?
1 4970 
1 4971 Laer.
1 4972 To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
1 4973 And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,
1 4974 Repast them with my blood.
1 4975 
1 4976 King.
1 4977 Why, now you speak
1 4978 Like a good child and a true gentleman.
1 4979 That I am guiltless of your father's death,
1 4980 And am most sensibly in grief for it,
1 4981 It shall as level to your judgment pierce
1 4982 As day does to your eye.
1 4983 
1 4984 Danes.
1 4985 [Within] Let her come in.
1 4986 
1 4987 Laer.
1 4988 How now! What noise is that?
1 4989 
1 4990 [Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and
1 4991 flowers.]
1 4992 
1 4993 O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
1 4994 Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!--
1 4995 By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
1 4996 Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
1 4997 Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!--
1 4998 O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
1 4999 Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
1 5000 Nature is fine in love; and where 'tis fine,
1 5001 It sends some precious instance of itself
1 5002 After the thing it loves.
1 5003 
1 5004 Oph.
1 5005 [Sings.]
1 5006    They bore him barefac'd on the bier
1 5007    Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny
1 5008    And on his grave rain'd many a tear.--
1 5009 
1 5010 Fare you well, my dove!
1 5011 
1 5012 Laer.
1 5013 Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
1 5014 It could not move thus.
1 5015 
1 5016 Oph.
1 5017 You must sing 'Down a-down, an you call him a-down-a.' O,
1 5018 how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
1 5019 master's daughter.
1 5020 
1 5021 Laer.
1 5022 This nothing's more than matter.
1 5023 
1 5024 Oph.
1 5025 There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love,
1 5026 remember: and there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
1 5027 
1 5028 Laer.
1 5029 A document in madness,--thoughts and remembrance fitted.
1 5030 
1 5031 Oph.
1 5032 There's fennel for you, and columbines:--there's rue for you;
1 5033 and here's some for me:--we may call it herb of grace o'
1 5034 Sundays:--O, you must wear your rue with a difference.--There's a
1 5035 daisy:--I would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when
1 5036 my father died:--they say he made a good end,--
1 5037 [Sings.]
1 5038    For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy,--
1 5039 
1 5040 Laer.
1 5041 Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
1 5042 She turns to favour and to prettiness.
1 5043 
1 5044 Oph.
1 5045 [Sings.]
1 5046    And will he not come again?
1 5047    And will he not come again?
1 5048      No, no, he is dead,
1 5049      Go to thy death-bed,
1 5050    He never will come again.
1 5051 
1 5052    His beard was as white as snow,
1 5053    All flaxen was his poll:
1 5054      He is gone, he is gone,
1 5055      And we cast away moan:
1 5056    God ha' mercy on his soul!
1 5057 
1 5058 And of all Christian souls, I pray God.--God b' wi' ye.
1 5059 
1 5060 [Exit.]
1 5061 
1 5062 Laer.
1 5063 Do you see this, O God?
1 5064 
1 5065 King.
1 5066 Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
1 5067 Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
1 5068 Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
1 5069 And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
1 5070 If by direct or by collateral hand
1 5071 They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
1 5072 Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
1 5073 To you in satisfaction; but if not,
1 5074 Be you content to lend your patience to us,
1 5075 And we shall jointly labour with your soul
1 5076 To give it due content.
1 5077 
1 5078 Laer.
1 5079 Let this be so;
1 5080 His means of death, his obscure burial,--
1 5081 No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
1 5082 No noble rite nor formal ostentation,--
1 5083 Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
1 5084 That I must call't in question.
1 5085 
1 5086 King.
1 5087 So you shall;
1 5088 And where the offence is let the great axe fall.

1 5122 He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
1 5123 sir,--it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if
1 5124 your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
1 5125 
1 5126 Hor.
1 5127 [Reads.] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
1 5128 this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have
1 5129 letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
1 5130 very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
1 5131 slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
1 5132 boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
1 5133 alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
1 5134 of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for
1 5135 them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou
1 5136 to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
1 5137 to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
1 5138 light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
1 5139 thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
1 5140 for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
1 5141 He that thou knowest thine,       HAMLET.'
1 5142 
1 5143 Come, I will give you way for these your letters;
1 5144 And do't the speedier, that you may direct me

1 5158 Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
1 5159 That he which hath your noble father slain
1 5160 Pursu'd my life.
1 5161 
1 5162 Laer.
1 5163 It well appears:--but tell me
1 5164 Why you proceeded not against these feats,
1 5165 So crimeful and so capital in nature,
1 5166 As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
1 5167 You mainly were stirr'd up.
1 5168 
1 5169 King.
1 5170 O, for two special reasons;
1 5171 Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
1 5172 But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
1 5173 Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,--
1 5174 My virtue or my plague, be it either which,--
1 5175 She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
1 5176 That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
1 5177 I could not but by her. The other motive,
1 5178 Why to a public count I might not go,
1 5179 Is the great love the general gender bear him;
1 5180 Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
1 5181 Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
1 5182 Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
1 5183 Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
1 5184 Would have reverted to my bow again,
1 5185 And not where I had aim'd them.
1 5186 
1 5187 Laer.
1 5188 And so have I a noble father lost;
1 5189 A sister driven into desperate terms,--
1 5190 Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
1 5191 Stood challenger on mount of all the age
1 5192 For her perfections:--but my revenge will come.
1 5193 
1 5194 King.
1 5195 Break not your sleeps for that:--you must not think
1 5196 That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
1 5197 That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
1 5198 And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
1 5199 I lov'd your father, and we love ourself;
1 5200 And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine,--
1 5201 
1 5202 [Enter a Messenger.]
1 5203 
1 5204 How now! What news?
1 5205 
1 5206 Mess.
1 5207 Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
1 5208 This to your majesty; this to the queen.
1 5209 
1 5210 King.
1 5211 From Hamlet! Who brought them?
1 5212 
1 5213 Mess.
1 5214 Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
1 5215 They were given me by Claudio:--he receiv'd them
1 5216 Of him that brought them.
1 5217 
1 5218 King.
1 5219 Laertes, you shall hear them.
1 5220 Leave us.
1 5221 
1 5222 [Exit Messenger.]
1 5223 
1 5224 [Reads]'High and mighty,--You shall know I am set naked on your
1 5225 kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes:
1 5226 when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the
1 5227 occasions of my sudden and more strange return.       HAMLET.'
1 5228 
1 5229 What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
1 5230 Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
1 5231 
1 5232 Laer.
1 5233 Know you the hand?
1 5234 
1 5235 King.
1 5236 'Tis Hamlet's character:--'Naked!'--
1 5237 And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
1 5238 Can you advise me?
1 5239 
1 5240 Laer.
1 5241 I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
1 5242 It warms the very sickness in my heart
1 5243 That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
1 5244 'Thus didest thou.'
1 5245 
1 5246 King.
1 5247 If it be so, Laertes,--
1 5248 As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
1 5249 Will you be rul'd by me?
1 5250 
1 5251 Laer.
1 5252 Ay, my lord;
1 5253 So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
1 5254 
1 5255 King.
1 5256 To thine own peace. If he be now return'd--
1 5257 As checking at his voyage, and that he means
1 5258 No more to undertake it,--I will work him
1 5259 To exploit, now ripe in my device,
1 5260 Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
1 5261 And for his death no wind shall breathe;
1 5262 But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
1 5263 And call it accident.
1 5264 
1 5265 Laer.
1 5266 My lord, I will be rul'd;
1 5267 The rather if you could devise it so
1 5268 That I might be the organ.
1 5269 
1 5270 King.
1 5271 It falls right.
1 5272 You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
1 5273 And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
1 5274 Wherein they say you shine: your sum of parts
1 5275 Did not together pluck such envy from him
1 5276 As did that one; and that, in my regard,
1 5277 Of the unworthiest siege.
1 5278 
1 5279 Laer.
1 5280 What part is that, my lord?
1 5281 
1 5282 King.
1 5283 A very riband in the cap of youth,
1 5284 Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
1 5285 The light and careless livery that it wears
1 5286 Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
1 5287 Importing health and graveness.--Two months since,
1 5288 Here was a gentleman of Normandy,--
1 5289 I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
1 5290 And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
1 5291 Had witchcraft in't: he grew unto his seat;
1 5292 And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
1 5293 As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
1 5294 With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought
1 5295 That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
1 5296 Come short of what he did.
1 5297 
1 5298 Laer.
1 5299 A Norman was't?
1 5300 
1 5301 King.
1 5302 A Norman.
1 5303 
1 5304 Laer.
1 5305 Upon my life, Lamond.
1 5306 
1 5307 King.
1 5308 The very same.
1 5309 
1 5310 Laer.
1 5311 I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
1 5312 And gem of all the nation.
1 5313 
1 5314 King.
1 5315 He made confession of you;
1 5316 And gave you such a masterly report
1 5317 For art and exercise in your defence,
1 5318 And for your rapier most especially,
1 5319 That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed
1 5320 If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation
1 5321 He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
1 5322 If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
1 5323 Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
1 5324 That he could nothing do but wish and beg
1 5325 Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
1 5326 Now, out of this,--
1 5327 
1 5328 Laer.
1 5329 What out of this, my lord?
1 5330 
1 5331 King.
1 5332 Laertes, was your father dear to you?
1 5333 Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
1 5334 A face without a heart?
1 5335 
1 5336 Laer.
1 5337 Why ask you this?
1 5338 
1 5339 King.
1 5340 Not that I think you did not love your father;
1 5341 But that I know love is begun by time,
1 5342 And that I see, in passages of proof,
1 5343 Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
1 5344 There lives within the very flame of love
1 5345 A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
1 5346 And nothing is at a like goodness still;
1 5347 For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
1 5348 Dies in his own too much: that we would do,
1 5349 We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
1 5350 And hath abatements and delays as many
1 5351 As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
1 5352 And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
1 5353 That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer:--
1 5354 Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake
1 5355 To show yourself your father's son in deed
1 5356 More than in words?
1 5357 
1 5358 Laer.
1 5359 To cut his throat i' the church.
1 5360 
1 5361 King.
1 5362 No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
1 5363 Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
1 5364 Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
1 5365 Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
1 5366 We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
1 5367 And set a double varnish on the fame
1 5368 The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
1 5369 And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
1 5370 Most generous, and free from all contriving,
1 5371 Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
1 5372 Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
1 5373 A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
1 5374 Requite him for your father.
1 5375 
1 5376 Laer.
1 5377 I will do't:
1 5378 And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
1 5379 I bought an unction of a mountebank,
1 5380 So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
1 5381 Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
1 5382 Collected from all simples that have virtue
1 5383 Under the moon, can save the thing from death
1 5384 This is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
1 5385 With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
1 5386 It may be death.
1 5387 
1 5388 King.
1 5389 Let's further think of this;
1 5390 Weigh what convenience both of time and means
1 5391 May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
1 5392 And that our drift look through our bad performance.
1 5393 'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
1 5394 Should have a back or second, that might hold
1 5395 If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see:--
1 5396 We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,--
1 5397 I ha't:
1 5398 When in your motion you are hot and dry,--
1 5399 As make your bouts more violent to that end,--
1 5400 And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
1 5401 A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
1 5402 If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
1 5403 Our purpose may hold there.
1 5404 
1 5405 [Enter Queen.]
1 5406 
1 5407 How now, sweet queen!
1 5408 
1 5409 Queen.
1 5410 One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
1 5411 So fast they follow:--your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
1 5412 
1 5413 Laer.
1 5414 Drown'd! O, where?
1 5415 
1 5416 Queen.
1 5417 There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
1 5418 That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
1 5419 There with fantastic garlands did she come
1 5420 Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
1 5421 That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
1 5422 But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
1 5423 There, on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
1 5424 Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke;
1 5425 When down her weedy trophies and herself
1 5426 Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
1 5427 And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
1 5428 Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes;
1 5429 As one incapable of her own distress,
1 5430 Or like a creature native and indu'd
1 5431 Unto that element: but long it could not be
1 5432 Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
1 5433 Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
1 5434 To muddy death.
1 5435 
1 5436 Laer.
1 5437 Alas, then she is drown'd?
1 5438 
1 5439 Queen.
1 5440 Drown'd, drown'd.
1 5441 
1 5442 Laer.
1 5443 Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
1 5444 And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
1 5445 It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
1 5446 Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
1 5447 The woman will be out.--Adieu, my lord:
1 5448 I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
1 5449 But that this folly douts it.
1 5450 
1 5451 [Exit.]
1 5452 
1 5453 King.
1 5454 Let's follow, Gertrude;
1 5455 How much I had to do to calm his rage!
1 5456 Now fear I this will give it start again;
1 5457 Therefore let's follow.

1 5463 ACT V.
1 5464 
1 5465 Scene I. A churchyard.
1 5466 
1 5467 [Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c.]
1 5468 
1 5469 1 Clown.
1 5470 Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
1 5471 seeks her own salvation?
1 5472 
1 5473 2 Clown.
1 5474 I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the
1 5475 crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.
1 5476 
1 5477 1 Clown.
1 5478 How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?
1 5479 
1 5480 2 Clown.
1 5481 Why, 'tis found so.
1 5482 
1 5483 1 Clown.
1 5484 It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
1 5485 the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an
1 5486 act hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:
1 5487 argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
1 5488 
1 5489 2 Clown.
1 5490 Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
1 5491 
1 5492 1 Clown.
1 5493 Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the
1 5494 man; good: if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
1 5495 will he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that: but if the water come
1 5496 to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is
1 5497 not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
1 5498 
1 5499 2 Clown.
1 5500 But is this law?
1 5501 
1 5502 1 Clown.
1 5503 Ay, marry, is't--crowner's quest law.
1 5504 
1 5505 2 Clown.
1 5506 Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a
1 5507 gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
1 5508 
1 5509 1 Clown.
1 5510 Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk
1 5511 should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves
1 5512 more than their even Christian.--Come, my spade. There is no
1 5513 ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they
1 5514 hold up Adam's profession.
1 5515 
1 5516 2 Clown.
1 5517 Was he a gentleman?
1 5518 
1 5519 1 Clown.
1 5520 He was the first that ever bore arms.
1 5521 
1 5522 2 Clown.
1 5523 Why, he had none.
1 5524 
1 5525 1 Clown.
1 5526 What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
1 5527 The Scripture says Adam digg'd: could he dig without arms? I'll
1 5528 put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
1 5529 purpose, confess thyself,--
1 5530 
1 5531 2 Clown.
1 5532 Go to.
1 5533 
1 5534 1 Clown.
1 5535 What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
1 5536 shipwright, or the carpenter?
1 5537 
1 5538 2 Clown.
1 5539 The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
1 5540 
1 5541 1 Clown.
1 5542 I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;
1 5543 but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now,
1 5544 thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
1 5545 church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
1 5546 
1 5547 2 Clown.
1 5548 Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
1 5549 
1 5550 1 Clown.
1 5551 Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
1 5552 
1 5553 2 Clown.
1 5554 Marry, now I can tell.
1 5555 
1 5556 1 Clown.
1 5557 To't.
1 5558 
1 5559 2 Clown.
1 5560 Mass, I cannot tell.
1 5561 
1 5562 [Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.]
1 5563 
1 5564 1 Clown.
1 5565 Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
1 5566 not mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this
1 5567 question next, say 'a grave-maker;' the houses he makes last
1 5568 till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
1 5569 liquor.
1 5570 
1 5571 [Exit Second Clown.]
1 5572 
1 5573 [Digs and sings.]
1 5574 
1 5575    In youth when I did love, did love,
1 5576      Methought it was very sweet;
1 5577    To contract, O, the time for, ah, my behove,
1 5578      O, methought there was nothing meet.
1 5579 
1 5580 Ham.
1 5581 Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
1 5582 grave-making?
1 5583 
1 5584 Hor.
1 5585 Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
1 5586 
1 5587 Ham.
1 5588 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier
1 5589 sense.
1 5590 
1 5591 1 Clown.
1 5592 [Sings.]
1 5593    But age, with his stealing steps,
1 5594      Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
1 5595    And hath shipp'd me into the land,
1 5596      As if I had never been such.
1 5597 
1 5598 [Throws up a skull.]
1 5599 
1 5600 Ham.
1 5601 That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the
1 5602 knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
1 5603 did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician,
1 5604 which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
1 5605 might it not?
1 5606 
1 5607 Hor.
1 5608 It might, my lord.
1 5609 
1 5610 Ham.
1 5611 Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
1 5612 How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that
1 5613 praised my lord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg
1 5614 it,--might it not?
1 5615 
1 5616 Hor.
1 5617 Ay, my lord.
1 5618 
1 5619 Ham.
1 5620 Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked
1 5621 about the mazard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution,
1 5622 an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
1 5623 breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? mine ache to think
1 5624 on't.
1 5625 
1 5626 1 Clown.
1 5627 [Sings.]
1 5628    A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
1 5629      For and a shrouding sheet;
1 5630    O, a pit of clay for to be made
1 5631      For such a guest is meet.
1 5632 
1 5633 [Throws up another skull].
1 5634 
1 5635 Ham.
1 5636 There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
1 5637 Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
1 5638 and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
1 5639 him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
1 5640 of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
1 5641 great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
1 5642 fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of
1 5643 his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
1 5644 pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of
1 5645 his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
1 5646 of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
1 5647 scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no
1 5648 more, ha?
1 5649 
1 5650 Hor.
1 5651 Not a jot more, my lord.
1 5652 
1 5653 Ham.
1 5654 Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?
1 5655 
1 5656 Hor.
1 5657 Ay, my lord, And of calf-skins too.
1 5658 
1 5659 Ham.
1 5660 They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
1 5661 will speak to this fellow.--Whose grave's this, sir?
1 5662 
1 5663 1 Clown.
1 5664 Mine, sir.
1 5665 [Sings.]
1 5666    O, a pit of clay for to be made
1 5667      For such a guest is meet.
1 5668 
1 5669 Ham.
1 5670 I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
1 5671 
1 5672 1 Clown.
1 5673 You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part,
1 5674 I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
1 5675 
1 5676 Ham.
1 5677 Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for
1 5678 the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
1 5679 
1 5680 1 Clown.
1 5681 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 't will away again from me to you.
1 5682 
1 5683 Ham.
1 5684 What man dost thou dig it for?
1 5685 
1 5686 1 Clown.
1 5687 For no man, sir.
1 5688 
1 5689 Ham.
1 5690 What woman then?
1 5691 
1 5692 1 Clown.
1 5693 For none neither.
1 5694 
1 5695 Ham.
1 5696 Who is to be buried in't?
1 5697 
1 5698 1 Clown.
1 5699 One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
1 5700 
1 5701 Ham.
1 5702 How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
1 5703 equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three
1 5704 years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that
1 5705 the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
1 5706 galls his kibe.--How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
1 5707 
1 5708 1 Clown.
1 5709 Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our
1 5710 last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
1 5711 
1 5712 Ham.
1 5713 How long is that since?
1 5714 
1 5715 1 Clown.
1 5716 Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the
1 5717 very day that young Hamlet was born,--he that is mad, and sent
1 5718 into England.
1 5719 
1 5720 Ham.
1 5721 Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
1 5722 
1 5723 1 Clown.
1 5724 Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;
1 5725 or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
1 5726 
1 5727 Ham.
1 5728 Why?
1 5729 
1 5730 1 Clown.
1 5731 'Twill not he seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.
1 5732 
1 5733 Ham.
1 5734 How came he mad?
1 5735 
1 5736 1 Clown.
1 5737 Very strangely, they say.
1 5738 
1 5739 Ham.
1 5740 How strangely?
1 5741 
1 5742 1 Clown.
1 5743 Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
1 5744 
1 5745 Ham.
1 5746 Upon what ground?
1 5747 
1 5748 1 Clown.
1 5749 Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy,
1 5750 thirty years.
1 5751 
1 5752 Ham.
1 5753 How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
1 5754 
1 5755 1 Clown.
1 5756 Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,--as we have many
1 5757 pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,--he
1 5758 will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last
1 5759 you nine year.
1 5760 
1 5761 Ham.
1 5762 Why he more than another?
1 5763 
1 5764 1 Clown.
1 5765 Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that he will
1 5766 keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
1 5767 your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain
1 5768 in the earth three-and-twenty years.
1 5769 
1 5770 Ham.
1 5771 Whose was it?
1 5772 
1 5773 1 Clown.
1 5774 A whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
1 5775 
1 5776 Ham.
1 5777 Nay, I know not.
1 5778 
1 5779 1 Clown.
1 5780 A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
1 5781 Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
1 5782 skull, the king's jester.
1 5783 
1 5784 Ham.
1 5785 This?
1 5786 
1 5787 1 Clown.
1 5788 E'en that.
1 5789 
1 5790 Ham.
1 5791 Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick!--I knew him,
1 5792 Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he
1 5793 hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred
1 5794 in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those
1 5795 lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
1 5796 now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that
1 5797 were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
1 5798 own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now, get you to my lady's
1 5799 chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
1 5800 favour she must come; make her laugh at that.--Pr'ythee, Horatio,
1 5801 tell me one thing.
1 5802 
1 5803 Hor.
1 5804 What's that, my lord?
1 5805 
1 5806 Ham.
1 5807 Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?
1 5808 
1 5809 Hor.
1 5810 E'en so.
1 5811 
1 5812 Ham.
1 5813 And smelt so? Pah!
1 5814 
1 5815 [Throws down the skull.]
1 5816 
1 5817 Hor.
1 5818 E'en so, my lord.
1 5819 
1 5820 Ham.
1 5821 To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
1 5822 imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
1 5823 stopping a bung-hole?
1 5824 
1 5825 Hor.
1 5826 'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.
1 5827 
1 5828 Ham.
1 5829 No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
1 5830 enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died,
1 5831 Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
1 5832 earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he
1 5833 was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?
1 5834    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
1 5835    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
1 5836    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
1 5837    Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
1 5838 But soft! but soft! aside!--Here comes the king.
1 5839 
1 5840 [Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia,
1 5841 Laertes, and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.]
1 5842 
1 5843 The queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?
1 5844 And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
1 5845 The corse they follow did with desperate hand
1 5846 Fordo it own life: 'twas of some estate.
1 5847 Couch we awhile and mark.
1 5848 
1 5849 [Retiring with Horatio.]
1 5850 
1 5851 Laer.
1 5852 What ceremony else?
1 5853 
1 5854 Ham.
1 5855 That is Laertes,
1 5856 A very noble youth: mark.
1 5857 
1 5858 Laer.
1 5859 What ceremony else?
1 5860 
1 5861 1 Priest.
1 5862 Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
1 5863 As we have warranties: her death was doubtful;
1 5864 And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
1 5865 She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
1 5866 Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
1 5867 Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,
1 5868 Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
1 5869 Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
1 5870 Of bell and burial.
1 5871 
1 5872 Laer.
1 5873 Must there no more be done?
1 5874 
1 5875 1 Priest.
1 5876 No more be done;
1 5877 We should profane the service of the dead
1 5878 To sing a requiem and such rest to her
1 5879 As to peace-parted souls.
1 5880 
1 5881 Laer.
1 5882 Lay her i' the earth;--
1 5883 And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
1 5884 May violets spring!--I tell thee, churlish priest,
1 5885 A ministering angel shall my sister be
1 5886 When thou liest howling.
1 5887 
1 5888 Ham.
1 5889 What, the fair Ophelia?
1 5890 
1 5891 Queen.
1 5892 Sweets to the sweet: farewell.
1 5893 [Scattering flowers.]
1 5894 I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
1 5895 I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
1 5896 And not have strew'd thy grave.
1 5897 
1 5898 Laer.
1 5899 O, treble woe
1 5900 Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
1 5901 Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
1 5902 Depriv'd thee of!--Hold off the earth awhile,
1 5903 Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
1 5904 [Leaps into the grave.]
1 5905 Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
1 5906 Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
1 5907 To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
1 5908 Of blue Olympus.
1 5909 
1 5910 Ham.
1 5911 [Advancing.]
1 5912 What is he whose grief
1 5913 Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
1 5914 Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
1 5915 Like wonder-wounded hearers? this is I,
1 5916 Hamlet the Dane.
1 5917 [Leaps into the grave.]
1 5918 
1 5919 Laer.
1 5920 The devil take thy soul!
1 5921 [Grappling with him.]
1 5922 
1 5923 Ham.
1 5924 Thou pray'st not well.
1 5925 I pr'ythee, take thy fingers from my throat;
1 5926 For, though I am not splenetive and rash,
1 5927 Yet have I in me something dangerous,
1 5928 Which let thy wiseness fear: away thy hand!
1 5929 
1 5930 King.
1 5931 Pluck them asunder.
1 5932 
1 5933 Queen.
1 5934 Hamlet! Hamlet!
1 5935 
1 5936 All.
1 5937 Gentlemen!--
1 5938 
1 5939 Hor.
1 5940 Good my lord, be quiet.
1 5941 
1 5942 [The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.]
1 5943 
1 5944 Ham.
1 5945 Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
1 5946 Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
1 5947 
1 5948 Queen.
1 5949 O my son, what theme?
1 5950 
1 5951 Ham.
1 5952 I lov'd Ophelia; forty thousand brothers
1 5953 Could not, with all their quantity of love,
1 5954 Make up my sum.--What wilt thou do for her?
1 5955 
1 5956 King.
1 5957 O, he is mad, Laertes.
1 5958 
1 5959 Queen.
1 5960 For love of God, forbear him!
1 5961 
1 5962 Ham.
1 5963 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
1 5964 Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
1 5965 Woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
1 5966 I'll do't.--Dost thou come here to whine?
1 5967 To outface me with leaping in her grave?
1 5968 Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
1 5969 And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
1 5970 Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
1 5971 Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
1 5972 Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
1 5973 I'll rant as well as thou.
1 5974 
1 5975 Queen.
1 5976 This is mere madness:
1 5977 And thus a while the fit will work on him;
1 5978 Anon, as patient as the female dove,
1 5979 When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
1 5980 His silence will sit drooping.
1 5981 
1 5982 Ham.
1 5983 Hear you, sir;
1 5984 What is the reason that you use me thus?
1 5985 I lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;
1 5986 Let Hercules himself do what he may,
1 5987 The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
1 5988 
1 5989 [Exit.]
1 5990 
1 5991 King.
1 5992 I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.--
1 5993 
1 5994 [Exit Horatio.]
1 5995 [To Laertes]
1 5996 Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
1 5997 We'll put the matter to the present push.--
1 5998 Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.--
1 5999 This grave shall have a living monument:
1 6000 An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
1 6001 Till then in patience our proceeding be.
1 6002 
1 6003 [Exeunt.]
1 6004 
1 6005 
1 6006 
1 6007 Scene II. A hall in the Castle.
1 6008 
1 6009 [Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]
1 6010 
1 6011 Ham.
1 6012 So much for this, sir: now let me see the other;
1 6013 You do remember all the circumstance?
1 6014 
1 6015 Hor.
1 6016 Remember it, my lord!
1 6017 
1 6018 Ham.
1 6019 Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
1 6020 That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
1 6021 Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,
1 6022 And prais'd be rashness for it,--let us know,
1 6023 Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,
1 6024 When our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us
1 6025 There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
1 6026 Rough-hew them how we will.
1 6027 
1 6028 Hor.
1 6029 That is most certain.
1 6030 
1 6031 Ham.
1 6032 Up from my cabin,
1 6033 My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
1 6034 Grop'd I to find out them: had my desire;
1 6035 Finger'd their packet; and, in fine, withdrew
1 6036 To mine own room again: making so bold,
1 6037 My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
1 6038 Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
1 6039 O royal knavery! an exact command,--
1 6040 Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
1 6041 Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
1 6042 With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,--
1 6043 That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
1 6044 No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
1 6045 My head should be struck off.
1 6046 
1 6047 Hor.
1 6048 Is't possible?
1 6049 
1 6050 Ham.
1 6051 Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
1 6052 But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
1 6053 
1 6054 Hor.
1 6055 I beseech you.
1 6056 
1 6057 Ham.
1 6058 Being thus benetted round with villanies,--
1 6059 Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
1 6060 They had begun the play,--I sat me down;
1 6061 Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair:
1 6062 I once did hold it, as our statists do,
1 6063 A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
1 6064 How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
1 6065 It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
1 6066 The effect of what I wrote?
1 6067 
1 6068 Hor.
1 6069 Ay, good my lord.
1 6070 
1 6071 Ham.
1 6072 An earnest conjuration from the king,--
1 6073 As England was his faithful tributary;
1 6074 As love between them like the palm might flourish;
1 6075 As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
1 6076 And stand a comma 'tween their amities;
1 6077 And many such-like as's of great charge,--
1 6078 That, on the view and know of these contents,
1 6079 Without debatement further, more or less,
1 6080 He should the bearers put to sudden death,
1 6081 Not shriving-time allow'd.
1 6082 
1 6083 Hor.
1 6084 How was this seal'd?
1 6085 
1 6086 Ham.
1 6087 Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
1 6088 I had my father's signet in my purse,
1 6089 Which was the model of that Danish seal:
1 6090 Folded the writ up in the form of the other;
1 6091 Subscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,
1 6092 The changeling never known. Now, the next day
1 6093 Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
1 6094 Thou know'st already.
1 6095 
1 6096 Hor.
1 6097 So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
1 6098 
1 6099 Ham.
1 6100 Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
1 6101 They are not near my conscience; their defeat
1 6102 Does by their own insinuation grow:
1 6103 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
1 6104 Between the pass and fell incensed points
1 6105 Of mighty opposites.
1 6106 
1 6107 Hor.
1 6108 Why, what a king is this!
1 6109 
1 6110 Ham.
1 6111 Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon,--
1 6112 He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
1 6113 Popp'd in between the election and my hopes;
1 6114 Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
1 6115 And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience
1 6116 To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd
1 6117 To let this canker of our nature come
1 6118 In further evil?
1 6119 
1 6120 Hor.
1 6121 It must be shortly known to him from England
1 6122 What is the issue of the business there.
1 6123 
1 6124 Ham.
1 6125 It will be short: the interim is mine;
1 6126 And a man's life is no more than to say One.
1 6127 But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
1 6128 That to Laertes I forgot myself;
1 6129 For by the image of my cause I see
1 6130 The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:
1 6131 But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
1 6132 Into a towering passion.
1 6133 
1 6134 Hor.
1 6135 Peace; who comes here?
1 6136 
1 6137 [Enter Osric.]
1 6138 
1 6139 Osr.
1 6140 Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
1 6141 
1 6142 Ham.
1 6143 I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
1 6144 
1 6145 Hor.
1 6146 No, my good lord.
1 6147 
1 6148 Ham.
1 6149 Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He
1 6150 hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and
1 6151 his crib shall stand at the king's mess; 'tis a chough; but, as I
1 6152 say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
1 6153 
1 6154 Osr.
1 6155 Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
1 6156 impart a thing to you from his majesty.
1 6157 
1 6158 Ham.
1 6159 I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your
1 6160 bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
1 6161 
1 6162 Osr.
1 6163 I thank your lordship, t'is very hot.
1 6164 
1 6165 Ham.
1 6166 No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
1 6167 
1 6168 Osr.
1 6169 It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
1 6170 
1 6171 Ham.
1 6172 Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
1 6173 
1 6174 Osr.
1 6175 Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as 'twere--I cannot
1 6176 tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that
1 6177 he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
1 6178 matter,--
1 6179 
1 6180 Ham.
1 6181 I beseech you, remember,--
1 6182 [Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
1 6183 
1 6184 Osr.
1 6185 Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
1 6186 is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
1 6187 gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft
1 6188 society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he
1 6189 is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
1 6190 continent of what part a gentleman would see.
1 6191 
1 6192 Ham.
1 6193 Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;--though, I
1 6194 know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of
1 6195 memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
1 6196 But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
1 6197 article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
1 6198 true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
1 6199 would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
1 6200 
1 6201 Osr.
1 6202 Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
1 6203 
1 6204 Ham.
1 6205 The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
1 6206 rawer breath?
1 6207 
1 6208 Osr.
1 6209 Sir?
1 6210 
1 6211 Hor.
1 6212 Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,
1 6213 sir, really.
1 6214 
1 6215 Ham.
1 6216 What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
1 6217 
1 6218 Osr.
1 6219 Of Laertes?
1 6220 
1 6221 Hor.
1 6222 His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
1 6223 
1 6224 Ham.
1 6225 Of him, sir.
1 6226 
1 6227 Osr.
1 6228 I know, you are not ignorant,--
1 6229 
1 6230 Ham.
1 6231 I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
1 6232 much approve me.--Well, sir.
1 6233 
1 6234 Osr.
1 6235 You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,--
1 6236 
1 6237 Ham.
1 6238 I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
1 6239 excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
1 6240 
1 6241 Osr.
1 6242 I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
1 6243 him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
1 6244 
1 6245 Ham.
1 6246 What's his weapon?
1 6247 
1 6248 Osr.
1 6249 Rapier and dagger.
1 6250 
1 6251 Ham.
1 6252 That's two of his weapons:--but well.
1 6253 
1 6254 Osr.
1 6255 The king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:
1 6256 against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French
1 6257 rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
1 6258 so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
1 6259 very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
1 6260 very liberal conceit.
1 6261 
1 6262 Ham.
1 6263 What call you the carriages?
1 6264 
1 6265 Hor.
1 6266 I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
1 6267 
1 6268 Osr.
1 6269 The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
1 6270 
1 6271 Ham.
1 6272 The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could
1 6273 carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.
1 6274 But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
1 6275 assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that's the French
1 6276 bet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?
1 6277 
1 6278 Osr.
1 6279 The king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
1 6280 your and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath
1 6281 laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial
1 6282 if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
1 6283 
1 6284 Ham.
1 6285 How if I answer no?
1 6286 
1 6287 Osr.
1 6288 I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
1 6289 
1 6290 Ham.
1 6291 Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,
1 6292 it is the breathing time of day with me: let the foils be
1 6293 brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,
1 6294 I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
1 6295 shame and the odd hits.
1 6296 
1 6297 Osr.
1 6298 Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
1 6299 
1 6300 Ham.
1 6301 To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
1 6302 
1 6303 Osr.
1 6304 I commend my duty to your lordship.
1 6305 
1 6306 Ham.
1 6307 Yours, yours.
1 6308 
1 6309 [Exit Osric.]
1 6310 
1 6311 He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else
1 6312 for's turn.
1 6313 
1 6314 Hor.
1 6315 This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
1 6316 
1 6317 Ham.
1 6318 He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,--and
1 6319 many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,--
1 6320 only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;
1 6321 a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
1 6322 through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
1 6323 them to their trial, the bubbles are out,
1 6324 
1 6325 [Enter a Lord.]
1 6326 
1 6327 Lord.
1 6328 My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
1 6329 who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends
1 6330 to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
1 6331 will take longer time.
1 6332 
1 6333 Ham.
1 6334 I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:
1 6335 if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
1 6336 I be so able as now.
1 6337 
1 6338 Lord.
1 6339 The King and Queen and all are coming down.
1 6340 
1 6341 Ham.
1 6342 In happy time.
1 6343 
1 6344 Lord.
1 6345 The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
1 6346 Laertes before you fall to play.
1 6347 
1 6348 Ham.
1 6349 She well instructs me.
1 6350 
1 6351 [Exit Lord.]
1 6352 
1 6353 Hor.
1 6354 You will lose this wager, my lord.
1 6355 
1 6356 Ham.
1 6357 I do not think so; since he went into France I have been in
1 6358 continual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
1 6359 think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.
1 6360 
1 6361 Hor.
1 6362 Nay, good my lord,--
1 6363 
1 6364 Ham.
1 6365 It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as
1 6366 would perhaps trouble a woman.
1 6367 
1 6368 Hor.
1 6369 If your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will forestall their
1 6370 repair hither, and say you are not fit.
1 6371 
1 6372 Ham.
1 6373 Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in
1 6374 the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be
1 6375 not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
1 6376 the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves,
1 6377 what is't to leave betimes?
1 6378 
1 6379 [Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with
1 6380 foils &c.]
1 6381 
1 6382 King.
1 6383 Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
1 6384 
1 6385 [The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
1 6386 
1 6387 Ham.
1 6388 Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong:
1 6389 But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
1 6390 This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,
1 6391 How I am punish'd with sore distraction.
1 6392 What I have done
1 6393 That might your nature, honour, and exception
1 6394 Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
1 6395 Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
1 6396 If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
1 6397 And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
1 6398 Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
1 6399 Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
1 6400 Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
1 6401 His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
1 6402 Sir, in this audience,
1 6403 Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
1 6404 Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
1 6405 That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
1 6406 And hurt my brother.
1 6407 
1 6408 Laer.
1 6409 I am satisfied in nature,
1 6410 Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
1 6411 To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
1 6412 I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement
1 6413 Till by some elder masters of known honour
1 6414 I have a voice and precedent of peace
1 6415 To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
1 6416 I do receive your offer'd love like love,
1 6417 And will not wrong it.
1 6418 
1 6419 Ham.
1 6420 I embrace it freely;
1 6421 And will this brother's wager frankly play.--
1 6422 Give us the foils; come on.
1 6423 
1 6424 Laer.
1 6425 Come, one for me.
1 6426 
1 6427 Ham.
1 6428 I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
1 6429 Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,
1 6430 Stick fiery off indeed.
1 6431 
1 6432 Laer.
1 6433 You mock me, sir.
1 6434 
1 6435 Ham.
1 6436 No, by this hand.
1 6437 
1 6438 King.
1 6439 Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
1 6440 You know the wager?
1 6441 
1 6442 Ham.
1 6443 Very well, my lord;
1 6444 Your grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.
1 6445 
1 6446 King.
1 6447 I do not fear it; I have seen you both;
1 6448 But since he's better'd, we have therefore odds.
1 6449 
1 6450 Laer.
1 6451 This is too heavy, let me see another.
1 6452 
1 6453 Ham.
1 6454 This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
1 6455 
1 6456 [They prepare to play.]
1 6457 
1 6458 Osr.
1 6459 Ay, my good lord.
1 6460 
1 6461 King.
1 6462 Set me the stoups of wine upon that table,--
1 6463 If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
1 6464 Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
1 6465 Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
1 6466 The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
1 6467 And in the cup an union shall he throw,
1 6468 Richer than that which four successive kings
1 6469 In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
1 6470 And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
1 6471 The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
1 6472 The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
1 6473 'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.'--Come, begin:--
1 6474 And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
1 6475 
1 6476 Ham.
1 6477 Come on, sir.
1 6478 
1 6479 Laer.
1 6480 Come, my lord.
1 6481 
1 6482 [They play.]
1 6483 
1 6484 Ham.
1 6485 One.
1 6486 
1 6487 Laer.
1 6488 No.
1 6489 
1 6490 Ham.
1 6491 Judgment!
1 6492 
1 6493 Osr.
1 6494 A hit, a very palpable hit.
1 6495 
1 6496 Laer.
1 6497 Well;--again.
1 6498 
1 6499 King.
1 6500 Stay, give me drink.--Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
1 6501 Here's to thy health.--
1 6502 
1 6503 [Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.]
1 6504 
1 6505 Give him the cup.
1 6506 
1 6507 Ham.
1 6508 I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.--
1 6509 Come.--Another hit; what say you?
1 6510 
1 6511 [They play.]
1 6512 
1 6513 Laer.
1 6514 A touch, a touch, I do confess.
1 6515 
1 6516 King.
1 6517 Our son shall win.
1 6518 
1 6519 Queen.
1 6520 He's fat, and scant of breath.--
1 6521 Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:
1 6522 The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
1 6523 
1 6524 Ham.
1 6525 Good madam!
1 6526 
1 6527 King.
1 6528 Gertrude, do not drink.
1 6529 
1 6530 Queen.
1 6531 I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
1 6532 
1 6533 King.
1 6534 [Aside.] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
1 6535 
1 6536 Ham.
1 6537 I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
1 6538 
1 6539 Queen.
1 6540 Come, let me wipe thy face.
1 6541 
1 6542 Laer.
1 6543 My lord, I'll hit him now.
1 6544 
1 6545 King.
1 6546 I do not think't.
1 6547 
1 6548 Laer.
1 6549 [Aside.] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
1 6550 
1 6551 Ham.
1 6552 Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
1 6553 I pray you pass with your best violence:
1 6554 I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
1 6555 
1 6556 Laer.
1 6557 Say you so? come on.
1 6558 
1 6559 [They play.]
1 6560 
1 6561 Osr.
1 6562 Nothing, neither way.
1 6563 
1 6564 Laer.
1 6565 Have at you now!
1 6566 
1 6567 [Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they
1 6568 change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]
1 6569 
1 6570 King.
1 6571 Part them; they are incens'd.
1 6572 
1 6573 Ham.
1 6574 Nay, come again!
1 6575 
1 6576 [The Queen falls.]
1 6577 
1 6578 Osr.
1 6579 Look to the queen there, ho!
1 6580 
1 6581 Hor.
1 6582 They bleed on both sides.--How is it, my lord?
1 6583 
1 6584 Osr.
1 6585 How is't, Laertes?
1 6586 
1 6587 Laer.
1 6588 Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;
1 6589 I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
1 6590 
1 6591 Ham.
1 6592 How does the Queen?
1 6593 
1 6594 King.
1 6595 She swoons to see them bleed.
1 6596 
1 6597 Queen.
1 6598 No, no! the drink, the drink!--O my dear Hamlet!--
1 6599 The drink, the drink!--I am poison'd.
1 6600 
1 6601 [Dies.]
1 6602 
1 6603 Ham.
1 6604 O villany!--Ho! let the door be lock'd:
1 6605 Treachery! seek it out.
1 6606 
1 6607 [Laertes falls.]
1 6608 
1 6609 Laer.
1 6610 It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
1 6611 No medicine in the world can do thee good;
1 6612 In thee there is not half an hour of life;
1 6613 The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
1 6614 Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice
1 6615 Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
1 6616 Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
1 6617 I can no more:--the king, the king's to blame.
1 6618 
1 6619 Ham.
1 6620 The point envenom'd too!--
1 6621 Then, venom, to thy work.
1 6622 
1 6623 [Stabs the King.]
1 6624 
1 6625 Osric and Lords.
1 6626 Treason! treason!
1 6627 
1 6628 King.
1 6629 O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
1 6630 
1 6631 Ham.
1 6632 Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
1 6633 Drink off this potion.--Is thy union here?
1 6634 Follow my mother.
1 6635 
1 6636 [King dies.]
1 6637 
1 6638 Laer.
1 6639 He is justly serv'd;
1 6640 It is a poison temper'd by himself.--
1 6641 Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
1 6642 Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
1 6643 Nor thine on me!
1 6644 
1 6645 [Dies.]
1 6646 
1 6647 Ham.
1 6648 Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.--
1 6649 I am dead, Horatio.--Wretched queen, adieu!--
1 6650 You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
1 6651 That are but mutes or audience to this act,
1 6652 Had I but time,--as this fell sergeant, death,
1 6653 Is strict in his arrest,--O, I could tell you,--
1 6654 But let it be.--Horatio, I am dead;
1 6655 Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
1 6656 To the unsatisfied.
1 6657 
1 6658 Hor.
1 6659 Never believe it:
1 6660 I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.--
1 6661 Here's yet some liquor left.
1 6662 
1 6663 Ham.
1 6664 As thou'rt a man,
1 6665 Give me the cup; let go; by heaven, I'll have't.--
1 6666 O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
1 6667 Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
1 6668 If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
1 6669 Absent thee from felicity awhile,
1 6670 And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
1 6671 To tell my story.--
1 6672 
1 6673 [March afar off, and shot within.]
1 6674 
1 6675 What warlike noise is this?
1 6676 
1 6677 Osr.
1 6678 Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
1 6679 To the ambassadors of England gives
1 6680 This warlike volley.
1 6681 
1 6682 Ham.
1 6683 O, I die, Horatio;
1 6684 The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
1 6685 I cannot live to hear the news from England;
1 6686 But I do prophesy the election lights
1 6687 On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
1 6688 So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
1 6689 Which have solicited.--the rest is silence.
1 6690 
1 6691 [Dies.]
1 6692 
1 6693 Hor.
1 6694 Now cracks a noble heart.--Good night, sweet prince,
1 6695 And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
1 6696 Why does the drum come hither?
1 6697 
1 6698 [March within.]
1 6699 
1 6700 [Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors, and others.]
1 6701 
1 6702 Fort.
1 6703 Where is this sight?
1 6704 
1 6705 Hor.
1 6706 What is it you will see?
1 6707 If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
1 6708 
1 6709 Fort.
1 6710 This quarry cries on havoc.--O proud death,
1 6711 What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
1 6712 That thou so many princes at a shot
1 6713 So bloodily hast struck?
1 6714 
1 6715 1 Ambassador.
1 6716 The sight is dismal;
1 6717 And our affairs from England come too late:
1 6718 The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
1 6719 To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
1 6720 That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
1 6721 Where should we have our thanks?
1 6722 
1 6723 Hor.
1 6724 Not from his mouth,
1 6725 Had it the ability of life to thank you:
1 6726 He never gave commandment for their death.
1 6727 But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
1 6728 You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
1 6729 Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
1 6730 High on a stage be placed to the view;
1 6731 And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
1 6732 How these things came about: so shall you hear
1 6733 Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
1 6734 Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
1 6735 Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
1 6736 And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
1 6737 Fall'n on the inventors' heads: all this can I
1 6738 Truly deliver.
1 6739 
1 6740 Fort.
1 6741 Let us haste to hear it,
1 6742 And call the noblest to the audience.
1 6743 For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
1 6744 I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
1 6745 Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
1 6746 
1 6747 Hor.
1 6748 Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
1 6749 And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
1 6750 But let this same be presently perform'd,
1 6751 Even while men's minds are wild: lest more mischance
1 6752 On plots and errors happen.
1 6753 
1 6754 Fort.
1 6755 Let four captains
1 6756 Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
1 6757 For he was likely, had he been put on,
1 6758 To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage,
1 6759 The soldiers' music and the rites of war
1 6760 Speak loudly for him.--
1 6761 Take up the bodies.--Such a sight as this
1 6762 Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
1 6763 Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
1 6764 
1 6765 [A dead march.]
1 6766 
1 6767 [Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after the which a peal of
1 6768 ordnance is shot off.]
