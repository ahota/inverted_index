3 1 
3 2 Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
3 3 
3 4 Thunder and Lightning. Enter three Witches.
3 5 
3 6   1. When shall we three meet againe?
3 7 In Thunder, Lightning, or in Raine?
3 8   2. When the Hurley-burley's done,
3 9 When the Battaile's lost, and wonne
3 10 
3 11    3. That will be ere the set of Sunne
3 12 
3 13    1. Where the place?
3 14   2. Vpon the Heath
3 15 
3 16    3. There to meet with Macbeth
3 17 
3 18    1. I come, Gray-Malkin
3 19 
3 20    All. Padock calls anon: faire is foule, and foule is faire,
3 21 Houer through the fogge and filthie ayre.
3 22 
3 23 Exeunt.
3 24 
3 25 
3 26 Scena Secunda.
3 27 
3 28 Alarum within. Enter King Malcome, Donalbaine, Lenox, with
3 29 attendants,
3 30 meeting a bleeding Captaine.
3 31 
3 32   King. What bloody man is that? he can report,
3 33 As seemeth by his plight, of the Reuolt
3 34 The newest state
3 35 
3 36    Mal. This is the Serieant,
3 37 Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought
3 38 'Gainst my Captiuitie: Haile braue friend;
3 39 Say to the King, the knowledge of the Broyle,
3 40 As thou didst leaue it
3 41 
3 42    Cap. Doubtfull it stood,
3 43 As two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,
3 44 And choake their Art: The mercilesse Macdonwald
3 45 (Worthie to be a Rebell, for to that
3 46 The multiplying Villanies of Nature
3 47 Doe swarme vpon him) from the Westerne Isles
3 48 Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,
3 49 And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,
3 50 Shew'd like a Rebells Whore: but all's too weake:
3 51 For braue Macbeth (well hee deserues that Name)
3 52 Disdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,
3 53 Which smoak'd with bloody execution
3 54 (Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,
3 55 Till hee fac'd the Slaue:
3 56 Which neu'r shooke hands, nor bad farwell to him,
3 57 Till he vnseam'd him from the Naue toth' Chops,
3 58 And fix'd his Head vpon our Battlements
3 59 
3 60    King. O valiant Cousin, worthy Gentleman
3 61 
3 62    Cap. As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,
3 63 Shipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:
3 64 So from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,
3 65 Discomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,
3 66 No sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,
3 67 Compell'd these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles,
3 68 But the Norweyan Lord, surueying vantage,
3 69 With furbusht Armes, and new supplyes of men,
3 70 Began a fresh assault
3 71 
3 72    King. Dismay'd not this our Captaines, Macbeth and
3 73 Banquoh?
3 74   Cap. Yes, as Sparrowes, Eagles;
3 75 Or the Hare, the Lyon:
3 76 If I say sooth, I must report they were
3 77 As Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,
3 78 So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:
3 79 Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,
3 80 Or memorize another Golgotha,
3 81 I cannot tell: but I am faint,
3 82 My Gashes cry for helpe
3 83 
3 84    King. So well thy words become thee, as thy wounds,
3 85 They smack of Honor both: Goe get him Surgeons.
3 86 Enter Rosse and Angus.
3 87 
3 88 Who comes here?
3 89   Mal. The worthy Thane of Rosse
3 90 
3 91    Lenox. What a haste lookes through his eyes?
3 92 So should he looke, that seemes to speake things strange
3 93 
3 94    Rosse. God saue the King
3 95 
3 96    King. Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane?
3 97   Rosse. From Fiffe, great King,
3 98 Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie,
3 99 And fanne our people cold.
3 100 Norway himselfe, with terrible numbers,
3 101 Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor,
3 102 The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismall Conflict,
3 103 Till that Bellona's Bridegroome, lapt in proofe,
3 104 Confronted him with selfe-comparisons,
3 105 Point against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,
3 106 Curbing his lauish spirit: and to conclude,
3 107 The Victorie fell on vs
3 108 
3 109    King. Great happinesse
3 110 
3 111    Rosse. That now Sweno, the Norwayes King,
3 112 Craues composition:
3 113 Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men,
3 114 Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes ynch,
3 115 Ten thousand Dollars, to our generall vse
3 116 
3 117    King. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue
3 118 Our Bosome interest: Goe pronounce his present death,
3 119 And with his former Title greet Macbeth
3 120 
3 121    Rosse. Ile see it done
3 122 
3 123    King. What he hath lost, Noble Macbeth hath wonne.
3 124 
3 125 Exeunt.
3 126 
3 127 
3 128 Scena Tertia.
3 129 
3 130 Thunder. Enter the three Witches.
3 131 
3 132   1. Where hast thou beene, Sister?
3 133   2. Killing Swine
3 134 
3 135    3. Sister, where thou?
3 136   1. A Saylors Wife had Chestnuts in her Lappe,
3 137 And mouncht, & mouncht, and mouncht:
3 138 Giue me, quoth I.
3 139 Aroynt thee, Witch, the rumpe-fed Ronyon cryes.
3 140 Her Husband's to Aleppo gone, Master o'th' Tiger:
3 141 But in a Syue Ile thither sayle,
3 142 And like a Rat without a tayle,
3 143 Ile doe, Ile doe, and Ile doe
3 144 
3 145    2. Ile giue thee a Winde
3 146 
3 147    1. Th'art kinde
3 148 
3 149    3. And I another
3 150 
3 151    1. I my selfe haue all the other,
3 152 And the very Ports they blow,
3 153 All the Quarters that they know,
3 154 I'th' Ship-mans Card.
3 155 Ile dreyne him drie as Hay:
3 156 Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day
3 157 Hang vpon his Pent-house Lid:
3 158 He shall liue a man forbid:
3 159 Wearie Seu'nights, nine times nine,
3 160 Shall he dwindle, peake, and pine:
3 161 Though his Barke cannot be lost,
3 162 Yet it shall be Tempest-tost.
3 163 Looke what I haue
3 164 
3 165    2. Shew me, shew me
3 166 
3 167    1. Here I haue a Pilots Thumbe,
3 168 Wrackt, as homeward he did come.
3 169 
3 170 Drum within.
3 171 
3 172   3. A Drumme, a Drumme:
3 173 Macbeth doth come
3 174 
3 175    All. The weyward Sisters, hand in hand,
3 176 Posters of the Sea and Land,
3 177 Thus doe goe, about, about,
3 178 Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
3 179 And thrice againe, to make vp nine.
3 180 Peace, the Charme's wound vp.
3 181 Enter Macbeth and Banquo.
3 182 
3 183   Macb. So foule and faire a day I haue not seene
3 184 
3 185    Banquo. How farre is't call'd to Soris? What are these,
3 186 So wither'd, and so wilde in their attyre,
3 187 That looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,
3 188 And yet are on't? Liue you, or are you aught
3 189 That man may question? you seeme to vnderstand me,
3 190 By each at once her choppie finger laying
3 191 Vpon her skinnie Lips: you should be Women,
3 192 And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete
3 193 That you are so
3 194 
3 195    Mac. Speake if you can: what are you?
3 196   1. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Glamis
3 197 
3 198    2. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Cawdor
3 199 
3 200    3. All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter
3 201 
3 202    Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare
3 203 Things that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth
3 204 Are ye fantasticall, or that indeed
3 205 Which outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner
3 206 You greet with present Grace, and great prediction
3 207 Of Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,
3 208 That he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.
3 209 If you can looke into the Seedes of Time,
3 210 And say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,
3 211 Speake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare
3 212 Your fauors, nor your hate
3 213 
3 214    1. Hayle
3 215 
3 216    2. Hayle
3 217 
3 218    3. Hayle
3 219 
3 220    1. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater
3 221 
3 222    2. Not so happy, yet much happyer
3 223 
3 224    3. Thou shalt get Kings, though thou be none:
3 225 So all haile Macbeth, and Banquo
3 226 
3 227    1. Banquo, and Macbeth, all haile
3 228 
3 229    Macb. Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:
3 230 By Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,
3 231 But how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liues
3 232 A prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,
3 233 Stands not within the prospect of beleefe,
3 234 No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence
3 235 You owe this strange Intelligence, or why
3 236 Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way
3 237 With such Prophetique greeting?
3 238 Speake, I charge you.
3 239 
3 240 Witches vanish.
3 241 
3 242   Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,
3 243 And these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?
3 244   Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,
3 245 Melted, as breath into the Winde.
3 246 Would they had stay'd
3 247 
3 248    Banq. Were such things here, as we doe speake about?
3 249 Or haue we eaten on the insane Root,
3 250 That takes the Reason Prisoner?
3 251   Macb. Your Children shall be Kings
3 252 
3 253    Banq. You shall be King
3 254 
3 255    Macb. And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
3 256   Banq. Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?
3 257 Enter Rosse and Angus.
3 258 
3 259   Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,
3 260 The newes of thy successe: and when he reades
3 261 Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,
3 262 His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,
3 263 Which should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,
3 264 In viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,
3 265 He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,
3 266 Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make
3 267 Strange Images of death, as thick as Tale
3 268 Can post with post, and euery one did beare
3 269 Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,
3 270 And powr'd them downe before him
3 271 
3 272    Ang. Wee are sent,
3 273 To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,
3 274 Onely to harrold thee into his sight,
3 275 Not pay thee
3 276 
3 277    Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,
3 278 He bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
3 279 In which addition, haile most worthy Thane,
3 280 For it is thine
3 281 
3 282    Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?
3 283   Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:
3 284 Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?
3 285   Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,
3 286 But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,
3 287 Which he deserues to loose.
3 288 Whether he was combin'd with those of Norway,
3 289 Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,
3 290 And vantage; or that with both he labour'd
3 291 In his Countreyes wracke, I know not:
3 292 But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,
3 293 Haue ouerthrowne him
3 294 
3 295    Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:
3 296 The greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.
3 297 Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,
3 298 When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,
3 299 Promis'd no lesse to them
3 300 
3 301    Banq. That trusted home,
3 302 Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,
3 303 Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
3 304 And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,
3 305 The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,
3 306 Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's
3 307 In deepest consequence.
3 308 Cousins, a word, I pray you
3 309 
3 310    Macb. Two Truths are told,
3 311 As happy Prologues to the swelling Act
3 312 Of the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:
3 313 This supernaturall solliciting
3 314 Cannot be ill; cannot be good.
3 315 If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,
3 316 Commencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
3 317 If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,
3 318 Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,
3 319 And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,
3 320 Against the vse of Nature? Present Feares
3 321 Are lesse then horrible Imaginings:
3 322 My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,
3 323 Shakes so my single state of Man,
3 324 That Function is smother'd in surmise,
3 325 And nothing is, but what is not
3 326 
3 327    Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt
3 328 
3 329    Macb. If Chance will haue me King,
3 330 Why Chance may Crowne me,
3 331 Without my stirre
3 332 
3 333    Banq. New Honors come vpon him
3 334 Like our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,
3 335 But with the aid of vse
3 336 
3 337    Macb. Come what come may,
3 338 Time, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day
3 339 
3 340    Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure
3 341 
3 342    Macb. Giue me your fauour:
3 343 My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.
3 344 Kinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,
3 345 Where euery day I turne the Leafe,
3 346 To reade them.
3 347 Let vs toward the King: thinke vpon
3 348 What hath chanc'd: and at more time,
3 349 The Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake
3 350 Our free Hearts each to other
3 351 
3 352    Banq. Very gladly
3 353 
3 354    Macb. Till then enough:
3 355 Come friends.
3 356 
3 357 Exeunt.
3 358 
3 359 
3 360 Scena Quarta.
3 361 
3 362 Flourish. Enter King, Lenox, Malcolme, Donalbaine, and
3 363 Attendants.
3 364 
3 365   King. Is execution done on Cawdor?
3 366 Or not those in Commission yet return'd?
3 367   Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.
3 368 But I haue spoke with one that saw him die:
3 369 Who did report, that very frankly hee
3 370 Confess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,
3 371 And set forth a deepe Repentance:
3 372 Nothing in his Life became him,
3 373 Like the leauing it. Hee dy'de,
3 374 As one that had beene studied in his death,
3 375 To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,
3 376 As 'twere a carelesse Trifle
3 377 
3 378    King. There's no Art,
3 379 To finde the Mindes construction in the Face.
3 380 He was a Gentleman, on whom I built
3 381 An absolute Trust.
3 382 Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.
3 383 
3 384 O worthyest Cousin,
3 385 The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now
3 386 Was heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,
3 387 That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,
3 388 To ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,
3 389 That the proportion both of thanks, and payment,
3 390 Might haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,
3 391 More is thy due, then more then all can pay
3 392 
3 393    Macb. The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,
3 394 In doing it, payes it selfe.
3 395 Your Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:
3 396 And our Duties are to your Throne, and State,
3 397 Children, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,
3 398 By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue
3 399 And Honor
3 400 
3 401    King. Welcome hither:
3 402 I haue begun to plant thee, and will labour
3 403 To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
3 404 That hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowne
3 405 No lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,
3 406 And hold thee to my Heart
3 407 
3 408    Banq. There if I grow,
3 409 The Haruest is your owne
3 410 
3 411    King. My plenteous Ioyes,
3 412 Wanton in fulnesse, seeke to hide themselues
3 413 In drops of sorrow. Sonnes, Kinsmen, Thanes,
3 414 And you whose places are the nearest, know,
3 415 We will establish our Estate vpon
3 416 Our eldest, Malcolme, whom we name hereafter,
3 417 The Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must
3 418 Not vnaccompanied, inuest him onely,
3 419 But signes of Noblenesse, like Starres, shall shine
3 420 On all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,
3 421 And binde vs further to you
3 422 
3 423    Macb. The Rest is Labor, which is not vs'd for you:
3 424 Ile be my selfe the Herbenger, and make ioyfull
3 425 The hearing of my Wife, with your approach:
3 426 So humbly take my leaue
3 427 
3 428    King. My worthy Cawdor
3 429 
3 430    Macb. The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,
3 431 On which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,
3 432 For in my way it lyes. Starres hide your fires,
3 433 Let not Light see my black and deepe desires:
3 434 The Eye winke at the Hand: yet let that bee,
3 435 Which the Eye feares, when it is done to see.
3 436 Enter.
3 437 
3 438   King. True worthy Banquo: he is full so valiant,
3 439 And in his commendations, I am fed:
3 440 It is a Banquet to me. Let's after him,
3 441 Whose care is gone before, to bid vs welcome:
3 442 It is a peerelesse Kinsman.
3 443 
3 444 Flourish. Exeunt.
3 445 
3 446 
3 447 Scena Quinta.
3 448 
3 449 Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter.
3 450 
3 451   Lady. They met me in the day of successe: and I haue
3 452 learn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then
3 453 mortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them
3 454 further, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.
3 455 Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from
3 456 the King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title
3 457 before, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to
3 458 the comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This
3 459 haue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of
3 460 Greatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing
3 461 by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay
3 462 it to thy heart and farewell.
3 463 Glamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
3 464 What thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,
3 465 It is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,
3 466 To catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,
3 467 Art not without Ambition, but without
3 468 The illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,
3 469 That would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,
3 470 And yet would'st wrongly winne.
3 471 Thould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,
3 472 Thus thou must doe, if thou haue it;
3 473 And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,
3 474 Then wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,
3 475 That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,
3 476 And chastise with the valour of my Tongue
3 477 All that impeides thee from the Golden Round,
3 478 Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme
3 479 To haue thee crown'd withall.
3 480 Enter Messenger.
3 481 
3 482 What is your tidings?
3 483   Mess. The King comes here to Night
3 484 
3 485    Lady. Thou'rt mad to say it.
3 486 Is not thy Master with him? who, wer't so,
3 487 Would haue inform'd for preparation
3 488 
3 489    Mess. So please you, it is true: our Thane is comming:
3 490 One of my fellowes had the speed of him;
3 491 Who almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
3 492 Then would make vp his Message
3 493 
3 494    Lady. Giue him tending,
3 495 He brings great newes,
3 496 
3 497 Exit Messenger.
3 498 
3 499 The Rauen himselfe is hoarse,
3 500 That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan
3 501 Vnder my Battlements. Come you Spirits,
3 502 That tend on mortall thoughts, vnsex me here,
3 503 And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe, top-full
3 504 Of direst Crueltie: make thick my blood,
3 505 Stop vp th' accesse, and passage to Remorse,
3 506 That no compunctious visitings of Nature
3 507 Shake my fell purpose, nor keepe peace betweene
3 508 Th' effect, and hit. Come to my Womans Brests,
3 509 And take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,
3 510 Where-euer, in your sightlesse substances,
3 511 You wait on Natures Mischiefe. Come thick Night,
3 512 And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell,
3 513 
3 514 That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes,
3 515 Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke,
3 516 To cry, hold, hold.
3 517 Enter Macbeth.
3 518 
3 519 Great Glamys, worthy Cawdor,
3 520 Greater then both, by the all-haile hereafter,
3 521 Thy Letters haue transported me beyond
3 522 This ignorant present, and I feele now
3 523 The future in the instant
3 524 
3 525    Macb. My dearest Loue,
3 526 Duncan comes here to Night
3 527 
3 528    Lady. And when goes hence?
3 529   Macb. To morrow, as he purposes
3 530 
3 531    Lady. O neuer,
3 532 Shall Sunne that Morrow see.
3 533 Your Face, my Thane, is as a Booke, where men
3 534 May reade strange matters, to beguile the time.
3 535 Looke like the time, beare welcome in your Eye,
3 536 Your Hand, your Tongue: looke like th' innocent flower,
3 537 But be the Serpent vnder't. He that's comming,
3 538 Must be prouided for: and you shall put
3 539 This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch,
3 540 Which shall to all our Nights, and Dayes to come,
3 541 Giue solely soueraigne sway, and Masterdome
3 542 
3 543    Macb. We will speake further,
3 544   Lady. Onely looke vp cleare:
3 545 To alter fauor, euer is to feare:
3 546 Leaue all the rest to me.
3 547 
3 548 Exeunt.
3 549 
3 550 
3 551 Scena Sexta.
3 552 
3 553 Hoboyes, and Torches. Enter King, Malcolme, Donalbaine,
3 554 Banquo, Lenox,
3 555 Macduff, Rosse, Angus, and Attendants.
3 556 
3 557   King. This Castle hath a pleasant seat,
3 558 The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe
3 559 Vnto our gentle sences
3 560 
3 561    Banq. This Guest of Summer,
3 562 The Temple-haunting Barlet does approue,
3 563 By his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath
3 564 Smells wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,
3 565 Buttrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this Bird
3 566 Hath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,
3 567 Where they must breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd
3 568 The ayre is delicate.
3 569 Enter Lady.
3 570 
3 571   King. See, see our honor'd Hostesse:
3 572 The Loue that followes vs, sometime is our trouble,
3 573 Which still we thanke as Loue. Herein I teach you,
3 574 How you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines,
3 575 And thanke vs for your trouble
3 576 
3 577    Lady. All our seruice,
3 578 In euery point twice done, and then done double,
3 579 Were poore, and single Businesse, to contend
3 580 Against those Honors deepe, and broad,
3 581 Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House:
3 582 For those of old, and the late Dignities,
3 583 Heap'd vp to them, we rest your Ermites
3 584 
3 585    King. Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
3 586 We courst him at the heeles, and had a purpose
3 587 To be his Purueyor: But he rides well,
3 588 And his great Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him
3 589 To his home before vs: Faire and Noble Hostesse
3 590 We are your guest to night
3 591 
3 592    La. Your Seruants euer,
3 593 Haue theirs, themselues, and what is theirs in compt,
3 594 To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure,
3 595 Still to returne your owne
3 596 
3 597    King. Giue me your hand:
3 598 Conduct me to mine Host we loue him highly,
3 599 And shall continue, our Graces towards him.
3 600 By your leaue Hostesse.
3 601 
3 602 Exeunt.
3 603 
3 604 Scena Septima.
3 605 
3 606 Hoboyes. Torches. Enter a Sewer, and diuers Seruants with Dishes
3 607 and
3 608 Seruice ouer the Stage. Then enter Macbeth
3 609 
3 610    Macb. If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,
3 611 It were done quickly: If th' Assassination
3 612 Could trammell vp the Consequence, and catch
3 613 With his surcease, Successe: that but this blow
3 614 Might be the be all, and the end all. Heere,
3 615 But heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,
3 616 Wee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,
3 617 We still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach
3 618 Bloody Instructions, which being taught, returne
3 619 To plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice
3 620 Commends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice
3 621 To our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;
3 622 First, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,
3 623 Strong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,
3 624 Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore,
3 625 Not beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane
3 626 Hath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin
3 627 So cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues
3 628 Will pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against
3 629 The deepe damnation of his taking off:
3 630 And Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,
3 631 Striding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd
3 632 Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,
3 633 Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,
3 634 That teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre
3 635 To pricke the sides of my intent, but onely
3 636 Vaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,
3 637 And falles on th' other.
3 638 Enter Lady.
3 639 
3 640 How now? What Newes?
3 641   La. He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?
3 642   Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?
3 643   La. Know you not, he ha's?
3 644   Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:
3 645 He hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought
3 646 Golden Opinions from all sorts of people,
3 647 Which would be worne now in their newest glosse,
3 648 Not cast aside so soone
3 649 
3 650    La. Was the hope drunke,
3 651 Wherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?
3 652 And wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,
3 653 At what it did so freely? From this time,
3 654 Such I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd
3 655 To be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,
3 656 As thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that
3 657 Which thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,
3 658 And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?
3 659 Letting I dare not, wait vpon I would,
3 660 Like the poore Cat i'th' Addage
3 661 
3 662    Macb. Prythee peace:
3 663 I dare do all that may become a man,
3 664 Who dares do more, is none
3 665 
3 666    La. What Beast was't then
3 667 That made you breake this enterprize to me?
3 668 When you durst do it, then you were a man:
3 669 And to be more then what you were, you would
3 670 Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place
3 671 Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
3 672 They haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now
3 673 Do's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know
3 674 How tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,
3 675 I would, while it was smyling in my Face,
3 676 Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,
3 677 And dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne
3 678 As you haue done to this
3 679 
3 680    Macb. If we should faile?
3 681   Lady. We faile?
3 682 But screw your courage to the sticking place,
3 683 And wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,
3 684 (Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney
3 685 Soundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines
3 686 Will I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,
3 687 That Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,
3 688 Shall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason
3 689 A Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,
3 690 Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,
3 691 What cannot you and I performe vpon
3 692 Th' vnguarded Duncan? What not put vpon
3 693 His spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt
3 694 Of our great quell
3 695 
3 696    Macb. Bring forth Men-Children onely:
3 697 For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose
3 698 Nothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,
3 699 When we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two
3 700 Of his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,
3 701 That they haue don't?
3 702   Lady. Who dares receiue it other,
3 703 As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,
3 704 Vpon his Death?
3 705   Macb. I am settled, and bend vp
3 706 Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.
3 707 Away, and mock the time with fairest show,
3 708 False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know.
3 709 
3 710 Exeunt.
3 711 
3 712 
3 713 Actus Secundus. Scena Prima.
3 714 
3 715 Enter Banquo, and Fleance, with a Torch before him.
3 716 
3 717   Banq. How goes the Night, Boy?
3 718   Fleance. The Moone is downe: I haue not heard the
3 719 Clock
3 720 
3 721    Banq. And she goes downe at Twelue
3 722 
3 723    Fleance. I take't, 'tis later, Sir
3 724 
3 725    Banq. Hold, take my Sword:
3 726 There's Husbandry in Heauen,
3 727 Their Candles are all out: take thee that too.
3 728 A heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me,
3 729 And yet I would not sleepe:
3 730 Mercifull Powers, restraine in me the cursed thoughts
3 731 That Nature giues way to in repose.
3 732 Enter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch.
3 733 
3 734 Giue me my Sword: who's there?
3 735   Macb. A Friend
3 736 
3 737    Banq. What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's a bed.
3 738 He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,
3 739 And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.
3 740 This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,
3 741 By the name of most kind Hostesse,
3 742 And shut vp in measurelesse content
3 743 
3 744    Mac. Being vnprepar'd,
3 745 Our will became the seruant to defect,
3 746 Which else should free haue wrought
3 747 
3 748    Banq. All's well.
3 749 I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:
3 750 To you they haue shew'd some truth
3 751 
3 752    Macb. I thinke not of them:
3 753 Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue,
3 754 We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,
3 755 If you would graunt the time
3 756 
3 757    Banq. At your kind'st leysure
3 758 
3 759    Macb. If you shall cleaue to my consent,
3 760 When 'tis, it shall make Honor for you
3 761 
3 762    Banq. So I lose none,
3 763 In seeking to augment it, but still keepe
3 764 My Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance cleare,
3 765 I shall be counsail'd
3 766 
3 767    Macb. Good repose the while
3 768 
3 769    Banq. Thankes Sir: the like to you.
3 770 
3 771 Exit Banquo.
3 772 
3 773   Macb. Goe bid thy Mistresse, when my drinke is ready,
3 774 She strike vpon the Bell. Get thee to bed.
3 775 Enter.
3 776 
3 777 Is this a Dagger, which I see before me,
3 778 The Handle toward my Hand? Come, let me clutch thee:
3 779 I haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.
3 780 Art thou not fatall Vision, sensible
3 781 To feeling, as to sight? or art thou but
3 782 A Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,
3 783 Proceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?
3 784 I see thee yet, in forme as palpable,
3 785 As this which now I draw.
3 786 Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going,
3 787 And such an Instrument I was to vse.
3 788 Mine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,
3 789 Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
3 790 And on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,
3 791 Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
3 792 It is the bloody Businesse, which informes
3 793 Thus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World
3 794 Nature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse
3 795 The Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates
3 796 Pale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,
3 797 Alarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,
3 798 Whose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
3 799 With Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe
3 800 Moues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth
3 801 Heare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare
3 802 Thy very stones prate of my where-about,
3 803 And take the present horror from the time,
3 804 Which now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:
3 805 Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.
3 806 
3 807 A Bell rings.
3 808 
3 809 I goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.
3 810 Heare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,
3 811 That summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.
3 812 Enter.
3 813 
3 814 
3 815 Scena Secunda.
3 816 
3 817 Enter Lady.
3 818 
3 819   La. That which hath made the[m] drunk, hath made me bold:
3 820 What hath quench'd them, hath giuen me fire.
3 821 Hearke, peace: it was the Owle that shriek'd,
3 822 The fatall Bell-man, which giues the stern'st good-night.
3 823 He is about it, the Doores are open:
3 824 And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge
3 825 With Snores. I haue drugg'd their Possets,
3 826 That Death and Nature doe contend about them,
3 827 Whether they liue, or dye.
3 828 Enter Macbeth.
3 829 
3 830   Macb. Who's there? what hoa?
3 831   Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,
3 832 And 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,
3 833 Confounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,
3 834 He could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled
3 835 My Father as he slept, I had don't.
3 836 My Husband?
3 837   Macb. I haue done the deed:
3 838 Didst thou not heare a noyse?
3 839   Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets cry.
3 840 Did not you speake?
3 841   Macb. When?
3 842   Lady. Now
3 843 
3 844    Macb. As I descended?
3 845   Lady. I
3 846 
3 847    Macb. Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?
3 848   Lady. Donalbaine
3 849 
3 850    Mac. This is a sorry sight
3 851 
3 852    Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight
3 853 
3 854    Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,
3 855 And one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:
3 856 I stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,
3 857 And addrest them againe to sleepe
3 858 
3 859    Lady. There are two lodg'd together
3 860 
3 861    Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,
3 862 As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:
3 863 Listning their feare, I could not say Amen,
3 864 When they did say God blesse vs
3 865 
3 866    Lady. Consider it not so deepely
3 867 
3 868    Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?
3 869 I had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat
3 870 
3 871    Lady. These deeds must not be thought
3 872 After these wayes: so, it will make vs mad
3 873 
3 874    Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:
3 875 Macbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,
3 876 Sleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,
3 877 The death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,
3 878 Balme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,
3 879 Chiefe nourisher in Life's Feast
3 880 
3 881    Lady. What doe you meane?
3 882   Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:
3 883 Glamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor
3 884 Shall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more
3 885 
3 886    Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,
3 887 You doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke
3 888 So braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,
3 889 And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.
3 890 Why did you bring these Daggers from the place?
3 891 They must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare
3 892 The sleepie Groomes with blood
3 893 
3 894    Macb. Ile goe no more:
3 895 I am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:
3 896 Looke on't againe, I dare not
3 897 
3 898    Lady. Infirme of purpose:
3 899 Giue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,
3 900 Are but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,
3 901 That feares a painted Deuill. If he doe bleed,
3 902 Ile guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,
3 903 For it must seeme their Guilt.
3 904 Enter.
3 905 
3 906 Knocke within.
3 907 
3 908   Macb. Whence is that knocking?
3 909 How is't with me, when euery noyse appalls me?
3 910 What Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.
3 911 Will all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood
3 912 Cleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather
3 913 The multitudinous Seas incarnardine,
3 914 Making the Greene one, Red.
3 915 Enter Lady.
3 916 
3 917   Lady. My Hands are of your colour: but I shame
3 918 To weare a Heart so white.
3 919 
3 920 Knocke.
3 921 
3 922 I heare a knocking at the South entry:
3 923 Retyre we to our Chamber:
3 924 A little Water cleares vs of this deed.
3 925 How easie is it then? your Constancie
3 926 Hath left you vnattended.
3 927 
3 928 Knocke.
3 929 
3 930 Hearke, more knocking.
3 931 Get on your Night-Gowne, least occasion call vs,
3 932 And shew vs to be Watchers: be not lost
3 933 So poorely in your thoughts
3 934 
3 935    Macb. To know my deed,
3 936 
3 937 Knocke.
3 938 
3 939 'Twere best not know my selfe.
3 940 Wake Duncan with thy knocking:
3 941 I would thou could'st.
3 942 
3 943 Exeunt.
3 944 
3 945 
3 946 Scena Tertia.
3 947 
3 948 Enter a Porter. Knocking within.
3 949 
3 950   Porter. Here's a knocking indeede: if a man were
3 951 Porter of Hell Gate, hee should haue old turning the
3 952 Key.
3 953 
3 954 Knock.
3 955 
3 956 Knock, Knock, Knock. Who's there
3 957 i'th' name of Belzebub? Here's a Farmer, that hang'd
3 958 himselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue
3 959 Napkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't.
3 960 
3 961 Knock.
3 962 
3 963 Knock, knock. Who's there in th' other Deuils Name?
3 964 Faith here's an Equiuocator, that could sweare in both
3 965 the Scales against eyther Scale, who committed Treason
3 966 enough for Gods sake, yet could not equiuocate to Heauen:
3 967 oh come in, Equiuocator.
3 968 
3 969 Knock.
3 970 
3 971 Knock, Knock, Knock. Who's there? 'Faith here's an English
3 972 Taylor come hither, for stealing out of a French Hose:
3 973 Come in Taylor, here you may rost your Goose.
3 974 Knock.
3 975 
3 976 Knock, Knock. Neuer at quiet: What are you? but this
3 977 place is too cold for Hell. Ile Deuill-Porter it no further:
3 978 I had thought to haue let in some of all Professions, that
3 979 goe the Primrose way to th' euerlasting Bonfire.
3 980 
3 981 Knock.
3 982 
3 983 Anon, anon, I pray you remember the Porter.
3 984 Enter Macduff, and Lenox.
3 985 
3 986   Macd. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to Bed,
3 987 That you doe lye so late?
3 988   Port. Faith Sir, we were carowsing till the second Cock:
3 989 And Drinke, Sir, is a great prouoker of three things
3 990 
3 991    Macd. What three things does Drinke especially
3 992 prouoke?
3 993   Port. Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.
3 994 Lecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes
3 995 the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore
3 996 much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:
3 997 it makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,
3 998 and it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens
3 999 him; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,
3 1000 equiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,
3 1001 leaues him
3 1002 
3 1003    Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night
3 1004 
3 1005    Port. That it did, Sir, i'the very Throat on me: but I
3 1006 requited him for his Lye, and (I thinke) being too strong
3 1007 for him, though he tooke vp my Legges sometime, yet I
3 1008 made a Shift to cast him.
3 1009 Enter Macbeth.
3 1010 
3 1011   Macd. Is thy Master stirring?
3 1012 Our knocking ha's awak'd him: here he comes
3 1013 
3 1014    Lenox. Good morrow, Noble Sir
3 1015 
3 1016    Macb. Good morrow both
3 1017 
3 1018    Macd. Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
3 1019   Macb. Not yet
3 1020 
3 1021    Macd. He did command me to call timely on him,
3 1022 I haue almost slipt the houre
3 1023 
3 1024    Macb. Ile bring you to him
3 1025 
3 1026    Macd. I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you:
3 1027 But yet 'tis one
3 1028 
3 1029    Macb. The labour we delight in, Physicks paine:
3 1030 This is the Doore
3 1031 
3 1032    Macd. Ile make so bold to call, for 'tis my limitted
3 1033 seruice.
3 1034 
3 1035 Exit Macduffe.
3 1036 
3 1037   Lenox. Goes the King hence to day?
3 1038   Macb. He does: he did appoint so
3 1039 
3 1040    Lenox. The Night ha's been vnruly:
3 1041 Where we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,
3 1042 And (as they say) lamentings heard i'th' Ayre;
3 1043 Strange Schreemes of Death,
3 1044 And Prophecying, with Accents terrible,
3 1045 Of dyre Combustion, and confus'd Euents,
3 1046 New hatch'd toth' wofull time.
3 1047 The obscure Bird clamor'd the liue-long Night.
3 1048 Some say, the Earth was Feuorous,
3 1049 And did shake
3 1050 
3 1051    Macb. 'Twas a rough Night
3 1052 
3 1053    Lenox. My young remembrance cannot paralell
3 1054 A fellow to it.
3 1055 Enter Macduff.
3 1056 
3 1057   Macd. O horror, horror, horror,
3 1058 Tongue nor Heart cannot conceiue, nor name thee
3 1059 
3 1060    Macb. and Lenox. What's the matter?
3 1061   Macd. Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:
3 1062 Most sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope
3 1063 The Lords anoynted Temple, and stole thence
3 1064 The Life o'th' Building
3 1065 
3 1066    Macb. What is't you say, the Life?
3 1067   Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?
3 1068   Macd. Approch the Chamber, and destroy your sight
3 1069 With a new Gorgon. Doe not bid me speake:
3 1070 See, and then speake your selues: awake, awake,
3 1071 
3 1072 Exeunt. Macbeth and Lenox.
3 1073 
3 1074 Ring the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,
3 1075 Banquo, and Donalbaine: Malcolme awake,
3 1076 Shake off this Downey sleepe, Deaths counterfeit,
3 1077 And looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see
3 1078 The great Doomes Image: Malcolme, Banquo,
3 1079 As from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,
3 1080 To countenance this horror. Ring the Bell.
3 1081 
3 1082 Bell rings. Enter Lady.
3 1083 
3 1084   Lady. What's the Businesse?
3 1085 That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley
3 1086 The sleepers of the House? speake, speake
3 1087 
3 1088    Macd. O gentle Lady,
3 1089 'Tis not for you to heare what I can speake:
3 1090 The repetition in a Womans eare,
3 1091 Would murther as it fell.
3 1092 Enter Banquo.
3 1093 
3 1094 O Banquo, Banquo, Our Royall Master's murther'd
3 1095 
3 1096    Lady. Woe, alas:
3 1097 What, in our House?
3 1098   Ban. Too cruell, any where.
3 1099 Deare Duff, I prythee contradict thy selfe,
3 1100 And say, it is not so.
3 1101 Enter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse.
3 1102 
3 1103   Macb. Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,
3 1104 I had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,
3 1105 There's nothing serious in Mortalitie:
3 1106 All is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,
3 1107 The Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees
3 1108 Is left this Vault, to brag of.
3 1109 Enter Malcolme and Donalbaine.
3 1110 
3 1111   Donal. What is amisse?
3 1112   Macb. You are, and doe not know't:
3 1113 The Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood
3 1114 Is stopt, the very Source of it is stopt
3 1115 
3 1116    Macd. Your Royall Father's murther'd
3 1117 
3 1118    Mal. Oh, by whom?
3 1119   Lenox. Those of his Chamber, as it seem'd, had don't:
3 1120 Their Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,
3 1121 So were their Daggers, which vnwip'd, we found
3 1122 Vpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,
3 1123 No mans Life was to be trusted with them
3 1124 
3 1125    Macb. O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,
3 1126 That I did kill them
3 1127 
3 1128    Macd. Wherefore did you so?
3 1129   Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,
3 1130 Loyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:
3 1131 Th' expedition of my violent Loue
3 1132 Out-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,
3 1133 His Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,
3 1134 And his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,
3 1135 For Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,
3 1136 Steep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers
3 1137 Vnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,
3 1138 That had a heart to loue; and in that heart,
3 1139 Courage, to make's loue knowne?
3 1140   Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa
3 1141 
3 1142    Macd. Looke to the Lady
3 1143 
3 1144    Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,
3 1145 That most may clayme this argument for ours?
3 1146   Donal. What should be spoken here,
3 1147 Where our Fate hid in an augure hole,
3 1148 May rush, and seize vs? Let's away,
3 1149 Our Teares are not yet brew'd
3 1150 
3 1151    Mal. Nor our strong Sorrow
3 1152 Vpon the foot of Motion
3 1153 
3 1154    Banq. Looke to the Lady:
3 1155 And when we haue our naked Frailties hid,
3 1156 That suffer in exposure; let vs meet,
3 1157 And question this most bloody piece of worke,
3 1158 To know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs:
3 1159 In the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,
3 1160 Against the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight
3 1161 Of Treasonous Mallice
3 1162 
3 1163    Macd. And so doe I
3 1164 
3 1165    All. So all
3 1166 
3 1167    Macb. Let's briefely put on manly readinesse,
3 1168 And meet i'th' Hall together
3 1169 
3 1170    All. Well contented.
3 1171 
3 1172 Exeunt.
3 1173 
3 1174   Malc. What will you doe?
3 1175 Let's not consort with them:
3 1176 To shew an vnfelt Sorrow, is an Office
3 1177 Which the false man do's easie.
3 1178 Ile to England
3 1179 
3 1180    Don. To Ireland, I:
3 1181 Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer:
3 1182 Where we are, there's Daggers in mens smiles;
3 1183 The neere in blood, the neerer bloody
3 1184 
3 1185    Malc. This murtherous Shaft that's shot,
3 1186 Hath not yet lighted: and our safest way,
3 1187 Is to auoid the ayme. Therefore to Horse,
3 1188 And let vs not be daintie of leaue-taking,
3 1189 But shift away: there's warrant in that Theft,
3 1190 Which steales it selfe, when there's no mercie left.
3 1191 
3 1192 Exeunt.
3 1193 
3 1194 
3 1195 
3 1196 Scena Quarta.
3 1197 
3 1198 Enter Rosse, with an Old man.
3 1199 
3 1200   Old man. Threescore and ten I can remember well,
3 1201 Within the Volume of which Time, I haue seene
3 1202 Houres dreadfull, and things strange: but this sore Night
3 1203 Hath trifled former knowings
3 1204 
3 1205    Rosse. Ha, good Father,
3 1206 Thou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,
3 1207 Threatens his bloody Stage: byth' Clock 'tis Day,
3 1208 And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:
3 1209 Is't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,
3 1210 That Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,
3 1211 When liuing Light should kisse it?
3 1212   Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,
3 1213 Euen like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,
3 1214 A Faulcon towring in her pride of place,
3 1215 Was by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd
3 1216 
3 1217    Rosse. And Duncans Horses,
3 1218 (A thing most strange, and certaine)
3 1219 Beauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,
3 1220 Turn'd wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,
3 1221 Contending 'gainst Obedience, as they would
3 1222 Make Warre with Mankinde
3 1223 
3 1224    Old man. 'Tis said, they eate each other
3 1225 
3 1226    Rosse. They did so:
3 1227 To th' amazement of mine eyes that look'd vpon't.
3 1228 Enter Macduffe.
3 1229 
3 1230 Heere comes the good Macduffe.
3 1231 How goes the world Sir, now?
3 1232   Macd. Why see you not?
3 1233   Ross. Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?
3 1234   Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine
3 1235 
3 1236    Ross. Alas the day,
3 1237 What good could they pretend?
3 1238   Macd. They were subborned,
3 1239 Malcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes
3 1240 Are stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them
3 1241 Suspition of the deed
3 1242 
3 1243    Rosse. 'Gainst Nature still,
3 1244 Thriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp
3 1245 Thine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,
3 1246 The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth
3 1247 
3 1248    Macd. He is already nam'd, and gone to Scone
3 1249 To be inuested
3 1250 
3 1251    Rosse. Where is Duncans body?
3 1252   Macd. Carried to Colmekill,
3 1253 The Sacred Store-house of his Predecessors,
3 1254 And Guardian of their Bones
3 1255 
3 1256    Rosse. Will you to Scone?
3 1257   Macd. No Cosin, Ile to Fife
3 1258 
3 1259    Rosse. Well, I will thither
3 1260 
3 1261    Macd. Well may you see things wel done there: Adieu
3 1262 Least our old Robes sit easier then our new
3 1263 
3 1264    Rosse. Farewell, Father
3 1265 
3 1266    Old M. Gods benyson go with you, and with those
3 1267 That would make good of bad, and Friends of Foes.
3 1268 
3 1269 Exeunt. omnes
3 1270 
3 1271 Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.
3 1272 
3 1273 Enter Banquo.
3 1274 
3 1275   Banq. Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
3 1276 As the weyard Women promis'd, and I feare
3 1277 Thou playd'st most fowly for't: yet it was saide
3 1278 It should not stand in thy Posterity,
3 1279 But that my selfe should be the Roote, and Father
3 1280 Of many Kings. If there come truth from them,
3 1281 As vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,
3 1282 Why by the verities on thee made good,
3 1283 May they not be my Oracles as well,
3 1284 And set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.
3 1285 
3 1286 Senit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords,
3 1287 and
3 1288 Attendants.
3 1289 
3 1290   Macb. Heere's our chiefe Guest
3 1291 
3 1292    La. If he had beene forgotten,
3 1293 It had bene as a gap in our great Feast,
3 1294 And all-thing vnbecomming
3 1295 
3 1296    Macb. To night we hold a solemne Supper sir,
3 1297 And Ile request your presence
3 1298 
3 1299    Banq. Let your Highnesse
3 1300 Command vpon me, to the which my duties
3 1301 Are with a most indissoluble tye
3 1302 For euer knit
3 1303 
3 1304    Macb. Ride you this afternoone?
3 1305   Ban. I, my good Lord
3 1306 
3 1307    Macb. We should haue else desir'd your good aduice
3 1308 (Which still hath been both graue, and prosperous)
3 1309 In this dayes Councell: but wee'le take to morrow.
3 1310 Is't farre you ride?
3 1311   Ban. As farre, my Lord, as will fill vp the time
3 1312 'Twixt this, and Supper. Goe not my Horse the better,
3 1313 I must become a borrower of the Night,
3 1314 For a darke houre, or twaine
3 1315 
3 1316    Macb. Faile not our Feast
3 1317 
3 1318    Ban. My Lord, I will not
3 1319 
3 1320    Macb. We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow'd
3 1321 In England, and in Ireland, not confessing
3 1322 Their cruell Parricide, filling their hearers
3 1323 With strange inuention. But of that to morrow,
3 1324 When therewithall, we shall haue cause of State,
3 1325 Crauing vs ioyntly. Hye you to Horse:
3 1326 Adieu, till you returne at Night.
3 1327 Goes Fleance with you?
3 1328   Ban. I, my good Lord: our time does call vpon's
3 1329 
3 1330    Macb. I wish your Horses swift, and sure of foot:
3 1331 And so I doe commend you to their backs.
3 1332 Farwell.
3 1333 
3 1334 Exit Banquo.
3 1335 
3 1336 Let euery man be master of his time,
3 1337 Till seuen at Night, to make societie
3 1338 The sweeter welcome:
3 1339 We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone:
3 1340 While then, God be with you.
3 1341 
3 1342 Exeunt. Lords.
3 1343 
3 1344 Sirrha, a word with you: Attend those men
3 1345 Our pleasure?
3 1346   Seruant. They are, my Lord, without the Pallace
3 1347 Gate
3 1348 
3 1349    Macb. Bring them before vs.
3 1350 
3 1351 Exit Seruant.
3 1352 
3 1353 To be thus, is nothing, but to be safely thus
3 1354 Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe,
3 1355 And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that
3 1356 Which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
3 1357 And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,
3 1358 He hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,
3 1359 To act in safetie. There is none but he,
3 1360 Whose being I doe feare: and vnder him,
3 1361 My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said
3 1362 Mark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,
3 1363 When first they put the Name of King vpon me,
3 1364 And bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,
3 1365 They hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.
3 1366 Vpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,
3 1367 And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,
3 1368 Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,
3 1369 No Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,
3 1370 For Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,
3 1371 For them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,
3 1372 Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace
3 1373 Onely for them, and mine eternall Iewell
3 1374 Giuen to the common Enemie of Man,
3 1375 To make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.
3 1376 Rather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,
3 1377 And champion me to th' vtterance.
3 1378 Who's there?
3 1379 Enter Seruant, and two Murtherers.
3 1380 
3 1381 Now goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.
3 1382 
3 1383 Exit Seruant.
3 1384 
3 1385 Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
3 1386   Murth. It was, so please your Highnesse
3 1387 
3 1388    Macb. Well then,
3 1389 Now haue you consider'd of my speeches:
3 1390 Know, that it was he, in the times past,
3 1391 Which held you so vnder fortune,
3 1392 Which you thought had been our innocent selfe.
3 1393 This I made good to you, in our last conference,
3 1394 Past in probation with you:
3 1395 How you were borne in hand, how crost:
3 1396 The Instruments: who wrought with them:
3 1397 And all things else, that might
3 1398 To halfe a Soule, and to a Notion craz'd,
3 1399 Say, Thus did Banquo
3 1400 
3 1401    1.Murth. You made it knowne to vs
3 1402 
3 1403    Macb. I did so:
3 1404 And went further, which is now
3 1405 Our point of second meeting.
3 1406 Doe you finde your patience so predominant,
3 1407 In your nature, that you can let this goe?
3 1408 Are you so Gospell'd, to pray for this good man,
3 1409 And for his Issue, whose heauie hand
3 1410 Hath bow'd you to the Graue, and begger'd
3 1411 Yours for euer?
3 1412   1.Murth. We are men, my Liege
3 1413 
3 1414    Macb. I, in the Catalogue ye goe for men,
3 1415 As Hounds, and Greyhounds, Mungrels, Spaniels, Curres,
3 1416 Showghes, Water-Rugs, and Demy-Wolues are clipt
3 1417 All by the Name of Dogges: the valued file
3 1418 Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
3 1419 The House-keeper, the Hunter, euery one
3 1420 According to the gift, which bounteous Nature
3 1421 Hath in him clos'd: whereby he does receiue
3 1422 Particular addition, from the Bill,
3 1423 That writes them all alike: and so of men.
3 1424 Now, if you haue a station in the file,
3 1425 Not i'th' worst ranke of Manhood, say't,
3 1426 And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes,
3 1427 Whose execution takes your Enemie off,
3 1428 Grapples you to the heart; and loue of vs,
3 1429 Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life,
3 1430 Which in his Death were perfect
3 1431 
3 1432    2.Murth. I am one, my Liege,
3 1433 Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World
3 1434 Hath so incens'd, that I am recklesse what I doe,
3 1435 To spight the World
3 1436 
3 1437    1.Murth. And I another,
3 1438 So wearie with Disasters, tugg'd with Fortune,
3 1439 That I would set my Life on any Chance,
3 1440 To mend it, or be rid on't
3 1441 
3 1442    Macb. Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie
3 1443 
3 1444    Murth. True, my Lord
3 1445 
3 1446    Macb. So is he mine: and in such bloody distance,
3 1447 That euery minute of his being, thrusts
3 1448 Against my neer'st of Life: and though I could
3 1449 With bare-fac'd power sweepe him from my sight,
3 1450 And bid my will auouch it; yet I must not,
3 1451 For certaine friends that are both his, and mine,
3 1452 Whose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,
3 1453 Who I my selfe struck downe: and thence it is,
3 1454 That I to your assistance doe make loue,
3 1455 Masking the Businesse from the common Eye,
3 1456 For sundry weightie Reasons
3 1457 
3 1458    2.Murth. We shall, my Lord,
3 1459 Performe what you command vs
3 1460 
3 1461    1.Murth. Though our Liues-
3 1462   Macb. Your Spirits shine through you.
3 1463 Within this houre, at most,
3 1464 I will aduise you where to plant your selues,
3 1465 Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o'th' time,
3 1466 The moment on't, for't must be done to Night,
3 1467 And something from the Pallace: alwayes thought,
3 1468 That I require a clearenesse; and with him,
3 1469 To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke:
3 1470   Fleans , his Sonne, that keepes him companie,
3 1471 Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me,
3 1472 Then is his Fathers, must embrace the fate
3 1473 Of that darke houre: resolue your selues apart,
3 1474 Ile come to you anon
3 1475 
3 1476    Murth. We are resolu'd, my Lord
3 1477 
3 1478    Macb. Ile call vpon you straight: abide within,
3 1479 It is concluded: Banquo, thy Soules flight,
3 1480 If it finde Heauen, must finde it out to Night.
3 1481 
3 1482 Exeunt.
3 1483 
3 1484 
3 1485 Scena Secunda.
3 1486 
3 1487 Enter Macbeths Lady, and a Seruant.
3 1488 
3 1489   Lady. Is Banquo gone from Court?
3 1490   Seruant. I, Madame, but returnes againe to Night
3 1491 
3 1492    Lady. Say to the King, I would attend his leysure,
3 1493 For a few words
3 1494 
3 1495    Seruant. Madame, I will.
3 1496 Enter.
3 1497 
3 1498   Lady. Nought's had, all's spent.
3 1499 Where our desire is got without content:
3 1500 'Tis safer, to be that which we destroy,
3 1501 Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy.
3 1502 Enter Macbeth.
3 1503 
3 1504 How now, my Lord, why doe you keepe alone?
3 1505 Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making,
3 1506 Vsing those Thoughts, which should indeed haue dy'd
3 1507 With them they thinke on: things without all remedie
3 1508 Should be without regard: what's done, is done
3 1509 
3 1510    Macb. We haue scorch'd the Snake, not kill'd it:
3 1511 Shee'le close, and be her selfe, whilest our poore Mallice
3 1512 Remaines in danger of her former Tooth.
3 1513 But let the frame of things dis-ioynt,
3 1514 Both the Worlds suffer,
3 1515 Ere we will eate our Meale in feare, and sleepe
3 1516 In the affliction of these terrible Dreames,
3 1517 That shake vs Nightly: Better be with the dead,
3 1518 Whom we, to gayne our peace, haue sent to peace,
3 1519 Then on the torture of the Minde to lye
3 1520 In restlesse extasie.
3 1521 Duncane is in his Graue:
3 1522 After Lifes fitfull Feuer, he sleepes well,
3 1523 Treason ha's done his worst: nor Steele, nor Poyson,
3 1524 Mallice domestique, forraine Leuie, nothing,
3 1525 Can touch him further
3 1526 
3 1527    Lady. Come on:
3 1528 Gentle my Lord, sleeke o're your rugged Lookes,
3 1529 Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night
3 1530 
3 1531    Macb. So shall I Loue, and so I pray be you:
3 1532 Let your remembrance apply to Banquo,
3 1533 Present him Eminence, both with Eye and Tongue:
3 1534 Vnsafe the while, that wee must laue
3 1535 Our Honors in these flattering streames,
3 1536 And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts,
3 1537 Disguising what they are
3 1538 
3 1539    Lady. You must leaue this
3 1540 
3 1541    Macb. O, full of Scorpions is my Minde, deare Wife:
3 1542 Thou know'st, that Banquo and his Fleans liues
3 1543 
3 1544    Lady. But in them, Natures Coppie's not eterne
3 1545 
3 1546    Macb. There's comfort yet, they are assaileable,
3 1547 Then be thou iocund: ere the Bat hath flowne
3 1548 His Cloyster'd flight, ere to black Heccats summons
3 1549 The shard-borne Beetle, with his drowsie hums,
3 1550 Hath rung Nights yawning Peale,
3 1551 There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note
3 1552 
3 1553    Lady. What's to be done?
3 1554   Macb. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest Chuck,
3 1555 Till thou applaud the deed: Come, seeling Night,
3 1556 Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day,
3 1557 And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand
3 1558 Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond,
3 1559 Which keepes me pale. Light thickens,
3 1560 And the Crow makes Wing toth' Rookie Wood:
3 1561 Good things of Day begin to droope, and drowse,
3 1562 Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey's doe rowse.
3 1563 Thou maruell'st at my words: but hold thee still,
3 1564 Things bad begun, make strong themselues by ill:
3 1565 So prythee goe with me.
3 1566 
3 1567 Exeunt.
3 1568 
3 1569 
3 1570 Scena Tertia.
3 1571 
3 1572 Enter three Murtherers.
3 1573 
3 1574   1. But who did bid thee ioyne with vs?
3 1575   3. Macbeth
3 1576 
3 1577    2. He needes not our mistrust, since he deliuers
3 1578 Our Offices, and what we haue to doe,
3 1579 To the direction iust
3 1580 
3 1581    1. Then stand with vs:
3 1582 The West yet glimmers with some streakes of Day.
3 1583 Now spurres the lated Traueller apace,
3 1584 To gayne the timely Inne, and neere approches
3 1585 The subiect of our Watch
3 1586 
3 1587    3. Hearke, I heare Horses
3 1588 
3 1589    Banquo within. Giue vs a Light there, hoa
3 1590 
3 1591    2. Then 'tis hee:
3 1592 The rest, that are within the note of expectation,
3 1593 Alreadie are i'th' Court
3 1594 
3 1595    1. His Horses goe about
3 1596 
3 1597    3. Almost a mile: but he does vsually,
3 1598 So all men doe, from hence toth' Pallace Gate
3 1599 Make it their Walke.
3 1600 Enter Banquo and Fleans, with a Torch.
3 1601 
3 1602   2. A Light, a Light
3 1603 
3 1604    3. 'Tis hee
3 1605 
3 1606    1. Stand too't
3 1607 
3 1608    Ban. It will be Rayne to Night
3 1609 
3 1610    1. Let it come downe
3 1611 
3 1612    Ban. O, Trecherie!
3 1613 Flye good Fleans, flye, flye, flye,
3 1614 Thou may'st reuenge. O Slaue!
3 1615   3. Who did strike out the Light?
3 1616   1. Was't not the way?
3 1617   3. There's but one downe: the Sonne is fled
3 1618 
3 1619    2. We haue lost
3 1620 Best halfe of our Affaire
3 1621 
3 1622    1. Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
3 1623 
3 1624 Exeunt.
3 1625 
3 1626 
3 1627 Scaena Quarta.
3 1628 
3 1629 Banquet prepar'd. Enter Macbeth, Lady, Rosse, Lenox, Lords, and
3 1630 Attendants.
3 1631 
3 1632   Macb. You know your owne degrees, sit downe:
3 1633 At first and last, the hearty welcome
3 1634 
3 1635    Lords. Thankes to your Maiesty
3 1636 
3 1637    Macb. Our selfe will mingle with Society,
3 1638 And play the humble Host:
3 1639 Our Hostesse keepes her State, but in best time
3 1640 We will require her welcome
3 1641 
3 1642    La. Pronounce it for me Sir, to all our Friends,
3 1643 For my heart speakes, they are welcome.
3 1644 Enter first Murtherer.
3 1645 
3 1646   Macb. See they encounter thee with their harts thanks
3 1647 Both sides are euen: heere Ile sit i'th' mid'st,
3 1648 Be large in mirth, anon wee'l drinke a Measure
3 1649 The Table round. There's blood vpon thy face
3 1650 
3 1651    Mur. 'Tis Banquo's then
3 1652 
3 1653    Macb. 'Tis better thee without, then he within.
3 1654 Is he dispatch'd?
3 1655   Mur. My Lord his throat is cut, that I did for him
3 1656 
3 1657    Mac. Thou art the best o'th' Cut-throats,
3 1658 Yet hee's good that did the like for Fleans:
3 1659 If thou did'st it, thou art the Non-pareill
3 1660 
3 1661    Mur. Most Royall Sir
3 1662 Fleans is scap'd
3 1663 
3 1664    Macb. Then comes my Fit againe:
3 1665 I had else beene perfect;
3 1666 Whole as the Marble, founded as the Rocke,
3 1667 As broad, and generall, as the casing Ayre:
3 1668 But now I am cabin'd, crib'd, confin'd, bound in
3 1669 To sawcy doubts, and feares. But Banquo's safe?
3 1670   Mur. I, my good Lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
3 1671 With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
3 1672 The least a Death to Nature
3 1673 
3 1674    Macb. Thankes for that:
3 1675 There the growne Serpent lyes, the worme that's fled
3 1676 Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed,
3 1677 No teeth for th' present. Get thee gone, to morrow
3 1678 Wee'l heare our selues againe.
3 1679 
3 1680 Exit Murderer.
3 1681 
3 1682   Lady. My Royall Lord,
3 1683 You do not giue the Cheere, the Feast is sold
3 1684 That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a making:
3 1685 'Tis giuen, with welcome: to feede were best at home:
3 1686 From thence, the sawce to meate is Ceremony,
3 1687 Meeting were bare without it.
3 1688 Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeths place.
3 1689 
3 1690   Macb. Sweet Remembrancer:
3 1691 Now good digestion waite on Appetite,
3 1692 And health on both
3 1693 
3 1694    Lenox. May't please your Highnesse sit
3 1695 
3 1696    Macb. Here had we now our Countries Honor, roof'd,
3 1697 Were the grac'd person of our Banquo present:
3 1698 Who, may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse,
3 1699 Then pitty for Mischance
3 1700 
3 1701    Rosse. His absence (Sir)
3 1702 Layes blame vpon his promise. Pleas't your Highnesse
3 1703 To grace vs with your Royall Company?
3 1704   Macb. The Table's full
3 1705 
3 1706    Lenox. Heere is a place reseru'd Sir
3 1707 
3 1708    Macb. Where?
3 1709   Lenox. Heere my good Lord.
3 1710 What is't that moues your Highnesse?
3 1711   Macb. Which of you haue done this?
3 1712   Lords. What, my good Lord?
3 1713   Macb. Thou canst not say I did it: neuer shake
3 1714 Thy goary lockes at me
3 1715 
3 1716    Rosse. Gentlemen rise, his Highnesse is not well
3 1717 
3 1718    Lady. Sit worthy Friends: my Lord is often thus,
3 1719 And hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,
3 1720 The fit is momentary, vpon a thought
3 1721 He will againe be well. If much you note him
3 1722 You shall offend him, and extend his Passion,
3 1723 Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
3 1724   Macb. I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that
3 1725 Which might appall the Diuell
3 1726 
3 1727    La. O proper stuffe:
3 1728 This is the very painting of your feare:
3 1729 This is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said
3 1730 Led you to Duncan. O, these flawes and starts
3 1731 (Impostors to true feare) would well become
3 1732 A womans story, at a Winters fire
3 1733 Authoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe,
3 1734 Why do you make such faces? When all's done
3 1735 You looke but on a stoole
3 1736 
3 1737    Macb. Prythee see there:
3 1738 Behold, looke, loe, how say you:
3 1739 Why what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.
3 1740 If Charnell houses, and our Graues must send
3 1741 Those that we bury, backe; our Monuments
3 1742 Shall be the Mawes of Kytes
3 1743 
3 1744    La. What? quite vnmann'd in folly
3 1745 
3 1746    Macb. If I stand heere, I saw him
3 1747 
3 1748    La. Fie for shame
3 1749 
3 1750    Macb. Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time
3 1751 Ere humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:
3 1752 I, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd
3 1753 Too terrible for the eare. The times has bene,
3 1754 That when the Braines were out, the man would dye,
3 1755 And there an end: But now they rise againe
3 1756 With twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,
3 1757 And push vs from our stooles. This is more strange
3 1758 Then such a murther is
3 1759 
3 1760    La. My worthy Lord
3 1761 Your Noble Friends do lacke you
3 1762 
3 1763    Macb. I do forget:
3 1764 Do not muse at me my most worthy Friends,
3 1765 I haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing
3 1766 To those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,
3 1767 Then Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:
3 1768 Enter Ghost.
3 1769 
3 1770 I drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,
3 1771 And to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:
3 1772 Would he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,
3 1773 And all to all
3 1774 
3 1775    Lords. Our duties, and the pledge
3 1776 
3 1777    Mac. Auant, & quit my sight, let the earth hide thee:
3 1778 Thy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold:
3 1779 Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
3 1780 Which thou dost glare with
3 1781 
3 1782    La. Thinke of this good Peeres
3 1783 But as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,
3 1784 Onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time
3 1785 
3 1786    Macb. What man dare, I dare:
3 1787 Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,
3 1788 The arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,
3 1789 Take any shape but that, and my firme Nerues
3 1790 Shall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,
3 1791 And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:
3 1792 If trembling I inhabit then, protest mee
3 1793 The Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,
3 1794 Vnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone
3 1795 I am a man againe: pray you sit still
3 1796 
3 1797    La. You haue displac'd the mirth,
3 1798 Broke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder
3 1799 
3 1800    Macb. Can such things be,
3 1801 And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,
3 1802 Without our speciall wonder? You make me strange
3 1803 Euen to the disposition that I owe,
3 1804 When now I thinke you can behold such sights,
3 1805 And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,
3 1806 When mine is blanch'd with feare
3 1807 
3 1808    Rosse. What sights, my Lord?
3 1809   La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse
3 1810 Question enrages him: at once, goodnight.
3 1811 Stand not vpon the order of your going,
3 1812 But go at once
3 1813 
3 1814    Len. Good night, and better health
3 1815 Attend his Maiesty
3 1816 
3 1817    La. A kinde goodnight to all.
3 1818 
3 1819 Exit Lords.
3 1820 
3 1821   Macb. It will haue blood they say:
3 1822 Blood will haue Blood:
3 1823 Stones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake:
3 1824 Augures, and vnderstood Relations, haue
3 1825 By Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth
3 1826 The secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?
3 1827   La. Almost at oddes with morning, which is which
3 1828 
3 1829    Macb. How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person
3 1830 At our great bidding
3 1831 
3 1832    La. Did you send to him Sir?
3 1833   Macb. I heare it by the way: But I will send:
3 1834 There's not a one of them but in his house
3 1835 I keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow
3 1836 (And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.
3 1837 More shall they speake: for now I am bent to know
3 1838 By the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,
3 1839 All causes shall giue way. I am in blood
3 1840 Stept in so farre, that should I wade no more,
3 1841 Returning were as tedious as go ore:
3 1842 Strange things I haue in head, that will to hand,
3 1843 Which must be acted, ere they may be scand
3 1844 
3 1845    La. You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe
3 1846 
3 1847    Macb. Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange & self-abuse
3 1848 Is the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:
3 1849 We are yet but yong indeed.
3 1850 
3 1851 Exeunt.
3 1852 
3 1853 
3 1854 Scena Quinta.
3 1855 
3 1856 Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecat.
3 1857 
3 1858   1. Why how now Hecat, you looke angerly?
3 1859   Hec. Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?
3 1860 Sawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare
3 1861 To Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,
3 1862 In Riddles, and Affaires of death;
3 1863 And I the Mistris of your Charmes,
3 1864 The close contriuer of all harmes,
3 1865 Was neuer call'd to beare my part,
3 1866 Or shew the glory of our Art?
3 1867 And which is worse, all you haue done
3 1868 Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne,
3 1869 Spightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)
3 1870 Loues for his owne ends, not for you.
3 1871 But make amends now: Get you gon,
3 1872 And at the pit of Acheron
3 1873 Meete me i'th' Morning: thither he
3 1874 Will come, to know his Destinie.
3 1875 Your Vessels, and your Spels prouide,
3 1876 Your Charmes, and euery thing beside;
3 1877 I am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend
3 1878 Vnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.
3 1879 Great businesse must be wrought ere Noone.
3 1880 Vpon the Corner of the Moone
3 1881 There hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,
3 1882 Ile catch it ere it come to ground;
3 1883 And that distill'd by Magicke slights,
3 1884 Shall raise such Artificiall Sprights,
3 1885 As by the strength of their illusion,
3 1886 Shall draw him on to his Confusion.
3 1887 He shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare
3 1888 His hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:
3 1889 And you all know, Security
3 1890 Is Mortals cheefest Enemie.
3 1891 
3 1892 Musicke, and a Song.
3 1893 
3 1894 Hearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see
3 1895 Sits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.
3 1896 
3 1897 Sing within. Come away, come away, &c.
3 1898 
3 1899   1 Come, let's make hast, shee'l soone be
3 1900 Backe againe.
3 1901 
3 1902 Exeunt.
3 1903 
3 1904 
3 1905 Scaena Sexta.
3 1906 
3 1907 Enter Lenox, and another Lord.
3 1908 
3 1909   Lenox. My former Speeches,
3 1910 Haue but hit your Thoughts
3 1911 Which can interpret farther: Onely I say
3 1912 Things haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
3 1913 Was pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:
3 1914 And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
3 1915 Whom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,
3 1916 For Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.
3 1917 Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
3 1918 It was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane
3 1919 To kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,
3 1920 How it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight
3 1921 In pious rage, the two delinquents teare,
3 1922 That were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?
3 1923 Was not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:
3 1924 For 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue
3 1925 To heare the men deny't. So that I say,
3 1926 He ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,
3 1927 That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,
3 1928 (As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde
3 1929 What 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.
3 1930 But peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd
3 1931 His presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare
3 1932 Macduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
3 1933 Where he bestowes himselfe?
3 1934   Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane
3 1935 (From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)
3 1936 Liues in the English Court, and is receyu'd
3 1937 Of the most Pious Edward, with such grace,
3 1938 That the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing
3 1939 Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe
3 1940 Is gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd
3 1941 To wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,
3 1942 That by the helpe of these (with him aboue)
3 1943 To ratifie the Worke) we may againe
3 1944 Giue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:
3 1945 Free from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;
3 1946 Do faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,
3 1947 All which we pine for now. And this report
3 1948 Hath so exasperate their King, that hee
3 1949 Prepares for some attempt of Warre
3 1950 
3 1951    Len. Sent he to Macduffe?
3 1952   Lord. He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I
3 1953 The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,
3 1954 And hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time
3 1955 That clogges me with this Answer
3 1956 
3 1957    Lenox. And that well might
3 1958 Aduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance
3 1959 His wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell
3 1960 Flye to the Court of England, and vnfold
3 1961 His Message ere he come, that a swift blessing
3 1962 May soone returne to this our suffering Country,
3 1963 Vnder a hand accurs'd
3 1964 
3 1965    Lord. Ile send my Prayers with him.
3 1966 
3 1967 Exeunt.
3 1968 
3 1969 Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.
3 1970 
3 1971 Thunder. Enter the three Witches.
3 1972 
3 1973   1 Thrice the brinded Cat hath mew'd
3 1974 
3 1975    2 Thrice, and once the Hedge-Pigge whin'd
3 1976 
3 1977    3 Harpier cries, 'tis time, 'tis time
3 1978 
3 1979    1 Round about the Caldron go:
3 1980 In the poysond Entrailes throw
3 1981 Toad, that vnder cold stone,
3 1982 Dayes and Nights, ha's thirty one:
3 1983 Sweltred Venom sleeping got,
3 1984 Boyle thou first i'th' charmed pot
3 1985 
3 1986    All. Double, double, toile and trouble;
3 1987 Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
3 1988 
3 1989    2 Fillet of a Fenny Snake,
3 1990 In the Cauldron boyle and bake:
3 1991 Eye of Newt, and Toe of Frogge,
3 1992 Wooll of Bat, and Tongue of Dogge:
3 1993 Adders Forke, and Blinde-wormes Sting,
3 1994 Lizards legge, and Howlets wing:
3 1995 For a Charme of powrefull trouble,
3 1996 Like a Hell-broth, boyle and bubble
3 1997 
3 1998    All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,
3 1999 Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
3 2000 
3 2001    3 Scale of Dragon, Tooth of Wolfe,
3 2002 Witches Mummey, Maw, and Gulfe
3 2003 Of the rauin'd salt Sea sharke:
3 2004 Roote of Hemlocke, digg'd i'th' darke:
3 2005 Liuer of Blaspheming Iew,
3 2006 Gall of Goate, and Slippes of Yew,
3 2007 Sliuer'd in the Moones Ecclipse:
3 2008 Nose of Turke, and Tartars lips:
3 2009 Finger of Birth-strangled Babe,
3 2010 Ditch-deliuer'd by a Drab,
3 2011 Make the Grewell thicke, and slab.
3 2012 Adde thereto a Tigers Chawdron,
3 2013 For th' Ingredience of our Cawdron
3 2014 
3 2015    All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,
3 2016 Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
3 2017 
3 2018    2 Coole it with a Baboones blood,
3 2019 Then the Charme is firme and good.
3 2020 Enter Hecat, and the other three Witches.
3 2021 
3 2022   Hec. O well done: I commend your paines,
3 2023 And euery one shall share i'th' gaines:
3 2024 And now about the Cauldron sing
3 2025 Like Elues and Fairies in a Ring,
3 2026 Inchanting all that you put in.
3 2027 
3 2028 Musicke and a Song. Blacke Spirits, &c.
3 2029 
3 2030   2 By the pricking of my Thumbes,
3 2031 Something wicked this way comes:
3 2032 Open Lockes, who euer knockes.
3 2033 Enter Macbeth.
3 2034 
3 2035   Macb. How now you secret, black, & midnight Hags?
3 2036 What is't you do?
3 2037   All. A deed without a name
3 2038 
3 2039    Macb. I coniure you, by that which you Professe,
3 2040 (How ere you come to know it) answer me:
3 2041 Though you vntye the Windes, and let them fight
3 2042 Against the Churches: Though the yesty Waues
3 2043 Confound and swallow Nauigation vp:
3 2044 Though bladed Corne be lodg'd, & Trees blown downe,
3 2045 Though Castles topple on their Warders heads:
3 2046 Though Pallaces, and Pyramids do slope
3 2047 Their heads to their Foundations: Though the treasure
3 2048 Of Natures Germaine, tumble altogether,
3 2049 Euen till destruction sicken: Answer me
3 2050 To what I aske you
3 2051 
3 2052    1 Speake
3 2053 
3 2054    2 Demand
3 2055 
3 2056    3 Wee'l answer
3 2057 
3 2058    1 Say, if th'hadst rather heare it from our mouthes,
3 2059 Or from our Masters
3 2060 
3 2061    Macb. Call 'em: let me see 'em
3 2062 
3 2063    1 Powre in Sowes blood, that hath eaten
3 2064 Her nine Farrow: Greaze that's sweaten
3 2065 From the Murderers Gibbet, throw
3 2066 Into the Flame
3 2067 
3 2068    All. Come high or low:
3 2069 Thy Selfe and Office deaftly show.
3 2070 Thunder. 1. Apparation, an Armed Head.
3 2071 
3 2072   Macb. Tell me, thou vnknowne power
3 2073 
3 2074    1 He knowes thy thought:
3 2075 Heare his speech, but say thou nought
3 2076 
3 2077    1 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth:
3 2078 Beware Macduffe,
3 2079 Beware the Thane of Fife: dismisse me. Enough.
3 2080 
3 2081 He Descends.
3 2082 
3 2083   Macb. What ere thou art, for thy good caution, thanks
3 2084 Thou hast harp'd my feare aright. But one word more
3 2085 
3 2086    1 He will not be commanded: heere's another
3 2087 More potent then the first.
3 2088 
3 2089 Thunder. 2 Apparition, a Bloody Childe.
3 2090 
3 2091   2 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth
3 2092 
3 2093    Macb. Had I three eares, Il'd heare thee
3 2094 
3 2095    Appar. Be bloody, bold, & resolute:
3 2096 Laugh to scorne
3 2097 The powre of man: For none of woman borne
3 2098 Shall harme Macbeth.
3 2099 
3 2100 Descends.
3 2101 
3 2102   Mac. Then liue Macduffe: what need I feare of thee?
3 2103 But yet Ile make assurance: double sure,
3 2104 And take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,
3 2105 That I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;
3 2106 And sleepe in spight of Thunder.
3 2107 
3 2108 Thunder 3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.
3 2109 
3 2110 What is this, that rises like the issue of a King,
3 2111 And weares vpon his Baby-brow, the round
3 2112 And top of Soueraignty?
3 2113   All. Listen, but speake not too't
3 2114 
3 2115    3 Appar. Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:
3 2116 Who chafes, who frets, or where Conspirers are:
3 2117 Macbeth shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill
3 2118 Great Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill
3 2119 Shall come against him.
3 2120 
3 2121 Descend.
3 2122 
3 2123   Macb. That will neuer bee:
3 2124 Who can impresse the Forrest, bid the Tree
3 2125 Vnfixe his earth-bound Root? Sweet boadments, good:
3 2126 Rebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood
3 2127 Of Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth
3 2128 Shall liue the Lease of Nature, pay his breath
3 2129 To time, and mortall Custome. Yet my Hart
3 2130 Throbs to know one thing: Tell me, if your Art
3 2131 Can tell so much: Shall Banquo's issue euer
3 2132 Reigne in this Kingdome?
3 2133   All. Seeke to know no more
3 2134 
3 2135    Macb. I will be satisfied. Deny me this,
3 2136 And an eternall Curse fall on you: Let me know.
3 2137 Why sinkes that Caldron? & what noise is this?
3 2138 
3 2139 Hoboyes
3 2140 
3 2141   1 Shew
3 2142 
3 2143    2 Shew
3 2144 
3 2145    3 Shew
3 2146 
3 2147    All. Shew his Eyes, and greeue his Hart,
3 2148 Come like shadowes, so depart.
3 2149 
3 2150 A shew of eight Kings, and Banquo last, with a glasse in his hand.
3 2151 
3 2152   Macb. Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:
3 2153 Thy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire
3 2154 Thou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:
3 2155 A third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,
3 2156 Why do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!
3 2157 What will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?
3 2158 Another yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:
3 2159 And yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,
3 2160 Which shewes me many more: and some I see,
3 2161 That two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.
3 2162 Horrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,
3 2163 For the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles vpon me,
3 2164 And points at them for his. What? is this so?
3 2165   1 I Sir, all this is so. But why
3 2166 Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
3 2167 Come Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,
3 2168 And shew the best of our delights.
3 2169 Ile Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,
3 2170 While you performe your Antique round:
3 2171 That this great King may kindly say,
3 2172 Our duties, did his welcome pay.
3 2173 
3 2174 Musicke. The Witches Dance, and vanish.
3 2175 
3 2176   Macb. Where are they? Gone?
3 2177 Let this pernitious houre,
3 2178 Stand aye accursed in the Kalender.
3 2179 Come in, without there.
3 2180 Enter Lenox.
3 2181 
3 2182   Lenox. What's your Graces will
3 2183 
3 2184    Macb. Saw you the Weyard Sisters?
3 2185   Lenox. No my Lord
3 2186 
3 2187    Macb. Came they not by you?
3 2188   Lenox. No indeed my Lord
3 2189 
3 2190    Macb. Infected be the Ayre whereon they ride,
3 2191 And damn'd all those that trust them. I did heare
3 2192 The gallopping of Horse. Who was't came by?
3 2193   Len. 'Tis two or three my Lord, that bring you word:
3 2194 Macduff is fled to England
3 2195 
3 2196    Macb. Fled to England?
3 2197   Len. I, my good Lord
3 2198 
3 2199    Macb. Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits:
3 2200 The flighty purpose neuer is o're-tooke
3 2201 Vnlesse the deed go with it. From this moment,
3 2202 The very firstlings of my heart shall be
3 2203 The firstlings of my hand. And euen now
3 2204 To Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:
3 2205 The Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.
3 2206 Seize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword
3 2207 His Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules
3 2208 That trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,
3 2209 This deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,
3 2210 But no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?
3 2211 Come bring me where they are.
3 2212 
3 2213 Exeunt.
3 2214 
3 2215 Scena Secunda.
3 2216 
3 2217 Enter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.
3 2218 
3 2219   Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?
3 2220   Rosse. You must haue patience Madam
3 2221 
3 2222    Wife. He had none:
3 2223 His flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,
3 2224 Our feares do make vs Traitors
3 2225 
3 2226    Rosse. You know not
3 2227 Whether it was his wisedome, or his feare
3 2228 
3 2229    Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,
3 2230 His Mansion, and his Titles, in a place
3 2231 From whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,
3 2232 He wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren
3 2233 (The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,
3 2234 Her yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:
3 2235 All is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;
3 2236 As little is the Wisedome, where the flight
3 2237 So runnes against all reason
3 2238 
3 2239    Rosse. My deerest Cooz,
3 2240 I pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,
3 2241 He is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes
3 2242 The fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,
3 2243 But cruell are the times, when we are Traitors
3 2244 And do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor
3 2245 From what we feare, yet know not what we feare,
3 2246 But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea
3 2247 Each way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:
3 2248 Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe:
3 2249 Things at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,
3 2250 To what they were before. My pretty Cosine,
3 2251 Blessing vpon you
3 2252 
3 2253    Wife. Father'd he is,
3 2254 And yet hee's Father-lesse
3 2255 
3 2256    Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay longer
3 2257 It would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.
3 2258 I take my leaue at once.
3 2259 
3 2260 Exit Rosse.
3 2261 
3 2262   Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,
3 2263 And what will you do now? How will you liue?
3 2264   Son. As Birds do Mother
3 2265 
3 2266    Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?
3 2267   Son. With what I get I meane, and so do they
3 2268 
3 2269    Wife. Poore Bird,
3 2270 Thou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,
3 2271 The Pitfall, nor the Gin
3 2272 
3 2273    Son. Why should I Mother?
3 2274 Poore Birds they are not set for:
3 2275 My Father is not dead for all your saying
3 2276 
3 2277    Wife. Yes, he is dead:
3 2278 How wilt thou do for a Father?
3 2279   Son. Nay how will you do for a Husband?
3 2280   Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market
3 2281 
3 2282    Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe
3 2283 
3 2284    Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,
3 2285 And yet I'faith with wit enough for thee
3 2286 
3 2287    Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?
3 2288   Wife. I, that he was
3 2289 
3 2290    Son. What is a Traitor?
3 2291   Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes
3 2292 
3 2293    Son. And be all Traitors, that do so
3 2294 
3 2295    Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,
3 2296 And must be hang'd
3 2297 
3 2298    Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?
3 2299   Wife. Euery one
3 2300 
3 2301    Son. Who must hang them?
3 2302   Wife. Why, the honest men
3 2303 
3 2304    Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there
3 2305 are Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,
3 2306 and hang vp them
3 2307 
3 2308    Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:
3 2309 But how wilt thou do for a Father?
3 2310   Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you
3 2311 would not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely
3 2312 haue a new Father
3 2313 
3 2314    Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?
3 2315 Enter a Messenger.
3 2316 
3 2317   Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,
3 2318 Though in your state of Honor I am perfect;
3 2319 I doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.
3 2320 If you will take a homely mans aduice,
3 2321 Be not found heere: Hence with your little ones
3 2322 To fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:
3 2323 To do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,
3 2324 Which is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,
3 2325 I dare abide no longer.
3 2326 
3 2327 Exit Messenger
3 2328 
3 2329   Wife. Whether should I flye?
3 2330 I haue done no harme. But I remember now
3 2331 I am in this earthly world: where to do harme
3 2332 Is often laudable, to do good sometime
3 2333 Accounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)
3 2334 Do I put vp that womanly defence,
3 2335 To say I haue done no harme?
3 2336 What are these faces?
3 2337 Enter Murtherers.
3 2338 
3 2339   Mur. Where is your Husband?
3 2340   Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,
3 2341 Where such as thou may'st finde him
3 2342 
3 2343    Mur. He's a Traitor
3 2344 
3 2345    Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine
3 2346 
3 2347    Mur. What you Egge?
3 2348 Yong fry of Treachery?
3 2349   Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,
3 2350 Run away I pray you.
3 2351 
3 2352 Exit crying Murther.
3 2353 
3 2354 
3 2355 Scaena Tertia.
3 2356 
3 2357 Enter Malcolme and Macduffe.
3 2358 
3 2359   Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there
3 2360 Weepe our sad bosomes empty
3 2361 
3 2362    Macd. Let vs rather
3 2363 Hold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,
3 2364 Bestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,
3 2365 New Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes
3 2366 Strike heauen on the face, that it resounds
3 2367 As if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out
3 2368 Like Syllable of Dolour
3 2369 
3 2370    Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;
3 2371 What know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,
3 2372 As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.
3 2373 What you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.
3 2374 This Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
3 2375 Was once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,
3 2376 He hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something
3 2377 You may discerne of him through me, and wisedome
3 2378 To offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe
3 2379 T' appease an angry God
3 2380 
3 2381    Macd. I am not treacherous
3 2382 
3 2383    Malc. But Macbeth is.
3 2384 A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle
3 2385 In an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:
3 2386 That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;
3 2387 Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
3 2388 Though all things foule, would wear the brows of grace
3 2389 Yet Grace must still looke so
3 2390 
3 2391    Macd. I haue lost my Hopes
3 2392 
3 2393    Malc. Perchance euen there
3 2394 Where I did finde my doubts.
3 2395 Why in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?
3 2396 Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,
3 2397 Without leaue-taking. I pray you,
3 2398 Let not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,
3 2399 But mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,
3 2400 What euer I shall thinke
3 2401 
3 2402    Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,
3 2403 Great Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,
3 2404 For goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,
3 2405 The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,
3 2406 I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,
3 2407 For the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,
3 2408 And the rich East to boot
3 2409 
3 2410    Mal. Be not offended:
3 2411 I speake not as in absolute feare of you:
3 2412 I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,
3 2413 It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
3 2414 Is added to her wounds. I thinke withall,
3 2415 There would be hands vplifted in my right:
3 2416 And heere from gracious England haue I offer
3 2417 Of goodly thousands. But for all this,
3 2418 When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,
3 2419 Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country
3 2420 Shall haue more vices then it had before,
3 2421 More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,
3 2422 By him that shall succeede
3 2423 
3 2424    Macd. What should he be?
3 2425   Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know
3 2426 All the particulars of Vice so grafted,
3 2427 That when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth
3 2428 Will seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State
3 2429 Esteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd
3 2430 With my confinelesse harmes
3 2431 
3 2432    Macd. Not in the Legions
3 2433 Of horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd
3 2434 In euils, to top Macbeth
3 2435 
3 2436    Mal. I grant him Bloody,
3 2437 Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,
3 2438 Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne
3 2439 That ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none
3 2440 In my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,
3 2441 Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp
3 2442 The Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire
3 2443 All continent Impediments would ore-beare
3 2444 That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,
3 2445 Then such an one to reigne
3 2446 
3 2447    Macd. Boundlesse intemperance
3 2448 In Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene
3 2449 Th' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,
3 2450 And fall of many Kings. But feare not yet
3 2451 To take vpon you what is yours: you may
3 2452 Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
3 2453 And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:
3 2454 We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be
3 2455 That Vulture in you, to deuoure so many
3 2456 As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,
3 2457 Finding it so inclinde
3 2458 
3 2459    Mal. With this, there growes
3 2460 In my most ill-composd Affection, such
3 2461 A stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,
3 2462 I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,
3 2463 Desire his Iewels, and this others House,
3 2464 And my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce
3 2465 To make me hunger more, that I should forge
3 2466 Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,
3 2467 Destroying them for wealth
3 2468 
3 2469    Macd. This Auarice
3 2470 stickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote
3 2471 Then Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin
3 2472 The Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,
3 2473 Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will
3 2474 Of your meere Owne. All these are portable,
3 2475 With other Graces weigh'd
3 2476 
3 2477    Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,
3 2478 As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,
3 2479 Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,
3 2480 Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,
3 2481 I haue no rellish of them, but abound
3 2482 In the diuision of each seuerall Crime,
3 2483 Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should
3 2484 Poure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,
3 2485 Vprore the vniuersall peace, confound
3 2486 All vnity on earth
3 2487 
3 2488    Macd. O Scotland, Scotland
3 2489 
3 2490    Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:
3 2491 I am as I haue spoken
3 2492 
3 2493    Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!
3 2494 With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,
3 2495 When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?
3 2496 Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne
3 2497 By his owne Interdiction stands accust,
3 2498 And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father
3 2499 Was a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,
3 2500 Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,
3 2501 Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,
3 2502 These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,
3 2503 Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,
3 2504 Thy hope ends heere
3 2505 
3 2506    Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion
3 2507 Childe of integrity, hath from my soule
3 2508 Wip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts
3 2509 To thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,
3 2510 By many of these traines, hath sought to win me
3 2511 Into his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me
3 2512 From ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue
3 2513 Deale betweene thee and me; For euen now
3 2514 I put my selfe to thy Direction, and
3 2515 Vnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure
3 2516 The taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,
3 2517 For strangers to my Nature. I am yet
3 2518 Vnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,
3 2519 Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.
3 2520 At no time broke my Faith, would not betray
3 2521 The Deuill to his Fellow, and delight
3 2522 No lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking
3 2523 Was this vpon my selfe. What I am truly
3 2524 Is thine, and my poore Countries to command:
3 2525 Whither indeed, before they heere approach
3 2526 Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men
3 2527 Already at a point, was setting foorth:
3 2528 Now wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse
3 2529 Be like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?
3 2530   Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once
3 2531 'Tis hard to reconcile.
3 2532 Enter a Doctor.
3 2533 
3 2534   Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth
3 2535 I pray you?
3 2536   Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules
3 2537 That stay his Cure: their malady conuinces
3 2538 The great assay of Art. But at his touch,
3 2539 Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,
3 2540 They presently amend.
3 2541 Enter.
3 2542 
3 2543   Mal. I thanke you Doctor
3 2544 
3 2545    Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?
3 2546   Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.
3 2547 A most myraculous worke in this good King,
3 2548 Which often since my heere remaine in England,
3 2549 I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen
3 2550 Himselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people
3 2551 All swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,
3 2552 The meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,
3 2553 Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes,
3 2554 Put on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken
3 2555 To the succeeding Royalty he leaues
3 2556 The healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,
3 2557 He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,
3 2558 And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,
3 2559 That speake him full of Grace.
3 2560 Enter Rosse.
3 2561 
3 2562   Macd. See who comes heere
3 2563 
3 2564    Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not
3 2565 
3 2566    Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither
3 2567 
3 2568    Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue
3 2569 The meanes that makes vs Strangers
3 2570 
3 2571    Rosse. Sir, Amen
3 2572 
3 2573    Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?
3 2574   Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,
3 2575 Almost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot
3 2576 Be call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing
3 2577 But who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:
3 2578 Where sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre
3 2579 Are made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes
3 2580 A Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,
3 2581 Is there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues
3 2582 Expire before the Flowers in their Caps,
3 2583 Dying, or ere they sicken
3 2584 
3 2585    Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true
3 2586 
3 2587    Malc. What's the newest griefe?
3 2588   Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,
3 2589 Each minute teemes a new one
3 2590 
3 2591    Macd. How do's my Wife?
3 2592   Rosse. Why well
3 2593 
3 2594    Macd. And all my Children?
3 2595   Rosse. Well too
3 2596 
3 2597    Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?
3 2598   Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em
3 2599   Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?
3 2600   Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings
3 2601 Which I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour
3 2602 Of many worthy Fellowes, that were out,
3 2603 Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,
3 2604 For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.
3 2605 Now is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland
3 2606 Would create Soldiours, make our women fight,
3 2607 To doffe their dire distresses
3 2608 
3 2609    Malc. Bee't their comfort
3 2610 We are comming thither: Gracious England hath
3 2611 Lent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,
3 2612 An older, and a better Souldier, none
3 2613 That Christendome giues out
3 2614 
3 2615    Rosse. Would I could answer
3 2616 This comfort with the like. But I haue words
3 2617 That would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,
3 2618 Where hearing should not latch them
3 2619 
3 2620    Macd. What concerne they,
3 2621 The generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe
3 2622 Due to some single brest?
3 2623   Rosse. No minde that's honest
3 2624 But in it shares some woe, though the maine part
3 2625 Pertaines to you alone
3 2626 
3 2627    Macd. If it be mine
3 2628 Keepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it
3 2629 
3 2630    Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,
3 2631 Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound
3 2632 that euer yet they heard
3 2633 
3 2634    Macd. Humh: I guesse at it
3 2635 
3 2636    Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes
3 2637 Sauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner
3 2638 Were on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere
3 2639 To adde the death of you
3 2640 
3 2641    Malc. Mercifull Heauen:
3 2642 What man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:
3 2643 Giue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,
3 2644 Whispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake
3 2645 
3 2646    Macd. My Children too?
3 2647   Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found
3 2648 
3 2649    Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?
3 2650   Rosse. I haue said
3 2651 
3 2652    Malc. Be comforted.
3 2653 Let's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,
3 2654 To cure this deadly greefe
3 2655 
3 2656    Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?
3 2657 Did you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?
3 2658 What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme
3 2659 At one fell swoope?
3 2660   Malc. Dispute it like a man
3 2661 
3 2662    Macd. I shall do so:
3 2663 But I must also feele it as a man;
3 2664 I cannot but remember such things were
3 2665 That were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,
3 2666 And would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,
3 2667 They were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,
3 2668 Not for their owne demerits, but for mine
3 2669 Fell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now
3 2670 
3 2671    Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe
3 2672 Conuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it
3 2673 
3 2674    Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,
3 2675 And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,
3 2676 Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,
3 2677 Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe
3 2678 Within my Swords length set him, if he scape
3 2679 Heauen forgiue him too
3 2680 
3 2681    Mal. This time goes manly:
3 2682 Come go we to the King, our Power is ready,
3 2683 Our lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth
3 2684 Is ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue
3 2685 Put on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,
3 2686 The Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.
3 2687 
3 2688 Exeunt.
3 2689 
3 2690 Actus Quintus. Scena Prima.
3 2691 
3 2692 Enter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.
3 2693 
3 2694   Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can
3 2695 perceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last
3 2696 walk'd?
3 2697   Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue
3 2698 seene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon
3 2699 her, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,
3 2700 write vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne
3 2701 to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe
3 2702 
3 2703    Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at
3 2704 once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.
3 2705 In this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other
3 2706 actuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard
3 2707 her say?
3 2708   Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her
3 2709 
3 2710    Doct. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should
3 2711 
3 2712    Gent. Neither to you, nor any one, hauing no witnesse
3 2713 to confirme my speech.
3 2714 Enter Lady, with a Taper.
3 2715 
3 2716 Lo you, heere she comes: This is her very guise, and vpon
3 2717 my life fast asleepe: obserue her, stand close
3 2718 
3 2719    Doct. How came she by that light?
3 2720   Gent. Why it stood by her: she ha's light by her continually,
3 2721 'tis her command
3 2722 
3 2723    Doct. You see her eyes are open
3 2724 
3 2725    Gent. I, but their sense are shut
3 2726 
3 2727    Doct. What is it she do's now?
3 2728 Looke how she rubbes her hands
3 2729 
3 2730    Gent. It is an accustom'd action with her, to seeme
3 2731 thus washing her hands: I haue knowne her continue in
3 2732 this a quarter of an houre
3 2733 
3 2734    Lad. Yet heere's a spot
3 2735 
3 2736    Doct. Heark, she speaks, I will set downe what comes
3 2737 from her, to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly
3 2738 
3 2739    La. Out damned spot: out I say. One: Two: Why
3 2740 then 'tis time to doo't: Hell is murky. Fye, my Lord, fie,
3 2741 a Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes
3 2742 it, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who
3 2743 would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much
3 2744 blood in him
3 2745 
3 2746    Doct. Do you marke that?
3 2747   Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?
3 2748 What will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that
3 2749 my Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this starting
3 2750 
3 2751    Doct. Go too, go too:
3 2752 You haue knowne what you should not
3 2753 
3 2754    Gent. She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure
3 2755 of that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne
3 2756 
3 2757    La. Heere's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes
3 2758 of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
3 2759 Oh, oh, oh
3 2760 
3 2761    Doct. What a sigh is there? The hart is sorely charg'd
3 2762 
3 2763    Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,
3 2764 for the dignity of the whole body
3 2765 
3 2766    Doct. Well, well, well
3 2767 
3 2768    Gent. Pray God it be sir
3 2769 
3 2770    Doct. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue
3 2771 knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue
3 2772 dyed holily in their beds
3 2773 
3 2774    Lad. Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,
3 2775 looke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;
3 2776 he cannot come out on's graue
3 2777 
3 2778    Doct. Euen so?
3 2779   Lady. To bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate:
3 2780 Come, come, come, come, giue me your hand: What's
3 2781 done, cannot be vndone. To bed, to bed, to bed.
3 2782 
3 2783 Exit Lady.
3 2784 
3 2785   Doct. Will she go now to bed?
3 2786   Gent. Directly
3 2787 
3 2788    Doct. Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds
3 2789 Do breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes
3 2790 To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:
3 2791 More needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:
3 2792 God, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,
3 2793 Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,
3 2794 And still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,
3 2795 My minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.
3 2796 I thinke, but dare not speake
3 2797 
3 2798    Gent. Good night good Doctor.

3 2810 Reuenges burne in them: for their deere causes
3 2811 Would to the bleeding, and the grim Alarme
3 2812 Excite the mortified man
3 2813 
3 2814    Ang. Neere Byrnan wood
3 2815 Shall we well meet them, that way are they comming
3 2816 
3 2817    Cath. Who knowes if Donalbane be with his brother?
3 2818   Len. For certaine Sir, he is not: I haue a File
3 2819 Of all the Gentry; there is Seywards Sonne,
3 2820 And many vnruffe youths, that euen now
3 2821 Protest their first of Manhood
3 2822 
3 2823    Ment. What do's the Tyrant
3 2824 
3 2825    Cath. Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies:
3 2826 Some say hee's mad: Others, that lesser hate him,
3 2827 Do call it valiant Fury, but for certaine
3 2828 He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
3 2829 Within the belt of Rule
3 2830 
3 2831    Ang. Now do's he feele
3 2832 His secret Murthers sticking on his hands,
3 2833 Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith-breach:
3 2834 Those he commands, moue onely in command,
3 2835 Nothing in loue: Now do's he feele his Title
3 2836 Hang loose about him, like a Giants Robe
3 2837 Vpon a dwarfish Theefe
3 2838 
3 2839    Ment. Who then shall blame
3 2840 His pester'd Senses to recoyle, and start,
3 2841 When all that is within him, do's condemne
3 2842 It selfe, for being there
3 2843 
3 2844    Cath. Well, march we on,
3 2845 To giue Obedience, where 'tis truly ow'd:
3 2846 Meet we the Med'cine of the sickly Weale,
3 2847 And with him poure we in our Countries purge,
3 2848 Each drop of vs

3 2858 
3 2859 Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.
3 2860 
3 2861   Macb. Bring me no more Reports, let them flye all:
3 2862 Till Byrnane wood remoue to Dunsinane,
3 2863 I cannot taint with Feare. What's the Boy Malcolme?
3 2864 Was he not borne of woman? The Spirits that know
3 2865 All mortall Consequences, haue pronounc'd me thus:
3 2866 Feare not Macbeth, no man that's borne of woman
3 2867 Shall ere haue power vpon thee. Then fly false Thanes,
3 2868 And mingle with the English Epicures,
3 2869 The minde I sway by, and the heart I beare,
3 2870 Shall neuer sagge with doubt, nor shake with feare.
3 2871 Enter Seruant.

3 2875 
3 2876    Ser. There is ten thousand
3 2877 
3 2878    Macb. Geese Villaine?
3 2879   Ser. Souldiers Sir
3 2880 
3 2881    Macb. Go pricke thy face, and ouer-red thy feare
3 2882 Thou Lilly-liuer'd Boy. What Soldiers, Patch?
3 2883 Death of thy Soule, those Linnen cheekes of thine
3 2884 Are Counsailers to feare. What Soldiers Whay-face?
3 2885   Ser. The English Force, so please you
3 2886 
3 2887    Macb. Take thy face hence. Seyton, I am sick at hart,
3 2888 When I behold: Seyton, I say, this push
3 2889 Will cheere me euer, or dis-eate me now.
3 2890 I haue liu'd long enough: my way of life
3 2891 Is falne into the Seare, the yellow Leafe,
3 2892 And that which should accompany Old-Age,
3 2893 As Honor, Loue, Obedience, Troopes of Friends,
3 2894 I must not looke to haue: but in their steed,
3 2895 Curses, not lowd but deepe, Mouth-honor, breath
3 2896 Which the poore heart would faine deny, and dare not.
3 2897 Seyton?
3 2898 Enter Seyton.
3 2899 
3 2900   Sey. What's your gracious pleasure?
3 2901   Macb. What Newes more?
3 2902   Sey. All is confirm'd my Lord, which was reported
3 2903 
3 2904    Macb. Ile fight, till from my bones, my flesh be hackt.
3 2905 Giue me my Armor
3 2906 
3 2907    Seyt. 'Tis not needed yet
3 2908 
3 2909    Macb. Ile put it on:
3 2910 Send out moe Horses, skirre the Country round,
3 2911 Hang those that talke of Feare. Giue me mine Armor:
3 2912 How do's your Patient, Doctor?
3 2913   Doct. Not so sicke my Lord,
3 2914 As she is troubled with thicke-comming Fancies
3 2915 That keepe her from her rest
3 2916 
3 2917    Macb. Cure of that:
3 2918 Can'st thou not Minister to a minde diseas'd,
3 2919 Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow,
3 2920 Raze out the written troubles of the Braine,
3 2921 And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote
3 2922 Cleanse the stufft bosome, of that perillous stuffe
3 2923 Which weighes vpon the heart?
3 2924   Doct. Therein the Patient
3 2925 Must minister to himselfe
3 2926 
3 2927    Macb. Throw Physicke to the Dogs, Ile none of it.
3 2928 Come, put mine Armour on: giue me my Staffe:
3 2929 Seyton, send out: Doctor, the Thanes flye from me:
3 2930 Come sir, dispatch. If thou could'st Doctor, cast
3 2931 The Water of my Land, finde her Disease,
3 2932 And purge it to a sound and pristine Health,
3 2933 I would applaud thee to the very Eccho,
3 2934 That should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,
3 2935 What Rubarb, Cyme, or what Purgatiue drugge
3 2936 Would scowre these English hence: hear'st y of them?
3 2937   Doct. I my good Lord: your Royall Preparation
3 2938 Makes vs heare something
3 2939 
3 2940    Macb. Bring it after me:
3 2941 I will not be affraid of Death and Bane,
3 2942 Till Birnane Forrest come to Dunsinane
3 2943 
3 2944    Doct. Were I from Dunsinane away, and cleere,

3 2961   Ment. The wood of Birnane
3 2962 
3 2963    Malc. Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough,
3 2964 And bear't before him, thereby shall we shadow
3 2965 The numbers of our Hoast, and make discouery
3 2966 Erre in report of vs
3 2967 
3 2968    Sold. It shall be done
3 2969 
3 2970    Syw. We learne no other, but the confident Tyrant
3 2971 Keepes still in Dunsinane, and will indure
3 2972 Our setting downe befor't
3 2973 
3 2974    Malc. 'Tis his maine hope:
3 2975 For where there is aduantage to be giuen,
3 2976 Both more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt,
3 2977 And none serue with him, but constrained things,
3 2978 Whose hearts are absent too
3 2979

3 2981 Attend the true euent, and put we on
3 2982 Industrious Souldiership
3 2983 
3 2984    Sey. The time approaches,
3 2985 That will with due decision make vs know
3 2986 What we shall say we haue, and what we owe:
3 2987 Thoughts speculatiue, their vnsure hopes relate,

3 2996 
3 2997   Macb. Hang out our Banners on the outward walls,
3 2998 The Cry is still, they come: our Castles strength
3 2999 Will laugh a Siedge to scorne: Heere let them lye,
3 3000 Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp:
3 3001 Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours,
3 3002 We might haue met them darefull, beard to beard,
3 3003 And beate them backward home. What is that noyse?
3 3004 
3 3005 A Cry within of Women.
3 3006 
3 3007   Sey. It is the cry of women, my good Lord
3 3008 
3 3009    Macb. I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:
3 3010 The time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'd
3 3011 To heare a Night-shrieke, and my Fell of haire
3 3012 Would at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirre
3 3013 As life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,
3 3014 Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
3 3015 Cannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?
3 3016   Sey. The Queene (my Lord) is dead
3 3017 
3 3018    Macb. She should haue dy'de heereafter;
3 3019 There would haue beene a time for such a word:
3 3020 To morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,
3 3021 Creepes in this petty pace from day to day,
3 3022 To the last Syllable of Recorded time:
3 3023 And all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles
3 3024 The way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,
3 3025 Life's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,
3 3026 That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,
3 3027 And then is heard no more. It is a Tale
3 3028 Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury
3 3029 Signifying nothing.
3 3030 Enter a Messenger.
3 3031 
3 3032 Thou com'st to vse thy Tongue: thy Story quickly
3 3033 
3 3034    Mes. Gracious my Lord,
3 3035 I should report that which I say I saw,
3 3036 But know not how to doo't
3 3037 
3 3038    Macb. Well, say sir
3 3039 
3 3040    Mes. As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill
3 3041 I look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thought
3 3042 The Wood began to moue
3 3043 
3 3044    Macb. Lyar, and Slaue
3 3045 
3 3046    Mes. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
3 3047 Within this three Mile may you see it comming.
3 3048 I say, a mouing Groue
3 3049 
3 3050    Macb. If thou speak'st false,
3 3051 Vpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue
3 3052 Till Famine cling thee: If thy speech be sooth,
3 3053 I care not if thou dost for me as much.
3 3054 I pull in Resolution, and begin
3 3055 To doubt th' Equiuocation of the Fiend,
3 3056 That lies like truth. Feare not, till Byrnane Wood
3 3057 Do come to Dunsinane, and now a Wood
3 3058 Comes toward Dunsinane. Arme, Arme, and out,
3 3059 If this which he auouches, do's appeare,
3 3060 There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.
3 3061 I 'ginne to be a-weary of the Sun,
3 3062 And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.
3 3063 Ring the Alarum Bell, blow Winde, come wracke,
3 3064 At least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.

3 3073 
3 3074   Mal. Now neere enough:
3 3075 Your leauy Skreenes throw downe,
3 3076 And shew like those you are: You (worthy Vnkle)
3 3077 Shall with my Cosin your right Noble Sonne
3 3078 Leade our first Battell. Worthy Macduffe, and wee
3 3079 Shall take vpon's what else remaines to do,
3 3080 According to our order
3 3081 
3 3082    Sey. Fare you well:
3 3083 Do we but finde the Tyrants power to night,
3 3084 Let vs be beaten, if we cannot fight
3 3085 
3 3086    Macd. Make all our Trumpets speak, giue the[m] all breath
3 3087 Those clamorous Harbingers of Blood, & Death.

3 3097 
3 3098   Macb. They haue tied me to a stake, I cannot flye,
3 3099 But Beare-like I must fight the course. What's he
3 3100 That was not borne of Woman? Such a one
3 3101 Am I to feare, or none.
3 3102 Enter young Seyward.
3 3103 
3 3104   Y.Sey. What is thy name?
3 3105   Macb. Thou'lt be affraid to heare it
3 3106 
3 3107    Y.Sey. No: though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter name
3 3108 Then any is in hell
3 3109 
3 3110    Macb. My name's Macbeth
3 3111 
3 3112    Y.Sey. The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title
3 3113 More hatefull to mine eare
3 3114 
3 3115    Macb. No: nor more fearefull
3 3116 
3 3117    Y.Sey. Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant, with my Sword
3 3118 Ile proue the lye thou speak'st.
3 3119 
3 3120 Fight, and young Seyward slaine.
3 3121 
3 3122   Macb. Thou was't borne of woman;
3 3123 But Swords I smile at, Weapons laugh to scorne,
3 3124 Brandish'd by man that's of a Woman borne.
3 3125 Enter.
3 3126 
3 3127 Alarums. Enter Macduffe.
3 3128 
3 3129   Macd. That way the noise is: Tyrant shew thy face,
3 3130 If thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,
3 3131 My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:
3 3132 I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armes
3 3133 Are hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou Macbeth,
3 3134 Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge
3 3135 I sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,
3 3136 By this great clatter, one of greatest note
3 3137 Seemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,
3 3138 And more I begge not.
3 3139 
3 3140 Exit. Alarums.
3 3141 
3 3142 Enter Malcolme and Seyward.
3 3143 
3 3144   Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:
3 3145 The Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,
3 3146 The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,
3 3147 The day almost it selfe professes yours,
3 3148 And little is to do
3 3149 
3 3150    Malc. We haue met with Foes

3 3157 Enter Macbeth.
3 3158 
3 3159   Macb. Why should I play the Roman Foole, and dye

3 3161 Do better vpon them.
3 3162 Enter Macduffe.
3 3163 
3 3164   Macd. Turne Hell-hound, turne
3 3165 
3 3166    Macb. Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:
3 3167 But get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'd
3 3168 With blood of thine already
3 3169 
3 3170    Macd. I haue no words,
3 3171 My voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier Villaine
3 3172 Then tearmes can giue thee out.
3 3173 
3 3174 Fight: Alarum
3 3175 
3 3176   Macb. Thou loosest labour
3 3177 As easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre
3 3178 With thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:
3 3179 Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,
3 3180 I beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeld
3 3181 To one of woman borne
3 3182 
3 3183    Macd. Dispaire thy Charme,
3 3184 And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd
3 3185 Tell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers womb
3 3186 Vntimely ript
3 3187 
3 3188    Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;
3 3189 For it hath Cow'd my better part of man:
3 3190 And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,
3 3191 That palter with vs in a double sence,
3 3192 That keepe the word of promise to our eare,
3 3193 And breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee
3 3194 
3 3195    Macd. Then yeeld thee Coward,
3 3196 And liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.
3 3197 Wee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters are
3 3198 Painted vpon a pole, and vnder-writ,
3 3199 Heere may you see the Tyrant
3 3200 
3 3201    Macb. I will not yeeld
3 3202 To kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet,
3 3203 And to be baited with the Rabbles curse.
3 3204 Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane,
3 3205 And thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,
3 3206 Yet I will try the last. Before my body,
3 3207 I throw my warlike Shield: Lay on Macduffe,
3 3208 And damn'd be him, that first cries hold, enough.
3 3209 
3 3210 Exeunt. fighting. Alarums.
3 3211 
3 3212 Enter Fighting, and Macbeth slaine.
3 3213 
3 3214 Retreat, and Flourish. Enter with Drumme and Colours, Malcolm,
3 3215 Seyward,
3 3216 Rosse, Thanes, & Soldiers.
3 3217 
3 3218   Mal. I would the Friends we misse, were safe arriu'd
3 3219 
3 3220    Sey. Some must go off: and yet by these I see,
3 3221 So great a day as this is cheapely bought
3 3222 
3 3223    Mal. Macduffe is missing, and your Noble Sonne
3 3224 
3 3225    Rosse. Your son my Lord, ha's paid a souldiers debt,
3 3226 He onely liu'd but till he was a man,
3 3227 The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'd
3 3228 In the vnshrinking station where he fought,
3 3229 But like a man he dy'de
3 3230 
3 3231    Sey. Then he is dead?
3 3232   Rosse. I, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
3 3233 Must not be measur'd by his worth, for then
3 3234 It hath no end
3 3235 
3 3236    Sey. Had he his hurts before?
3 3237   Rosse. I, on the Front
3 3238 
3 3239    Sey. Why then, Gods Soldier be he:
3 3240 Had I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,
3 3241 I would not wish them to a fairer death:
3 3242 And so his Knell is knoll'd
3 3243 
3 3244    Mal. Hee's worth more sorrow,
3 3245 and that Ile spend for him
3 3246 
3 3247    Sey. He's worth no more,
3 3248 They say he parted well, and paid his score,
3 3249 And so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.
3 3250 Enter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.
3 3251 
3 3252   Macd. Haile King, for so thou art.
3 3253 Behold where stands
3 3254 Th' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:
3 3255 I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,
3 3256 That speake my salutation in their minds:
3 3257 Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine.
3 3258 Haile King of Scotland
3 3259 
3 3260    All. Haile King of Scotland.
3 3261 
3 3262 Flourish.
3 3263 
3 3264   Mal. We shall not spend a large expence of time,
3 3265 Before we reckon with your seuerall loues,
3 3266 And make vs euen with you. My Thanes and Kinsmen
3 3267 Henceforth be Earles, the first that euer Scotland
3 3268 In such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,
3 3269 Which would be planted newly with the time,
3 3270 As calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,
3 3271 That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny,
3 3272 Producing forth the cruell Ministers
3 3273 Of this dead Butcher, and his Fiend-like Queene;
3 3274 Who (as 'tis thought) by selfe and violent hands,
3 3275 Tooke off her life. This, and what need full else
3 3276 That call's vpon vs, by the Grace of Grace,
3 3277 We will performe in measure, time, and place:
3 3278 So thankes to all at once, and to each one,
3 3279 Whom we inuite, to see vs Crown'd at Scone.
3 3280 
3 3281 Flourish. Exeunt Omnes.
3 3282 
3 3283 
3 3284 FINIS. THE TRAGEDIE OF MACBETH.
