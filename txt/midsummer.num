7 0 ï»¿A Midsommer Nights Dreame
7 1 
7 2 Actus primus.
7 3 
7 4 Enter Theseus, Hippolita, with others.
7 5 
7 6   Theseus. Now faire Hippolita, our nuptiall houre
7 7 Drawes on apace: foure happy daies bring in
7 8 Another Moon: but oh, me thinkes, how slow
7 9 This old Moon wanes; She lingers my desires
7 10 Like to a Step-dame, or a Dowager,
7 11 Long withering out a yong mans reuennew
7 12 
7 13    Hip. Foure daies wil quickly steep the[m]selues in nights
7 14 Foure nights wil quickly dreame away the time:
7 15 And then the Moone, like to a siluer bow,
7 16 Now bent in heauen, shal behold the night
7 17 Of our solemnities
7 18 
7 19    The. Go Philostrate,
7 20 Stirre vp the Athenian youth to merriments,
7 21 Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,
7 22 Turne melancholy forth to Funerals:
7 23 The pale companion is not for our pompe,
7 24 Hippolita, I woo'd thee with my sword,
7 25 And wonne thy loue, doing thee iniuries:
7 26 But I will wed thee in another key,
7 27 With pompe, with triumph, and with reuelling.
7 28 Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, Lysander, and Demetrius.
7 29 
7 30   Ege. Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke
7 31 
7 32    The. Thanks good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
7 33   Ege. Full of vexation, come I, with complaint
7 34 Against my childe, my daughter Hermia.
7 35 
7 36 Stand forth Demetrius.
7 37 
7 38 My Noble Lord,
7 39 This man hath my consent to marrie her.
7 40 
7 41 Stand forth Lysander.
7 42 
7 43 And my gracious Duke,
7 44 This man hath bewitch'd the bosome of my childe:
7 45 Thou, thou Lysander, thou hast giuen her rimes,
7 46 And interchang'd loue-tokens with my childe:
7 47 Thou hast by Moone-light at her window sung,
7 48 With faining voice, verses of faining loue,
7 49 And stolne the impression of her fantasie,
7 50 With bracelets of thy haire, rings, gawdes, conceits,
7 51 Knackes, trifles, Nose-gaies, sweet meats (messengers
7 52 Of strong preuailment in vnhardned youth)
7 53 With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughters heart,
7 54 Turn'd her obedience (which is due to me)
7 55 To stubborne harshnesse. And my gracious Duke,
7 56 Be it so she will not heere before your Grace,
7 57 Consent to marrie with Demetrius,
7 58 I beg the ancient priuiledge of Athens;
7 59 As she is mine, I may dispose of her;
7 60 Which shall be either to this Gentleman,
7 61 Or to her death, according to our Law,
7 62 Immediately prouided in that case
7 63 
7 64    The. What say you Hermia? be aduis'd faire Maide,
7 65 To you your Father should be as a God;
7 66 One that compos'd your beauties; yea and one
7 67 To whom you are but as a forme in waxe
7 68 By him imprinted: and within his power,
7 69 To leaue the figure, or disfigure it:
7 70 Demetrius is a worthy Gentleman
7 71 
7 72    Her. So is Lysander
7 73 
7 74    The. In himselfe he is.
7 75 But in this kinde, wanting your fathers voyce,
7 76 The other must be held the worthier
7 77 
7 78    Her. I would my father look'd but with my eyes
7 79 
7 80    The. Rather your eies must with his iudgment looke
7 81 
7 82    Her. I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
7 83 I know not by what power I am made bold,
7 84 Nor how it may concerne my modestie
7 85 In such a presence heere to pleade my thoughts:
7 86 But I beseech your Grace, that I may know
7 87 The worst that may befall me in this case,
7 88 If I refuse to wed Demetrius
7 89 
7 90    The. Either to dye the death, or to abiure
7 91 For euer the society of men.
7 92 Therefore faire Hermia question your desires,
7 93 Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
7 94 Whether (if you yeeld not to your fathers choice)
7 95 You can endure the liuerie of a Nunne,
7 96 For aye to be in shady Cloister mew'd,
7 97 To liue a barren sister all your life,
7 98 Chanting faint hymnes to the cold fruitlesse Moone,
7 99 Thrice blessed they that master so their blood,
7 100 To vndergo such maiden pilgrimage,
7 101 But earthlier happie is the Rose distil'd,
7 102 Then that which withering on the virgin thorne,
7 103 Growes, liues, and dies, in single blessednesse
7 104 
7 105    Her. So will I grow, so liue, so die my Lord,
7 106 Ere I will yeeld my virgin Patent vp
7 107 Vnto his Lordship, whose vnwished yoake,
7 108 My soule consents not to giue soueraignty
7 109 
7 110    The. Take time to pause, and by the next new Moon
7 111 The sealing day betwixt my loue and me,
7 112 For euerlasting bond of fellowship:
7 113 Vpon that day either prepare to dye,
7 114 For disobedience to your fathers will,
7 115 Or else to wed Demetrius as hee would,
7 116 Or on Dianaes Altar to protest
7 117 For aie, austerity, and single life
7 118 
7 119    Dem. Relent sweet Hermia, and Lysander, yeelde
7 120 Thy crazed title to my certaine right
7 121 
7 122    Lys. You haue her fathers loue, Demetrius:
7 123 Let me haue Hermiaes: do you marry him
7 124 
7 125    Egeus. Scornfull Lysander, true, he hath my Loue;
7 126 And what is mine, my loue shall render him.
7 127 And she is mine, and all my right of her,
7 128 I do estate vnto Demetrius
7 129 
7 130    Lys. I am my Lord, as well deriu'd as he,
7 131 As well possest: my loue is more then his:
7 132 My fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd
7 133 (If not with vantage) as Demetrius:
7 134 And (which is more then all these boasts can be)
7 135 I am belou'd of beauteous Hermia.
7 136 Why should not I then prosecute my right?
7 137 Demetrius, Ile auouch it to his head,
7 138 Made loue to Nedars daughter, Helena,
7 139 And won her soule: and she (sweet Ladie) dotes,
7 140 Deuoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry,
7 141 Vpon this spotted and inconstant man
7 142 
7 143    The. I must confesse, that I haue heard so much,
7 144 And with Demetrius thought to haue spoke thereof:
7 145 But being ouer-full of selfe-affaires,
7 146 My minde did lose it. But Demetrius come,
7 147 And come Egeus, you shall go with me,
7 148 I haue some priuate schooling for you both.
7 149 For you faire Hermia, looke you arme your selfe,
7 150 To fit your fancies to your Fathers will;
7 151 Or else the Law of Athens yeelds you vp
7 152 (Which by no meanes we may extenuate)
7 153 To death, or to a vow of single life.
7 154 Come my Hippolita, what cheare my loue?
7 155 Demetrius and Egeus go along:
7 156 I must imploy you in some businesse
7 157 Against our nuptiall, and conferre with you
7 158 Of something, neerely that concernes your selues
7 159 
7 160    Ege. With dutie and desire we follow you.
7 161 
7 162 Exeunt.
7 163 
7 164 Manet Lysander and Hermia.
7 165 
7 166   Lys. How now my loue? Why is your cheek so pale?
7 167 How chance the Roses there do fade so fast?
7 168   Her. Belike for want of raine, which I could well
7 169 Beteeme them, from the tempest of mine eyes
7 170 
7 171    Lys. For ought that euer I could reade,
7 172 Could euer heare by tale or historie,
7 173 The course of true loue neuer did run smooth,
7 174 But either it was different in blood
7 175 
7 176    Her. O crosse! too high to be enthral'd to loue
7 177 
7 178    Lys. Or else misgraffed, in respect of yeares
7 179 
7 180    Her. O spight! too old to be ingag'd to yong
7 181 
7 182    Lys. Or else it stood vpon the choise of merit
7 183 
7 184    Her. O hell! to choose loue by anothers eie
7 185 
7 186    Lys. Or if there were a simpathie in choise,
7 187 Warre, death, or sicknesse, did lay siege to it;
7 188 Making it momentarie, as a sound:
7 189 Swift as a shadow, short as any dreame,
7 190 Briefe as the lightning in the collied night,
7 191 That (in a spleene) vnfolds both heauen and earth;
7 192 And ere a man hath power to say, behold,
7 193 The iawes of darkness do deuoure it vp:
7 194 So quicke bright things come to confusion
7 195 
7 196    Her. If then true Louers haue beene euer crost,
7 197 It stands as an edict in destinie:
7 198 Then let vs teach our triall patience,
7 199 Because it is a customarie crosse,
7 200 As due to loue, as thoughts, and dreames, and sighes,
7 201 Wishes and teares; poore Fancies followers
7 202 
7 203    Lys. A good perswasion; therefore heare me Hermia,
7 204 I haue a Widdow Aunt, a dowager,
7 205 Of great reuennew, and she hath no childe,
7 206 From Athens is her house remou'd seuen leagues,
7 207 And she respects me, as her onely sonne:
7 208 There gentle Hermia, may I marrie thee,
7 209 And to that place, the sharpe Athenian Law
7 210 Cannot pursue vs. If thou lou'st me, then
7 211 Steale forth thy Fathers house to morrow night:
7 212 And in the wood, a league without the towne,
7 213 (Where I did meete thee once with Helena.
7 214 To do obseruance for a morne of May)
7 215 There will I stay for thee
7 216 
7 217    Her. My good Lysander,
7 218 I sweare to thee, by Cupids strongest bow,
7 219 By his best arrow with the golden head,
7 220 By the simplicitie of Venus Doues,
7 221 By that which knitteth soules, and prospers loue,
7 222 And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queene,
7 223 When the false Troyan vnder saile was seene,
7 224 By all the vowes that euer men haue broke,
7 225 (In number more then euer women spoke)
7 226 In that same place thou hast appointed me,
7 227 To morrow truly will I meete with thee
7 228 
7 229    Lys. Keepe promise loue: looke here comes Helena.
7 230 Enter Helena.
7 231 
7 232   Her. God speede faire Helena, whither away?
7 233   Hel. Cal you me faire? that faire againe vnsay,
7 234 Demetrius loues you faire: O happie faire!
7 235 Your eyes are loadstarres, and your tongues sweete ayre
7 236 More tuneable then Larke to shepheards eare,
7 237 When wheate is greene, when hauthorne buds appeare,
7 238 Sicknesse is catching: O were fauor so,
7 239 Your words I catch, faire Hermia ere I go,
7 240 My eare should catch your voice, my eye, your eye,
7 241 My tongue should catch your tongues sweete melodie,
7 242 Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
7 243 The rest Ile giue to be to you translated.
7 244 O teach me how you looke, and with what art
7 245 You sway the motion of Demetrius hart
7 246 
7 247    Her. I frowne vpon him, yet he loues me still
7 248 
7 249    Hel. O that your frownes would teach my smiles
7 250 such skil
7 251 
7 252    Her. I giue him curses, yet he giues me loue
7 253 
7 254    Hel. O that my prayers could such affection mooue
7 255 
7 256    Her. The more I hate, the more he followes me
7 257 
7 258    Hel. The more I loue, the more he hateth me
7 259 
7 260    Her. His folly Helena is none of mine
7 261 
7 262    Hel. None but your beauty, wold that fault wer mine
7 263   Her. Take comfort: he no more shall see my face,
7 264 Lysander and my selfe will flie this place.
7 265 Before the time I did Lysander see,
7 266 Seem'd Athens like a Paradise to mee.
7 267 O then, what graces in my Loue do dwell,
7 268 That he hath turn'd a heauen into hell
7 269 
7 270    Lys. Helen, to you our mindes we will vnfold,
7 271 To morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
7 272 Her siluer visage, in the watry glasse,
7 273 Decking with liquid pearle, the bladed grasse
7 274 (A time that Louers flights doth still conceale)
7 275 Through Athens gates, haue we deuis'd to steale
7 276 
7 277    Her. And in the wood, where often you and I,
7 278 Vpon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lye,
7 279 Emptying our bosomes, of their counsell sweld:
7 280 There my Lysander, and my selfe shall meete,
7 281 And thence from Athens turne away our eyes
7 282 To seeke new friends and strange companions,
7 283 Farwell sweet play-fellow, pray thou for vs,
7 284 And good lucke grant thee thy Demetrius.
7 285 Keepe word Lysander we must starue our sight,
7 286 From louers foode, till morrow deepe midnight.
7 287 
7 288 Exit Hermia.
7 289 
7 290   Lys. I will my Hermia. Helena adieu,
7 291 As you on him, Demetrius dotes on you.
7 292 
7 293 Exit Lysander.
7 294 
7 295   Hele. How happy some, ore othersome can be?
7 296 Through Athens I am thought as faire as she.
7 297 But what of that? Demetrius thinkes not so:
7 298 He will not know, what all, but he doth know,
7 299 And as hee erres, doting on Hermias eyes;
7 300 So I, admiring of his qualities:
7 301 Things base and vilde, holding no quantity,
7 302 Loue can transpose to forme and dignity,
7 303 Loue lookes not with the eyes, but with the minde,
7 304 And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blinde.
7 305 Nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste:
7 306 Wings and no eyes, figure, vnheedy haste.
7 307 And therefore is Loue said to be a childe,
7 308 Because in choise he is often beguil'd,
7 309 As waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare;
7 310 So the boy Loue is periur'd euery where.
7 311 For ere Demetrius lookt on Hermias eyne,
7 312 He hail'd downe oathes that he was onely mine.
7 313 And when this Haile some heat from Hermia felt,
7 314 So he dissolu'd, and showres of oathes did melt,
7 315 I will goe tell him of faire Hermias flight:
7 316 Then to the wood will he, to morrow night
7 317 Pursue her; and for his intelligence,
7 318 If I haue thankes, it is a deere expence:
7 319 But heerein meane I to enrich my paine,
7 320 To haue his sight thither, and backe againe.
7 321 Enter.
7 322 
7 323 Enter Quince the Carpenter, Snug the Ioyner, Bottome the Weauer,
7 324 Flute
7 325 the bellowes-mender, Snout the Tinker, and Starueling the Taylor.
7 326 
7 327   Quin. Is all our company heere?
7 328   Bot. You were best to call them generally, man by
7 329 man according to the scrip
7 330 
7 331    Qui. Here is the scrowle of euery mans name, which
7 332 is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our Enterlude
7 333 before the Duke and the Dutches, on his wedding
7 334 day at night
7 335 
7 336    Bot. First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
7 337 on: then read the names of the Actors: and so grow on
7 338 to a point
7 339 
7 340    Quin. Marry our play is the most lamentable comedy,
7 341 and most cruell death of Pyramus and Thisbie
7 342 
7 343    Bot. A very good peece of worke I assure you, and a
7 344 merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your Actors
7 345 by the scrowle. Masters spread your selues
7 346 
7 347    Quince. Answere as I call you. Nick Bottome the
7 348 Weauer
7 349 
7 350    Bottome. Ready; name what part I am for, and
7 351 proceed
7 352 
7 353    Quince. You Nicke Bottome are set downe for Pyramus
7 354 
7 355    Bot. What is Pyramus, a louer, or a tyrant?
7 356   Quin. A Louer that kills himselfe most gallantly for
7 357 loue
7 358 
7 359    Bot. That will aske some teares in the true performing
7 360 of it: if I do it, let the audience looke to their eies:
7 361 I will mooue stormes; I will condole in some measure.
7 362 To the rest yet, my chiefe humour is for a tyrant. I could
7 363 play Ercles rarely, or a part to teare a Cat in, to make all
7 364 split the raging Rocks; and shiuering shocks shall break
7 365 the locks of prison gates, and Phibbus carre shall shine
7 366 from farre, and make and marre the foolish Fates. This
7 367 was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This
7 368 is Ercles vaine, a tyrants vaine: a louer is more condoling
7 369 
7 370    Quin. Francis Flute the Bellowes-mender
7 371 
7 372    Flu. Heere Peter Quince
7 373 
7 374    Quin. You must take Thisbie on you
7 375 
7 376    Flut. What is Thisbie, a wandring Knight?
7 377   Quin. It is the Lady that Pyramus must loue
7 378 
7 379    Flut. Nay faith, let not mee play a woman, I haue a
7 380 beard comming
7 381 
7 382    Qui. That's all one, you shall play it in a Maske, and
7 383 you may speake as small as you will
7 384 
7 385    Bot. And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbie too:
7 386 Ile speake in a monstrous little voyce; Thisne, Thisne, ah
7 387 Pyramus my louer deare, thy Thisbie deare, and Lady
7 388 deare
7 389 
7 390    Quin. No no, you must play Pyramus, and Flute, you
7 391 Thisby
7 392 
7 393    Bot. Well, proceed
7 394 
7 395    Qu. Robin Starueling the Taylor
7 396 
7 397    Star. Heere Peter Quince
7 398 
7 399    Quince. Robin Starueling, you must play Thisbies
7 400 mother?
7 401 Tom Snowt, the Tinker
7 402 
7 403    Snowt. Heere Peter Quince
7 404 
7 405    Quin. you, Pyramus father; my self, Thisbies father;
7 406 Snugge the Ioyner, you the Lyons part: and I hope there
7 407 is a play fitted
7 408 
7 409    Snug. Haue you the Lions part written? pray you if
7 410 be, giue it me, for I am slow of studie
7 411 
7 412    Quin. You may doe it extemporie, for it is nothing
7 413 but roaring
7 414 
7 415    Bot. Let mee play the Lyon too, I will roare that I
7 416 will doe any mans heart good to heare me. I will roare,
7 417 that I will make the Duke say, Let him roare againe, let
7 418 him roare againe
7 419 
7 420    Quin. If you should do it too terribly, you would
7 421 fright the Dutchesse and the Ladies, that they would
7 422 shrike, and that were enough to hang us all
7 423 
7 424    All. That would hang vs euery mothers sonne
7 425 
7 426    Bottome. I graunt you friends, if that you should
7 427 fright the Ladies out of their Wittes, they would
7 428 haue no more discretion but to hang vs: but I will aggrauate
7 429 my voyce so, that I will roare you as gently as
7 430 any sucking Doue; I will roare and 'twere any Nightingale
7 431 
7 432    Quin. You can play no part but Piramus, for Piramus
7 433 is a sweet-fac'd man, a proper man as one shall see in
7 434 a summers day; a most louely Gentleman-like man, therfore
7 435 you must needs play Piramus
7 436 
7 437    Bot. Well, I will vndertake it. What beard were I
7 438 best to play it in?
7 439   Quin. Why, what you will
7 440 
7 441    Bot. I will discharge it, in either your straw-colour
7 442 beard, your orange tawnie beard, your purple in graine
7 443 beard, or your French-crowne colour'd beard, your perfect
7 444 yellow
7 445 
7 446    Quin. Some of your French Crownes haue no haire
7 447 at all, and then you will play bare-fac'd. But masters here
7 448 are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and
7 449 desire you, to con them by too morrow night: and meet
7 450 me in the palace wood, a mile without the Towne, by
7 451 Moone-light, there we will rehearse: for if we meete in
7 452 the Citie, we shalbe dog'd with company, and our deuises
7 453 knowne. In the meane time, I wil draw a bil of properties,
7 454 such as our play wants. I pray you faile me not
7 455 
7 456    Bottom. We will meete, and there we may rehearse
7 457 more obscenely and couragiously. Take paines, be perfect,
7 458 adieu
7 459 
7 460    Quin. At the Dukes oake we meete
7 461 
7 462    Bot. Enough, hold or cut bow-strings.
7 463 
7 464 Exeunt.
7 465 
7 466 Actus Secundus.
7 467 
7 468 Enter a Fairie at one dore, and Robin goodfellow at another.
7 469 
7 470   Rob. How now spirit, whether wander you?
7 471   Fai. Ouer hil, ouer dale, through bush, through briar,
7 472 Ouer parke, ouer pale, through flood, through fire,
7 473 I do wander euerie where, swifter then y Moons sphere;
7 474 And I serue the Fairy Queene, to dew her orbs vpon the green.
7 475 The Cowslips tall, her pensioners bee,
7 476 In their gold coats, spots you see,
7 477 Those be Rubies, Fairie fauors,
7 478 In those freckles, liue their sauors,
7 479 I must go seeke some dew drops heere,
7 480 And hang a pearle in euery cowslips eare.
7 481 Farewell thou Lob of spirits, Ile be gon,
7 482 Our Queene and all her Elues come heere anon
7 483 
7 484    Rob. The King doth keepe his Reuels here to night,
7 485 Take heed the Queene come not within his sight,
7 486 For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
7 487 Because that she, as her attendant, hath
7 488 A louely boy stolne from an Indian King,
7 489 She neuer had so sweet a changeling,
7 490 And iealous Oberon would haue the childe
7 491 Knight of his traine, to trace the Forrests wilde.
7 492 But she (perforce) with-holds the loued boy,
7 493 Crownes him with flowers, and makes him all her ioy.
7 494 And now they neuer meete in groue, or greene,
7 495 By fountaine cleere, or spangled star-light sheene,
7 496 But they do square, that all their Elues for feare
7 497 Creepe into Acorne cups and hide them there
7 498 
7 499    Fai. Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
7 500 Or else you are that shrew'd and knauish spirit
7 501 Cal'd Robin Good-fellow. Are you not hee,
7 502 That frights the maidens of the Villagree,
7 503 Skim milke, and sometimes labour in the querne,
7 504 And bootlesse make the breathlesse huswife cherne,
7 505 And sometime make the drinke to beare no barme,
7 506 Misleade night-wanderers, laughing at their harme,
7 507 Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Pucke,
7 508 You do their worke, and they shall haue good lucke.
7 509 Are not you he?
7 510   Rob. Thou speak'st aright;
7 511 I am that merrie wanderer of the night:
7 512 I iest to Oberon, and make him smile,
7 513 When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
7 514 Neighing in likenesse of a silly foale,
7 515 And sometime lurke I in a Gossips bole,
7 516 In very likenesse of a roasted crab:
7 517 And when she drinkes, against her lips I bob,
7 518 And on her withered dewlop poure the Ale.
7 519 The wisest Aunt telling the saddest tale,
7 520 Sometime for three-foot stoole, mistaketh me,
7 521 Then slip I from her bum, downe topples she,
7 522 And tailour cries, and fals into a coffe.
7 523 And then the whole quire hold their hips, and loffe,
7 524 And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and sweare,
7 525 A merrier houre was neuer wasted there.
7 526 But roome Fairy, heere comes Oberon
7 527 
7 528    Fair. And heere my Mistris:
7 529 Would that he were gone.
7 530 Enter the King of Fairies at one doore with his traine, and the
7 531 Queene at
7 532 another with hers.
7 533 
7 534   Ob. Ill met by Moone-light.
7 535 Proud Tytania
7 536 
7 537    Qu. What, iealous Oberon? Fairy skip hence.
7 538 I haue forsworne his bed and companie
7 539 
7 540    Ob. Tarrie rash Wanton; am not I thy Lord?
7 541   Qu. Then I must be thy Lady: but I know
7 542 When thou wast stolne away from Fairy Land,
7 543 And in the shape of Corin, sate all day,
7 544 Playing on pipes of Corne, and versing loue
7 545 To amorous Phillida. Why art thou heere
7 546 Come from the farthest steepe of India?
7 547 But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
7 548 Your buskin'd Mistresse, and your Warrior loue,
7 549 To Theseus must be Wedded; and you come,
7 550 To giue their bed ioy and prosperitie
7 551 
7 552    Ob. How canst thou thus for shame Tytania.
7 553 Glance at my credite, with Hippolita?
7 554 Knowing I know thy loue to Theseus?
7 555 Didst thou not leade him through the glimmering night
7 556 From Peregenia, whom he rauished?
7 557 And make him with faire Eagles breake his faith
7 558 With Ariadne, and Antiopa?
7 559   Que. These are the forgeries of iealousie,
7 560 And neuer since the middle Summers spring
7 561 Met we on hil, in dale, forrest, or mead,
7 562 By paued fountaine, or by rushie brooke,
7 563 Or in the beached margent of the sea,
7 564 To dance our ringlets to the whistling Winde,
7 565 But with thy braules thou hast disturb'd our sport.
7 566 Therefore the Windes, piping to vs in vaine,
7 567 As in reuenge, haue suck'd vp from the sea
7 568 Contagious fogges: Which falling in the Land,
7 569 Hath euerie petty Riuer made so proud,
7 570 That they haue ouer-borne their Continents.
7 571 The Oxe hath therefore stretch'd his yoake in vaine,
7 572 The Ploughman lost his sweat, and the greene Corne
7 573 Hath rotted, ere his youth attain'd a beard:
7 574 The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
7 575 And Crowes are fatted with the murrion flocke,
7 576 The nine mens Morris is fild vp with mud,
7 577 And the queint Mazes in the wanton greene,
7 578 For lacke of tread are vndistinguishable.
7 579 The humane mortals want their winter heere,
7 580 No night is now with hymne or caroll blest;
7 581 Therefore the Moone (the gouernesse of floods)
7 582 Pale in her anger, washes all the aire;
7 583 That Rheumaticke diseases doe abound.
7 584 And through this distemperature, we see
7 585 The seasons alter; hoared headed Frosts
7 586 Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose,
7 587 And on old Hyems chinne and Icie crowne,
7 588 An odorous Chaplet of sweet Sommer buds
7 589 Is as in mockry set. The Spring, the Sommer,
7 590 The childing Autumne, angry Winter change
7 591 Their wonted Liueries, and the mazed world,
7 592 By their increase, now knowes not which is which;
7 593 And this same progeny of euills,
7 594 Comes from our debate, from our dissention,
7 595 We are their parents and originall
7 596 
7 597    Ober. Do you amend it then, it lies in you,
7 598 Why should Titania crosse her Oberon?
7 599 I do but beg a little changeling boy,
7 600 To be my Henchman
7 601 
7 602    Qu. Set your heart at rest,
7 603 The Fairy land buyes not the childe of me,
7 604 His mother was a Votresse of my Order,
7 605 And in the spiced Indian aire, by night
7 606 Full often hath she gossipt by my side,
7 607 And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands,
7 608 Marking th' embarked traders on the flood,
7 609 When we haue laught to see the sailes conceiue,
7 610 And grow big bellied with the wanton winde:
7 611 Which she with pretty and with swimming gate,
7 612 Following (her wombe then rich with my yong squire)
7 613 Would imitate, and saile vpon the Land,
7 614 To fetch me trifles, and returne againe,
7 615 As from a voyage, rich with merchandize.
7 616 But she being mortall, of that boy did die,
7 617 And for her sake I doe reare vp her boy,
7 618 And for her sake I will not part with him
7 619 
7 620    Ob. How long within this wood intend you stay?
7 621   Qu. Perchance till after Theseus wedding day.
7 622 If you will patiently dance in our Round,
7 623 And see our Moone-light reuels, goe with vs;
7 624 If not, shun me and I will spare your haunts
7 625 
7 626    Ob. Giue me that boy, and I will goe with thee
7 627 
7 628    Qu. Not for thy Fairy Kingdome. Fairies away:
7 629 We shall chide downe right, if I longer stay.
7 630 
7 631 Exeunt
7 632 
7 633    Ob. Wel, go thy way: thou shalt not from this groue,
7 634 Till I torment thee for this iniury.
7 635 My gentle Pucke come hither; thou remembrest
7 636 Since once I sat vpon a promontory,
7 637 And heard a Meare-maide on a Dolphins backe,
7 638 Vttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,
7 639 That the rude sea grew ciuill at her song,
7 640 And certaine starres shot madly from their Spheares,
7 641 To heare the Sea-maids musicke
7 642 
7 643    Puc. I remember
7 644 
7 645    Ob. That very time I say (but thou couldst not)
7 646 Flying betweene the cold Moone and the earth,
7 647 Cupid all arm'd; a certaine aime he tooke
7 648 At a faire Vestall, throned by the West,
7 649 And loos'd his loue-shaft smartly from his bow,
7 650 As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts,
7 651 But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft
7 652 Quencht in the chaste beames of the watry Moone;
7 653 And the imperiall Votresse passed on,
7 654 In maiden meditation, fancy free.
7 655 Yet markt I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
7 656 It fell vpon a little westerne flower;
7 657 Before, milke-white: now purple with loues wound,
7 658 And maidens call it, Loue in idlenesse.
7 659 Fetch me that flower; the hearb I shew'd thee once,
7 660 The iuyce of it, on sleeping eye-lids laid,
7 661 Will make or man or woman madly dote
7 662 Vpon the next liue creature that it sees.
7 663 Fetch me this hearbe, and be thou heere againe,
7 664 Ere the Leuiathan can swim a league
7 665 
7 666    Pucke. Ile put a girdle about the earth, in forty minutes
7 667 
7 668    Ober. Hauing once this iuyce,
7 669 Ile watch Titania, when she is asleepe,
7 670 And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
7 671 The next thing when she waking lookes vpon,
7 672 (Be it on Lyon, Beare, or Wolfe, or Bull,
7 673 On medling Monkey, or on busie Ape)
7 674 Shee shall pursue it, with the soule of loue.
7 675 And ere I take this charme off from her sight,
7 676 (As I can take it with another hearbe)
7 677 Ile make her render vp her Page to me.
7 678 But who comes heere? I am inuisible,
7 679 And I will ouer-heare their conference.
7 680 Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.
7 681 
7 682   Deme. I loue thee not, therefore pursue me not,
7 683 Where is Lysander, and faire Hermia?
7 684 The one Ile stay, the other stayeth me.
7 685 Thou toldst me they were stolne into this wood;
7 686 And heere am I, and wood within this wood,
7 687 Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
7 688 Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more
7 689 
7 690    Hel. You draw me, you hard-hearted Adamant,
7 691 But yet you draw not Iron, for my heart
7 692 Is true as steele. Leaue you your power to draw,
7 693 And I shall haue no power to follow you
7 694 
7 695    Deme. Do I entice you? do I speake you faire?
7 696 Or rather doe I not in plainest truth,
7 697 Tell you I doe not, nor I cannot loue you?
7 698   Hel. And euen for that doe I loue thee the more;
7 699 I am your spaniell, and Demetrius,
7 700 The more you beat me, I will fawne on you.
7 701 Vse me but as your spaniell; spurne me, strike me,
7 702 Neglect me, lose me; onely giue me leaue
7 703 (Vnworthy as I am) to follow you.
7 704 What worser place can I beg in your loue,
7 705 (And yet a place of high respect with me)
7 706 Then to be vsed as you doe your dogge
7 707 
7 708    Dem. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,
7 709 For I am sicke when I do looke on thee
7 710 
7 711    Hel. And I am sicke when I looke not on you
7 712 
7 713    Dem. You doe impeach your modesty too much,
7 714 To leaue the Citty, and commit your selfe
7 715 Into the hands of one that loues you not,
7 716 To trust the opportunity of night.
7 717 And the ill counsell of a desert place,
7 718 With the rich worth of your virginity
7 719 
7 720    Hel. Your vertue is my priuiledge: for that
7 721 It is not night when I doe see your face.
7 722 Therefore I thinke I am not in the night,
7 723 Nor doth this wood lacke worlds of company,
7 724 For you in my respect are all the world.
7 725 Then how can it be said I am alone,
7 726 When all the world is heere to looke on me?
7 727   Dem. Ile run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,
7 728 And leaue thee to the mercy of wilde beasts
7 729 
7 730    Hel. The wildest hath not such a heart as you;
7 731 Runne when you will, the story shall be chang'd:
7 732 Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;
7 733 The Doue pursues the Griffin, the milde Hinde
7 734 Makes speed to catch the Tyger. Bootlesse speede,
7 735 When cowardise pursues, and valour flies
7 736 
7 737    Demet. I will not stay thy questions, let me go;
7 738 Or if thou follow me, doe not beleeue,
7 739 But I shall doe thee mischiefe in the wood
7 740 
7 741    Hel. I, in the Temple, in the Towne, and Field
7 742 You doe me mischiefe. Fye Demetrius,
7 743 Your wrongs doe set a scandall on my sexe:
7 744 We cannot fight for loue, as men may doe;
7 745 We should be woo'd, and were not made to wooe.
7 746 I follow thee, and make a heauen of hell,
7 747 To die vpon the hand I loue so well.
7 748 Enter.
7 749 
7 750   Ob. Fare thee well Nymph, ere he do leaue this groue,
7 751 Thou shalt flie him, and he shall seeke thy loue.
7 752 Hast thou the flower there? Welcome wanderer.
7 753 Enter Pucke.
7 754 
7 755   Puck. I there it is
7 756 
7 757    Ob. I pray thee giue it me.
7 758 I know a banke where the wilde time blowes,
7 759 Where Oxslips and the nodding Violet growes,
7 760 Quite ouer-cannoped with luscious woodbine,
7 761 With sweet muske roses, and with Eglantine;
7 762 There sleepes Tytania, sometime of the night,
7 763 Lul'd in these flowers, with dances and delight:
7 764 And there the snake throwes her enammel'd skinne,
7 765 Weed wide enough to rap a Fairy in.
7 766 And with the iuyce of this Ile streake her eyes,
7 767 And make her full of hatefull fantasies.
7 768 Take thou some of it, and seek through this groue;
7 769 A sweet Athenian Lady is in loue
7 770 With a disdainefull youth: annoint his eyes,
7 771 But doe it when the next thing he espies,
7 772 May be the Lady. Thou shalt know the man,
7 773 By the Athenian garments he hath on.
7 774 Effect it with some care, that he may proue
7 775 More fond on her, then she vpon her loue;
7 776 And looke thou meet me ere the first Cocke crow
7 777 
7 778    Pu. Feare not my Lord, your seruant shall do so.
7 779 Enter.
7 780 
7 781 Enter Queene of Fairies, with her traine.
7 782 
7 783   Queen. Come, now a Roundell, and a Fairy song;
7 784 Then for the third part of a minute hence,
7 785 Some to kill Cankers in the muske rose buds,
7 786 Some warre with Reremise, for their leathern wings.
7 787 To make my small Elues coates, and some keepe backe
7 788 The clamorous Owle that nightly hoots and wonders
7 789 At our queint spirits: Sing me now asleepe,
7 790 Then to your offices, and let me rest
7 791 
7 792    Fairies Sing. You spotted Snakes with double tongue,
7 793 Thorny Hedgehogges be not seene,
7 794 Newts and blinde wormes do no wrong,
7 795 Come not neere our Fairy Queene.
7 796 Philomele with melodie,
7 797 Sing in your sweet Lullaby.
7 798 Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby,
7 799 Neuer harme, nor spell, nor charme,
7 800 Come our louely Lady nye,
7 801 So good night with Lullaby
7 802 
7 803    2.Fairy. Weauing Spiders come not heere,
7 804 Hence you long leg'd Spinners, hence:
7 805 Beetles blacke approach not neere;
7 806 Worme nor Snayle doe no offence.
7 807 Philomele with melody, &c
7 808 
7 809    1.Fairy. Hence away, now all is well;
7 810 One aloofe, stand Centinell.
7 811 
7 812 Shee sleepes.
7 813 
7 814 Enter Oberon.
7 815 
7 816   Ober. What thou seest when thou dost wake,
7 817 Do it for thy true Loue take:
7 818 Loue and languish for his sake.
7 819 Be it Ounce, or Catte, or Beare,
7 820 Pard, or Boare with bristled haire,
7 821 In thy eye that shall appeare,
7 822 When thou wak'st, it is thy deare,
7 823 Wake when some vile thing is neere.
7 824 Enter Lisander and Hermia.
7 825 
7 826   Lis. Faire loue, you faint with wandring in y woods,
7 827 And to speake troth I haue forgot our way:
7 828 Wee'll rest vs Hermia, If you thinke it good,
7 829 And tarry for the comfort of the day
7 830 
7 831    Her. Be it so Lysander; finde you out a bed,
7 832 For I vpon this banke will rest my head
7 833 
7 834    Lys. One turfe shall serue as pillow for vs both,
7 835 One heart, one bed, two bosomes, and one troth
7 836 
7 837    Her. Nay good Lysander, for my sake my deere
7 838 Lie further off yet, doe not lie so neere
7 839 
7 840    Lys. O take the sence sweet, of my innocence,
7 841 Loue takes the meaning, in loues conference,
7 842 I meane that my heart vnto yours is knit,
7 843 So that but one heart can you make of it.
7 844 Two bosomes interchanged with an oath,
7 845 So then two bosomes, and a single troth.
7 846 Then by your side, no bed-roome me deny,
7 847 For lying so, Hermia, I doe not lye
7 848 
7 849    Her. Lysander riddles very prettily;
7 850 Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
7 851 If Hermia meant to say, Lysander lied.
7 852 But gentle friend, for loue and courtesie
7 853 Lie further off, in humane modesty,
7 854 Such separation, as may well be said,
7 855 Becomes a vertuous batchelour, and a maide,
7 856 So farre be distant, and good night sweet friend;
7 857 Thy loue nere alter, till thy sweet life end
7 858 
7 859    Lys. Amen, amen, to that faire prayer, say I,
7 860 And then end life, when I end loyalty:
7 861 Heere is my bed, sleepe giue thee all his rest
7 862 
7 863    Her. With halfe that wish, the wishers eyes be prest.
7 864 Enter Pucke. They sleepe.
7 865 
7 866   Puck. Through the Forest haue I gone,
7 867 But Athenian finde I none,
7 868 One whose eyes I might approue
7 869 This flowers force in stirring loue.
7 870 Nigh and silence: who is heere?
7 871 Weedes of Athens he doth weare:
7 872 This is he (my master said)
7 873 Despised the Athenian maide:
7 874 And heere the maiden sleeping sound,
7 875 On the danke and durty ground.
7 876 Pretty soule, she durst not lye
7 877 Neere this lacke-loue, this kill-curtesie.
7 878 Churle, vpon thy eyes I throw
7 879 All the power this charme doth owe:
7 880 When thou wak'st, let loue forbid
7 881 Sleepe his seate on thy eye-lid.
7 882 So awake when I am gone:
7 883 For I must now to Oberon.
7 884 Enter.
7 885 
7 886 Enter Demetrius and Helena running.
7 887 
7 888   Hel. Stay, though thou kill me, sweete Demetrius
7 889 
7 890    De. I charge thee hence, and do not haunt me thus
7 891 
7 892    Hel. O wilt thou darkling leaue me? do not so
7 893 
7 894    De. Stay on thy perill, I alone will goe.
7 895 
7 896 Exit Demetrius.
7 897 
7 898   Hel. O I am out of breath, in this fond chace,
7 899 The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace,
7 900 Happy is Hermia, wheresoere she lies;
7 901 For she hath blessed and attractiue eyes.
7 902 How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt teares.
7 903 If so, my eyes are oftner washt then hers.
7 904 No, no, I am as vgly as a Beare;
7 905 For beasts that meete me, runne away for feare,
7 906 Therefore no maruaile, though Demetrius
7 907 Doe as a monster, flie my presence thus.
7 908 What wicked and dissembling glasse of mine,
7 909 Made me compare with Hermias sphery eyne?
7 910 But who is here? Lysander on the ground;
7 911 Deade or asleepe? I see no bloud, no wound,
7 912 Lysander, if you liue, good sir awake
7 913 
7 914    Lys. And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
7 915 Transparent Helena, nature her shewes art,
7 916 That through thy bosome makes me see thy heart.
7 917 Where is Demetrius? oh how fit a word
7 918 Is that vile name, to perish on my sword!
7 919   Hel. Do not say so Lysander, say not so:
7 920 What though he loue your Hermia? Lord, what though?
7 921 Yet Hermia still loues you; then be content
7 922 
7 923    Lys. Content with Hermia? no, I do repent
7 924 The tedious minutes I with her haue spent.
7 925 Not Hermia, but Helena now I loue;
7 926 Who will not change a Rauen for a Doue?
7 927 The will of man is by his reason sway'd:
7 928 And reason saies you are the worthier Maide.
7 929 Things growing are not ripe vntill their season;
7 930 So I being yong, till now ripe not to reason,
7 931 And touching now the point of humane skill,
7 932 Reason becomes the Marshall to my will.
7 933 And leades me to your eyes, where I orelooke
7 934 Loues stories, written in Loues richest booke
7 935 
7 936    Hel. Wherefore was I to this keene mockery borne?
7 937 When at your hands did I deserue this scorne?
7 938 Ist not enough, ist not enough, yong man,
7 939 That I did neuer, no nor neuer can,
7 940 Deserue a sweete looke from Demetrius eye,
7 941 But you must flout my insufficiency?
7 942 Good troth you do me wrong (good-sooth you do)
7 943 In such disdainfull manner, me to wooe.
7 944 But fare you well; perforce I must confesse,
7 945 I thought you Lord of more true gentlenesse.
7 946 Oh, that a Lady of one man refus'd,
7 947 Should of another therefore be abus'd.
7 948 Enter
7 949 
7 950    Lys. She sees not Hermia: Hermia sleepe thou there,
7 951 And neuer maist thou come Lysander neere;
7 952 For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
7 953 The deepest loathing to the stomacke brings:
7 954 Or as the heresies that men do leaue,
7 955 Are hated most of those that did deceiue:
7 956 So thou, my surfeit, and my heresie,
7 957 Of all be hated; but the most of me;
7 958 And all my powers addresse your loue and might,
7 959 To honour Helen, and to be her Knight.
7 960 Enter.
7 961 
7 962   Her. Helpe me Lysander, helpe me; do thy best
7 963 To plucke this crawling serpent from my brest.
7 964 Aye me, for pitty; what a dreame was here?
7 965 Lysander looke, how I do quake with feare:
7 966 Me-thought a serpent eate my heart away,
7 967 And yet sat smiling at his cruell prey.
7 968 Lysander, What remoou'd? Lysander, Lord,
7 969 What, out of hearing, gone? No sound, no word?
7 970 Alacke where are you? speake and if you heare:
7 971 Speake of all loues; I sound almost with feare.
7 972 No, then I well perceiue you are not nye,
7 973 Either death or you Ile finde immediately.
7 974 Enter.
7 975 
7 976 
7 977 Actus Tertius.
7 978 
7 979 Enter the Clownes.
7 980 
7 981   Bot. Are we all met?
7 982   Quin. Pat, pat, and here's a maruailous conuenient
7 983 place for our rehearsall. This greene plot shall be our
7 984 stage, this hauthorne brake our tyring house, and we will
7 985 do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke
7 986 
7 987    Bot. Peter Quince?
7 988   Peter. What saist thou, bully Bottome?
7 989   Bot. There are things in this Comedy of Piramus and
7 990 Thisby, that will neuer please. First, Piramus must draw a
7 991 sword to kill himselfe; which the Ladies cannot abide.
7 992 How answere you that?
7 993   Snout. Berlaken, a parlous feare
7 994 
7 995    Star. I beleeue we must leaue the killing out, when
7 996 all is done
7 997 
7 998    Bot. Not a whit, I haue a deuice to make all well.
7 999 Write me a Prologue, and let the Prologue seeme to say,
7 1000 we will do no harme with our swords, and that Pyramus
7 1001 is not kill'd indeede: and for the more better assurance,
7 1002 tell them, that I Piramus am not Piramus, but Bottome the
7 1003 Weauer; this will put them out of feare
7 1004 
7 1005    Quin. Well, we will haue such a Prologue, and it shall
7 1006 be written in eight and sixe
7 1007 
7 1008    Bot. No, make it two more, let it be written in eight
7 1009 and eight
7 1010 
7 1011    Snout. Will not the Ladies be afear'd of the Lyon?
7 1012   Star. I feare it, I promise you
7 1013 
7 1014    Bot. Masters, you ought to consider with your selues, to
7 1015 bring in (God shield vs) a Lyon among Ladies, is a most
7 1016 dreadfull thing. For there is not a more fearefull wilde
7 1017 foule then your Lyon liuing: and wee ought to looke
7 1018 to it
7 1019 
7 1020    Snout. Therefore another Prologue must tell he is not
7 1021 a Lyon
7 1022 
7 1023    Bot. Nay, you must name his name, and halfe his face
7 1024 must be seene through the Lyons necke, and he himselfe
7 1025 must speake through, saying thus, or to the same defect;
7 1026 Ladies, or faire Ladies, I would wish you, or I would
7 1027 request you, or I would entreat you, not to feare, not to
7 1028 tremble: my life for yours. If you thinke I come hither
7 1029 as a Lyon, it were pitty of my life. No, I am no such
7 1030 thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let
7 1031 him name his name, and tell him plainly hee is Snug the
7 1032 ioyner
7 1033 
7 1034    Quin. Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard
7 1035 things, that is, to bring the Moone-light into a chamber:
7 1036 for you know Piramus and Thisby meete by Moonelight
7 1037 
7 1038    Sn. Doth the Moone shine that night wee play our
7 1039 play?
7 1040   Bot. A Calender, a Calender, looke in the Almanack,
7 1041 finde out Moone-shine, finde out Moone-shine.
7 1042 Enter Pucke.
7 1043 
7 1044   Quin. Yes, it doth shine that night
7 1045 
7 1046    Bot. Why then may you leaue a casement of the great
7 1047 chamber window (where we play) open, and the Moone
7 1048 may shine in at the casement
7 1049 
7 1050    Quin. I, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
7 1051 and a lanthorne, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present
7 1052 the person of Moone-shine. Then there is another
7 1053 thing, we must haue a wall in the great Chamber; for Piramus
7 1054 and Thisby (saies the story) did talke through the
7 1055 chinke of a wall
7 1056 
7 1057    Sn. You can neuer bring in a wall. What say you
7 1058 Bottome?
7 1059   Bot. Some man or other must present wall, and let
7 1060 him haue some Plaster, or some Lome, or some rough
7 1061 cast about him, to signifie wall; or let him hold his fingers
7 1062 thus; and through that cranny shall Piramus and
7 1063 Thisby whisper
7 1064 
7 1065    Quin. If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit
7 1066 downe euery mothers sonne, and rehearse your parts.
7 1067 Piramus, you begin; when you haue spoken your speech,
7 1068 enter into that Brake, and so euery one according to his
7 1069 cue.
7 1070 Enter Robin.
7 1071 
7 1072   Rob. What hempen home-spuns haue we swaggering
7 1073 here,
7 1074 So neere the Cradle of the Faierie Queene?
7 1075 What, a Play toward? Ile be an auditor,
7 1076 An Actor too perhaps, if I see cause
7 1077 
7 1078    Quin. Speake Piramus: Thisby stand forth
7 1079 
7 1080    Pir. Thisby, the flowers of odious sauors sweete
7 1081 
7 1082    Quin. Odours, odours
7 1083 
7 1084    Pir. Odours sauors sweete,
7 1085 So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby deare.
7 1086 But harke, a voyce: stay thou but here a while,
7 1087 And by and by I will to thee appeare.
7 1088 
7 1089 Exit. Pir.
7 1090 
7 1091   Puck. A stranger Piramus, then ere plaid here
7 1092 
7 1093    This. Must I speake now?
7 1094   Pet. I marry must you. For you must vnderstand he
7 1095 goes but to see a noyse that he heard, and is to come againe
7 1096 
7 1097    Thys. Most radiant Piramus, most Lilly white of hue,
7 1098 Of colour like the red rose on triumphant bryer,
7 1099 Most brisky Iuuenall, and eke most louely Iew,
7 1100 As true as truest horse, that yet would neuer tyre,
7 1101 Ile meete thee Piramus, at Ninnies toombe
7 1102 
7 1103    Pet. Ninus toombe man: why, you must not speake
7 1104 that yet; that you answere to Piramus: you speake all
7 1105 your part at once, cues and all. Piramus enter, your cue is
7 1106 past; it is neuer tyre
7 1107 
7 1108    Thys. O, as true as truest horse, that yet would neuer
7 1109 tyre:
7 1110   Pir. If I were faire, Thisby I were onely thine
7 1111 
7 1112    Pet. O monstrous. O strange. We are hanted; pray
7 1113 masters, flye masters, helpe.
7 1114 
7 1115 The Clownes all Exit.
7 1116 
7 1117   Puk. Ile follow you, Ile leade you about a Round,
7 1118 Through bogge, through bush, through brake, through bryer,
7 1119 Sometime a horse Ile be, sometime a hound:
7 1120 A hogge, a headlesse beare, sometime a fire,
7 1121 And neigh, and barke, and grunt, and rore, and burne,
7 1122 Like horse, hound, hog, beare, fire, at euery turne.
7 1123 Enter.
7 1124 
7 1125 Enter Piramus with the Asse head.
7 1126 
7 1127   Bot. Why do they run away? This is a knauery of
7 1128 them to make me afeard.
7 1129 Enter Snowt
7 1130 
7 1131    Sn. O Bottom, thou art chang'd; What doe I see on
7 1132 thee?
7 1133   Bot. What do you see? You see an Asse-head of your
7 1134 owne, do you?
7 1135 Enter Peter Quince.
7 1136 
7 1137   Pet. Blesse thee Bottome, blesse thee; thou art translated.
7 1138 Enter.
7 1139 
7 1140   Bot. I see their knauery; this is to make an asse of me,
7 1141 to fright me if they could; but I will not stirre from
7 1142 this place, do what they can. I will walke vp and downe
7 1143 here, and I will sing that they shall heare I am not afraid.
7 1144 The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew,
7 1145 With Orenge-tawny bill.
7 1146 The Throstle, with his note so true,
7 1147 The Wren and little quill
7 1148 
7 1149    Tyta. What Angell wakes me from my flowry bed?
7 1150   Bot. The Finch, the Sparrow, and the Larke,
7 1151 The plainsong Cuckow gray;
7 1152 Whose note full many a man doth marke,
7 1153 And dares not answere, nay.
7 1154 For indeede, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?
7 1155 Who would giue a bird the lye, though he cry Cuckow,
7 1156 neuer so?
7 1157   Tyta. I pray thee gentle mortall, sing againe,
7 1158 Mine eare is much enamored of thy note;
7 1159 On the first view to say, to sweare I loue thee.
7 1160 So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.
7 1161 And thy faire vertues force (perforce) doth moue me
7 1162 
7 1163    Bot. Me-thinkes mistresse, you should haue little
7 1164 reason for that: and yet to say the truth, reason and
7 1165 loue keepe little company together, nowadayes.
7 1166 The more the pittie, that some honest neighbours will
7 1167 not make them friends. Nay, I can gleeke vpon occasion
7 1168 
7 1169    Tyta. Thou art as wise, as thou art beautifull
7 1170 
7 1171    Bot. Not so neither: but if I had wit enough to get
7 1172 out of this wood, I haue enough to serue mine owne
7 1173 turne
7 1174 
7 1175    Tyta. Out of this wood, do not desire to goe,
7 1176 Thou shalt remaine here, whether thou wilt or no.
7 1177 I am a spirit of no common rate:
7 1178 The Summer still doth tend vpon my state,
7 1179 And I doe loue thee; therefore goe with me,
7 1180 Ile giue thee Fairies to attend on thee;
7 1181 And they shall fetch thee Iewels from the deepe,
7 1182 And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleepe:
7 1183 And I will purge thy mortall grossenesse so,
7 1184 That thou shalt like an airie spirit go.
7 1185 Enter Pease-blossome, Cobweb, Moth, Mustardseede, and foure
7 1186 Fairies.
7 1187 
7 1188   Fai. Ready; and I, and I, and I, Where shall we go?
7 1189   Tita. Be kinde and curteous to this Gentleman,
7 1190 Hop in his walkes, and gambole in his eies,
7 1191 Feede him with Apricocks, and Dewberries,
7 1192 With purple Grapes, greene Figs, and Mulberries,
7 1193 The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees,
7 1194 And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighes,
7 1195 And light them at the fierie-Glow-wormes eyes,
7 1196 To haue my loue to bed, and to arise:
7 1197 And plucke the wings from painted Butterflies,
7 1198 To fan the Moone-beames from his sleeping eies.
7 1199 Nod to him Elues, and doe him curtesies
7 1200 
7 1201    1.Fai. Haile mortall, haile
7 1202 
7 1203    2.Fai. Haile
7 1204 
7 1205    3.Fai. Haile
7 1206 
7 1207    Bot. I cry your worships mercy hartily; I beseech
7 1208 your worships name
7 1209 
7 1210    Cob. Cobweb
7 1211 
7 1212    Bot. I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good
7 1213 Master Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold
7 1214 with you.
7 1215 Your name honest Gentleman?
7 1216   Pease. Pease Blossome
7 1217 
7 1218    Bot. I pray you commend me to mistresse Squash,
7 1219 your mother, and to master Peascod your father. Good
7 1220 master Pease-blossome, I shal desire of you more acquaintance
7 1221 to. Your name I beseech you sir?
7 1222   Mus. Mustard-seede
7 1223 
7 1224    Peas. Pease-blossome
7 1225 
7 1226    Bot. Good master Mustard seede, I know your patience
7 1227 well: that same cowardly gyant-like Oxe beefe
7 1228 hath deuoured many a gentleman of your house. I promise
7 1229 you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere
7 1230 now. I desire you more acquaintance, good Master
7 1231 Mustard-seede
7 1232 
7 1233    Tita. Come waite vpon him, lead him to my bower.
7 1234 The Moone me-thinks, lookes with a watrie eie,
7 1235 And when she weepes, weepe euerie little flower,
7 1236 Lamenting some enforced chastitie.
7 1237 Tye vp my louers tongue, bring him silently.
7 1238 Enter.
7 1239 
7 1240 Enter King of Pharies, solus.
7 1241 
7 1242   Ob. I wonder if Titania be awak't;
7 1243 Then what it was that next came in her eye,
7 1244 Which she must dote on, in extremitie.
7 1245 Enter Pucke.
7 1246 
7 1247 Here comes my messenger: how now mad spirit,
7 1248 What night-rule now about this haunted groue?
7 1249   Puck. My Mistris with a monster is in loue,
7 1250 Neere to her close and consecrated bower,
7 1251 While she was in her dull and sleeping hower,
7 1252 A crew of patches, rude Mechanicals,
7 1253 That worke for bread vpon Athenian stals,
7 1254 Were met together to rehearse a Play,
7 1255 Intended for great Theseus nuptiall day:
7 1256 The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
7 1257 Who Piramus presented, in their sport,
7 1258 Forsooke his Scene, and entred in a brake,
7 1259 When I did him at this aduantage take,
7 1260 An Asses nole I fixed on his head.
7 1261 Anon his Thisbie must be answered,
7 1262 And forth my Mimmick comes: when they him spie,
7 1263 As Wilde-geese, that the creeping Fowler eye,
7 1264 Or russed-pated choughes, many in sort
7 1265 (Rising and cawing at the guns report)
7 1266 Seuer themselues, and madly sweepe the skye:
7 1267 So at his sight, away his fellowes flye,
7 1268 And at our stampe, here ore and ore one fals;
7 1269 He murther cries, and helpe from Athens cals.
7 1270 Their sense thus weake, lost with their feares thus strong,
7 1271 Made senslesse things begin to do them wrong.
7 1272 For briars and thornes at their apparell snatch,
7 1273 Some sleeues, some hats, from yeelders all things catch,
7 1274 I led them on in this distracted feare,
7 1275 And left sweete Piramus translated there:
7 1276 When in that moment (so it came to passe)
7 1277 Tytania waked, and straightway lou'd an Asse
7 1278 
7 1279    Ob. This fals out better then I could deuise:
7 1280 But hast thou yet lacht the Athenians eyes,
7 1281 With the loue iuyce, as I bid thee doe?
7 1282   Rob. I tooke him sleeping (that is finisht to)
7 1283 And the Athenian woman by his side,
7 1284 That when he wak't, of force she must be eyde.
7 1285 Enter Demetrius and Hermia.
7 1286 
7 1287   Ob. Stand close, this is the same Athenian
7 1288 
7 1289    Rob. This is the woman, but not this the man
7 1290 
7 1291    Dem. O why rebuke you him that loues you so?
7 1292 Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
7 1293 
7 1294    Her. Now I but chide, but I should vse thee worse.
7 1295 For thou (I feare) hast giuen me cause to curse,
7 1296 If thou hast slaine Lysander in his sleepe,
7 1297 Being oreshooes in bloud, plunge in the deepe, and kill
7 1298 me too:
7 1299 The Sunne was not so true vnto the day,
7 1300 As he to me. Would he haue stollen away,
7 1301 From sleeping Hermia? Ile beleeue as soone
7 1302 This whole earth may be bord, and that the Moone
7 1303 May through the Center creepe, and so displease
7 1304 Her brothers noonetide, with th'Antipodes.
7 1305 It cannot be but thou hast murdred him,
7 1306 So should a murtherer looke, so dead, so grim
7 1307 
7 1308    Dem. So should the murderer looke, and so should I,
7 1309 Pierst through the heart with your stearne cruelty:
7 1310 Yet you the murderer lookes as bright as cleare,
7 1311 As yonder Venus in her glimmering spheare
7 1312 
7 1313    Her. What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
7 1314 Ah good Demetrius, wilt thou giue him me?
7 1315   Dem. I'de rather giue his carkasse to my hounds
7 1316 
7 1317    Her. Out dog, out cur, thou driu'st me past the bounds
7 1318 Of maidens patience. Hast thou slaine him then?
7 1319 Henceforth be neuer numbred among men.
7 1320 Oh, once tell true, euen for my sake,
7 1321 Durst thou a lookt vpon him, being awake?
7 1322 And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O braue tutch:
7 1323 Could not a worme, an Adder do so much?
7 1324 An Adder did it: for with doubler tongue
7 1325 Then thine (thou serpent) neuer Adder stung
7 1326 
7 1327    Dem. You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood,
7 1328 I am not guiltie of Lysanders blood:
7 1329 Nor is he dead for ought that I can tell
7 1330 
7 1331    Her. I pray thee tell me then that he is well
7 1332 
7 1333    Dem. And if I could, what should I get therefore?
7 1334   Her. A priuiledge, neuer to see me more;
7 1335 And from thy hated presence part I: see me no more
7 1336 Whether he be dead or no.
7 1337 Enter.
7 1338 
7 1339   Dem. There is no following her in this fierce vaine,
7 1340 Here therefore for a while I will remaine.
7 1341 So sorrowes heauinesse doth heauier grow:
7 1342 For debt that bankrout slip doth sorrow owe,
7 1343 Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
7 1344 If for his tender here I make some stay.
7 1345 
7 1346 Lie downe.
7 1347 
7 1348   Ob. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite
7 1349 And laid the loue iuyce on some true loues sight:
7 1350 Of thy misprision, must perforce ensue
7 1351 Some true loue turn'd, and not a false turn'd true
7 1352 
7 1353    Rob. Then fate ore-rules, that one man holding troth,
7 1354 A million faile, confounding oath on oath
7 1355 
7 1356    Ob. About the wood, goe swifter then the winde,
7 1357 And Helena of Athens looke thou finde.
7 1358 All fancy sicke she is, and pale of cheere,
7 1359 With sighes of loue, that costs the fresh bloud deare.
7 1360 By some illusion see thou bring her heere,
7 1361 Ile charme his eyes against she doth appeare
7 1362 
7 1363    Robin. I go, I go, looke how I goe,
7 1364 Swifter then arrow from the Tartars bowe.
7 1365 Enter.
7 1366 
7 1367   Ob. Flower of this purple die,
7 1368 Hit with Cupids archery,
7 1369 Sinke in apple of his eye,
7 1370 When his loue he doth espie,
7 1371 Let her shine as gloriously
7 1372 As the Venus of the sky.
7 1373 When thou wak'st if she be by,
7 1374 Beg of her for remedy.
7 1375 Enter Pucke.
7 1376 
7 1377   Puck. Captaine of our Fairy band,
7 1378 Helena is heere at hand,
7 1379 And the youth, mistooke by me,
7 1380 Pleading for a Louers fee.
7 1381 Shall we their fond Pageant see?
7 1382 Lord, what fooles these mortals be!
7 1383   Ob. Stand aside: the noyse they make,
7 1384 Will cause Demetrius to awake
7 1385 
7 1386    Puck. Then will two at once wooe one,
7 1387 That must needs be sport alone:
7 1388 And those things doe best please me,
7 1389 That befall preposterously.
7 1390 Enter Lysander and Helena.
7 1391 
7 1392   Lys. Why should you think y I should wooe in scorn?
7 1393 Scorne and derision neuer comes in teares:
7 1394 Looke when I vow I weepe; and vowes so borne,
7 1395 In their natiuity all truth appeares.
7 1396 How can these things in me, seeme scorne to you?
7 1397 Bearing the badge of faith to proue them true
7 1398 
7 1399    Hel. You doe aduance your cunning more & more,
7 1400 When truth kils truth, O diuelish holy fray!
7 1401 These vowes are Hermias. Will you giue her ore?
7 1402 Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.
7 1403 Your vowes to her, and me, (put in two scales)
7 1404 Will euen weigh, and both as light as tales
7 1405 
7 1406    Lys. I had no iudgement, when to her I swore
7 1407 
7 1408    Hel. Nor none in my minde, now you giue her ore
7 1409 
7 1410    Lys. Demetrius loues her, and he loues not you.
7 1411 
7 1412 Awa.
7 1413 
7 1414   Dem. O Helen, goddesse, nimph, perfect, diuine,
7 1415 To what, my loue, shall I compare thine eyne!
7 1416 Christall is muddy, O how ripe in show,
7 1417 Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
7 1418 That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
7 1419 Fan'd with the Easterne winde, turnes to a crow,
7 1420 When thou holdst vp thy hand. O let me kisse
7 1421 This Princesse of pure white, this seale of blisse
7 1422 
7 1423    Hell. O spight! O hell! I see you are all bent
7 1424 To set against me, for your merriment:
7 1425 If you were ciuill, and knew curtesie,
7 1426 You would not doe me thus much iniury.
7 1427 Can you not hate me, as I know you doe,
7 1428 But you must ioyne in soules to mocke me to?
7 1429 If you are men, as men you are in show,
7 1430 You would not vse a gentle Lady so;
7 1431 To vow, and sweare, and superpraise my parts,
7 1432 When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
7 1433 You both are Riuals, and loue Hermia;
7 1434 And now both Riuals to mocke Helena.
7 1435 A trim exploit, a manly enterprize,
7 1436 To coniure teares vp in a poore maids eyes,
7 1437 With your derision; none of noble sort,
7 1438 Would so offend a Virgin, and extort
7 1439 A poore soules patience, all to make you sport,
7 1440   Lysa. You are vnkind Demetrius; be not so,
7 1441 For you loue Hermia; this you know I know;
7 1442 And here with all good will, with all my heart,
7 1443 In Hermias loue I yeeld you vp my part;
7 1444 And yours of Helena, To me bequeath,
7 1445 Whom I do loue, and will do to my death
7 1446 
7 1447    Hel. Neuer did mockers wast more idle breth
7 1448 
7 1449    Dem. Lysander, keep thy Hermia, I will none:
7 1450 If ere I lou'd her, all that loue is gone.
7 1451 My heart to her, but as guest-wise soiourn'd,
7 1452 And now to Helen it is home return'd,
7 1453 There to remaine
7 1454 
7 1455    Lys. It is not so
7 1456 
7 1457    De. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
7 1458 Lest to thy perill thou abide it deare.
7 1459 Looke where thy Loue comes, yonder is thy deare.
7 1460 Enter Hermia.
7 1461 
7 1462   Her. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
7 1463 The eare more quicke of apprehension makes,
7 1464 Wherein it doth impaire the seeing sense,
7 1465 It paies the hearing double recompence.
7 1466 Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander found,
7 1467 Mine eare (I thanke it) brought me to that sound.
7 1468 But why vnkindly didst thou leaue me so?
7 1469   Lysan. Why should hee stay whom Loue doth presse to go?
7 1470   Her. What loue could presse Lysander from my side?
7 1471   Lys. Lysanders loue (that would not let him bide)
7 1472 Faire Helena; who more engilds the night,
7 1473 Then all yon fierie oes, and eies of light.
7 1474 Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know,
7 1475 The hate I bare thee, made me leaue thee so?
7 1476   Her. You speake not as you thinke; it cannot be
7 1477 
7 1478    Hel. Loe, she is one of this confederacy,
7 1479 Now I perceiue they haue conioyn'd all three,
7 1480 To fashion this false sport in spight of me.
7 1481 Iniurous Hermia, most vngratefull maid,
7 1482 Haue you conspir'd, haue you with these contriu'd
7 1483 To baite me, with this foule derision?
7 1484 Is all the counsell that we two haue shar'd,
7 1485 The sisters vowes, the houres that we haue spent,
7 1486 When wee haue chid the hasty footed time,
7 1487 For parting vs; O, is all forgot?
7 1488 All schooledaies friendship, child-hood innocence?
7 1489 We Hermia, like two Artificiall gods,
7 1490 Haue with our needles, created both one flower,
7 1491 Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
7 1492 Both warbling of one song, both in one key:
7 1493 As if our hands, our sides, voices, and mindes
7 1494 Had beene incorporate. So we grew together,
7 1495 Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
7 1496 But yet a vnion in partition,
7 1497 Two louely berries molded on one stem,
7 1498 So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,
7 1499 Two of the first life coats in Heraldry,
7 1500 Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
7 1501 And will you rent our ancient loue asunder,
7 1502 To ioyne with men in scorning your poore friend?
7 1503 It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly.
7 1504 Our sexe as well as I, may chide you for it,
7 1505 Though I alone doe feele the iniurie
7 1506 
7 1507    Her. I am amazed at your passionate words,
7 1508 I scorne you not; It seemes that you scorne me
7 1509 
7 1510    Hel. Haue you not set Lysander, as in scorne
7 1511 To follow me, and praise my eies and face?
7 1512 And made your other loue, Demetrius
7 1513 (Who euen but now did spurne me with his foote)
7 1514 To call me goddesse, nimph, diuine, and rare,
7 1515 Precious, celestiall? Wherefore speakes he this
7 1516 To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
7 1517 Denie your loue (so rich within his soule)
7 1518 And tender me (forsooth) affection,
7 1519 But by your setting on, by your consent?
7 1520 What though I be not so in grace as you,
7 1521 So hung vpon with loue, so fortunate?
7 1522 (But miserable most, to loue vnlou'd)
7 1523 This you should pittie, rather then despise
7 1524 
7 1525    Her. I vnderstand not what you meane by this
7 1526 
7 1527    Hel. I, doe, perseuer, counterfeit sad lookes,
7 1528 Make mouthes vpon me when I turne my backe,
7 1529 Winke each at other, hold the sweete iest vp:
7 1530 This sport well carried, shall be chronicled.
7 1531 If you haue any pittie, grace, or manners,
7 1532 You would not make me such an argument:
7 1533 But fare ye well, 'tis partly mine owne fault,
7 1534 Which death or absence soone shall remedie
7 1535 
7 1536    Lys. Stay gentle Helena, heare my excuse,
7 1537 My loue, my life, my soule, faire Helena
7 1538 
7 1539    Hel. O excellent!
7 1540   Her. Sweete, do not scorne her so
7 1541 
7 1542    Dem. If she cannot entreate, I can compell
7 1543 
7 1544    Lys. Thou canst compell, no more then she entreate.
7 1545 Thy threats haue no more strength then her weak praise.
7 1546 Helen, I loue thee, by my life I doe;
7 1547 I sweare by that which I will lose for thee,
7 1548 To proue him false, that saies I loue thee not
7 1549 
7 1550    Dem. I say, I loue thee more then he can do
7 1551 
7 1552    Lys. If thou say so, withdraw and proue it too
7 1553 
7 1554    Dem. Quick, come
7 1555 
7 1556    Her. Lysander, whereto tends all this?
7 1557   Lys. Away, you Ethiope
7 1558 
7 1559    Dem. No, no, Sir, seeme to breake loose;
7 1560 Take on as you would follow,
7 1561 But yet come not: you are a tame man, go
7 1562 
7 1563    Lys. Hang off thou cat, thou bur; vile thing let loose,
7 1564 Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent
7 1565 
7 1566    Her. Why are you growne so rude?
7 1567 What change is this sweete Loue?
7 1568   Lys. Thy loue? out tawny Tartar, out;
7 1569 Out loathed medicine; O hated poison hence
7 1570 
7 1571    Her. Do you not iest?
7 1572   Hel. Yes sooth, and so do you
7 1573 
7 1574    Lys. Demetrius: I will keepe my word with thee
7 1575 
7 1576    Dem. I would I had your bond: for I perceiue
7 1577 A weake bond holds you; Ile not trust your word
7 1578 
7 1579    Lys. What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
7 1580 Although I hate her, Ile not harme her so
7 1581 
7 1582    Her. What, can you do me greater harme then hate?
7 1583 Hate me, wherefore? O me, what newes my Loue?
7 1584 Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
7 1585 I am as faire now, as I was ere while.
7 1586 Since night you lou'd me: yet since night you left me.
7 1587 Why then you left me (O the gods forbid)
7 1588 In earnest, shall I say?
7 1589   Lys. I, by my life;
7 1590 And neuer did desire to see thee more.
7 1591 Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
7 1592 Be certaine, nothing truer: 'tis no iest,
7 1593 That I do hate thee, and loue Helena
7 1594 
7 1595    Her. O me, you iugler, you canker blossome,
7 1596 You theefe of loue; What, haue you come by night,
7 1597 And stolne my loues heart from him?
7 1598   Hel. Fine yfaith:
7 1599 Haue you no modesty, no maiden shame,
7 1600 No touch of bashfulnesse? What, will you teare
7 1601 Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
7 1602 Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you
7 1603 
7 1604    Her. Puppet? why so? I, that way goes the game.
7 1605 Now I perceiue that she hath made compare
7 1606 Betweene our statures, she hath vrg'd her height,
7 1607 And with her personage, her tall personage,
7 1608 Her height (forsooth) she hath preuail'd with him.
7 1609 And are you growne so high in his esteeme,
7 1610 Because I am so dwarfish, and so low?
7 1611 How low am I, thou painted May-pole? Speake,
7 1612 How low am I? I am not yet so low,
7 1613 But that my nailes can reach vnto thine eyes
7 1614 
7 1615    Hel. I pray you though you mocke me, gentlemen,
7 1616 Let her not hurt me; I was neuer curst:
7 1617 I haue no gift at all in shrewishnesse;
7 1618 I am a right maide for my cowardize;
7 1619 Let her not strike me: you perhaps may thinke,
7 1620 Because she is something lower then my selfe,
7 1621 That I can match her
7 1622 
7 1623    Her. Lower? harke againe
7 1624 
7 1625    Hel. Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me,
7 1626 I euermore did loue you Hermia,
7 1627 Did euer keepe your counsels, neuer wronged you,
7 1628 Saue that in loue vnto Demetrius,
7 1629 I told him of your stealth vnto this wood.
7 1630 He followed you, for loue I followed him,
7 1631 But he hath chid me hence, and threatned me
7 1632 To strike me, spurne me, nay to kill me too;
7 1633 And now, so you will let me quiet go,
7 1634 To Athens will I beare my folly backe,
7 1635 And follow you no further. Let me go.
7 1636 You see how simple, and how fond I am
7 1637 
7 1638    Her. Why get you gone: who ist that hinders you?
7 1639   Hel. A foolish heart, that I leaue here behinde
7 1640 
7 1641    Her. What, with Lysander?
7 1642   Her. With Demetrius
7 1643 
7 1644    Lys. Be not afraid, she shall not harme thee Helena
7 1645 
7 1646    Dem. No sir, she shall not, though you take her part
7 1647 
7 1648    Hel. O when she's angry, she is keene and shrewd,
7 1649 She was a vixen when she went to schoole,
7 1650 And though she be but little, she is fierce
7 1651 
7 1652    Her. Little againe? Nothing but low and little?
7 1653 Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
7 1654 Let me come to her
7 1655 
7 1656    Lys. Get you gone you dwarfe,
7 1657 You minimus, of hindring knot-grasse made,
7 1658 You bead, you acorne
7 1659 
7 1660    Dem. You are too officious,
7 1661 In her behalfe that scornes your seruices.
7 1662 Let her alone, speake not of Helena,
7 1663 Take not her part. For if thou dost intend
7 1664 Neuer so little shew of loue to her,
7 1665 Thou shalt abide it
7 1666 
7 1667    Lys. Now she holds me not,
7 1668 Now follow if thou dar'st, to try whose right,
7 1669 Of thine or mine is most in Helena
7 1670 
7 1671    Dem. Follow? Nay, Ile goe with thee cheeke by
7 1672 iowle.
7 1673 
7 1674 Exit Lysander and Demetrius.
7 1675 
7 1676   Her. You Mistris, all this coyle is long of you.
7 1677 Nay, goe not backe
7 1678 
7 1679    Hel. I will not trust you I,
7 1680 Nor longer stay in your curst companie.
7 1681 Your hands then mine, are quicker for a fray,
7 1682 My legs are longer though to runne away.
7 1683 Enter Oberon and Pucke.
7 1684 
7 1685   Ob. This is thy negligence, still thou mistak'st,
7 1686 Or else committ'st thy knaueries willingly
7 1687 
7 1688    Puck. Beleeue me, King of shadowes, I mistooke,
7 1689 Did not you tell me, I should know the man,
7 1690 By the Athenian garments he hath on?
7 1691 And so farre blamelesse proues my enterprize,
7 1692 That I haue nointed an Athenians eies,
7 1693 And so farre am I glad, it so did sort,
7 1694 As this their iangling I esteeme a sport
7 1695 
7 1696    Ob. Thou seest these Louers seeke a place to fight,
7 1697 Hie therefore Robin, ouercast the night,
7 1698 The starrie Welkin couer thou anon,
7 1699 With drooping fogge as blacke as Acheron,
7 1700 And lead these testie Riuals so astray,
7 1701 As one come not within anothers way.
7 1702 Like to Lysander, sometime frame thy tongue,
7 1703 Then stirre Demetrius vp with bitter wrong;
7 1704 And sometime raile thou like Demetrius;
7 1705 And from each other looke thou leade them thus,
7 1706 Till ore their browes, death-counterfeiting, sleepe
7 1707 With leaden legs, and Battie-wings doth creepe:
7 1708 Then crush this hearbe into Lysanders eie,
7 1709 Whose liquor hath this vertuous propertie,
7 1710 To take from thence all error, with his might,
7 1711 and make his eie-bals role with wonted sight.
7 1712 When they next wake, all this derision
7 1713 Shall seeme a dreame, and fruitless vision,
7 1714 And backe to Athens shall the Louers wend
7 1715 With league, whose date till death shall neuer end.
7 1716 Whiles I in this affaire do thee imploy,
7 1717 Ile to my Queene, and beg her Indian Boy;
7 1718 And then I will her charmed eie release
7 1719 From monsters view, and all things shall be peace
7 1720 
7 1721    Puck. My Fairie Lord, this must be done with haste,
7 1722 For night-swift Dragons cut the Clouds full fast,
7 1723 And yonder shines Auroras harbinger;
7 1724 At whose approach Ghosts wandring here and there,
7 1725 Troope home to Church-yards; damned spirits all,
7 1726 That in crosse-waies and flouds haue buriall,
7 1727 Alreadie to their wormie beds are gone;
7 1728 For feare least day should looke their shames vpon,
7 1729 They wilfully themselues exile from light,
7 1730 And must for aye consort with blacke browd night
7 1731 
7 1732    Ob. But we are spirits of another sort:
7 1733 I, with the mornings loue haue oft made sport,
7 1734 And like a Forrester, the groues may tread,
7 1735 Euen till the Easterne gate all fierie red,
7 1736 Opening on Neptune, With faire blessed beames,
7 1737 Turnes into yellow gold, his salt greene streames.
7 1738 But not withstanding haste, make no delay:
7 1739 We may effect this businesse, yet ere day
7 1740 
7 1741    Puck. Vp and downe, vp and downe, I will leade
7 1742 them vp and downe: I am fear'd in field and towne.
7 1743 Goblin, lead them vp and downe: here comes one.
7 1744 Enter Lysander.
7 1745 
7 1746   Lys. Where art thou, proud Demetrius?
7 1747 Speake thou now
7 1748 
7 1749    Rob. Here villaine, drawne & readie. Where art thou?
7 1750   Lys. I will be with thee straight
7 1751 
7 1752    Rob. Follow me then to plainer ground.
7 1753 Enter Demetrius.
7 1754 
7 1755   Dem. Lysander, speake againe;
7 1756 Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
7 1757 Speake in some bush: Where dost thou hide thy head?
7 1758   Rob. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
7 1759 Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
7 1760 And wilt not come? Come recreant, come thou childe,
7 1761 Ile whip thee with a rod. He is defil'd
7 1762 That drawes a sword on thee
7 1763 
7 1764    Dem. Yea, art thou there?
7 1765   Ro. Follow my voice, we'l try no manhood here.
7 1766 Enter.
7 1767 
7 1768   Lys. He goes before me, and still dares me on,
7 1769 When I come where he cals, then he's gone.
7 1770 The Villaine is much lighter heel'd then I:
7 1771 I followed fast, but faster he did flye;
7 1772 
7 1773 shifting places.
7 1774 
7 1775 That fallen am I in darke vneuen way,
7 1776 And here wil rest me. Come thou gentle day:
7 1777 
7 1778 lye down.
7 1779 
7 1780 For if but once thou shew me thy gray light,
7 1781 Ile finde Demetrius, and reuenge this spight.
7 1782 Enter Robin and Demetrius.
7 1783 
7 1784   Rob. Ho, ho, ho; coward, why com'st thou not?
7 1785   Dem. Abide me, if thou dar'st. For well I wot,
7 1786 Thou runst before me, shifting euery place,
7 1787 And dar'st not stand, nor looke me in the face.
7 1788 Where art thou?
7 1789   Rob. Come hither, I am here
7 1790 
7 1791    Dem. Nay then thou mock'st me; thou shalt buy this
7 1792 deere,
7 1793 If euer I thy face by day-light see.
7 1794 Now goe thy way: faintnesse constraineth me,
7 1795 To measure out my length on this cold bed,
7 1796 By daies approach looke to be visited.
7 1797 Enter Helena.
7 1798 
7 1799   Hel. O weary night, O long and tedious night,
7 1800 Abate thy houres, shine comforts from the East,
7 1801 That I may backe to Athens by day-light,
7 1802 From these that my poore companie detest;
7 1803 And sleepe that sometime shuts vp sorrowes eie,
7 1804 Steale me a while from mine owne companie.
7 1805 
7 1806 Sleepe.
7 1807 
7 1808   Rob. Yet but three? Come one more,
7 1809 Two of both kindes makes vp foure.
7 1810 Here she comes, curst and sad,
7 1811 Cupid is a knauish lad,
7 1812 Enter Hermia.
7 1813 
7 1814 Thus to make poore females mad
7 1815 
7 1816    Her. Neuer so wearie, neuer so in woe,
7 1817 Bedabbled with the dew, and torne with briars,
7 1818 I can no further crawle, no further goe;
7 1819 My legs can keepe no pace with my desires.
7 1820 Here will I rest me till the breake of day,
7 1821 Heauens shield Lysander, if they meane a fray
7 1822 
7 1823    Rob. On the ground sleepe sound,
7 1824 Ile apply your eie gentle louer, remedy.
7 1825 When thou wak'st, thou tak'st
7 1826 True delight in the sight of thy former Ladies eye,
7 1827 And the Country Prouerb knowne,
7 1828 That euery man should take his owne,
7 1829 In your waking shall be showne.
7 1830 Iacke shall haue Iill, nought shall goe ill.
7 1831 The man shall haue his Mare againe, and all shall bee
7 1832 well.
7 1833 
7 1834 They sleepe all the Act.
7 1835 
7 1836 
7 1837 Actus Quartus.
7 1838 
7 1839 Enter Queene of Fairies, and Clowne, and Fairies, and the King
7 1840 behinde
7 1841 them.
7 1842 
7 1843   Tita. Come, sit thee downe vpon this flowry bed,
7 1844 While I thy amiable cheekes doe coy,
7 1845 And sticke muske roses in thy sleeke smoothe head,
7 1846 And kisse thy faire large eares, my gentle ioy
7 1847 
7 1848    Clow. Where's Peaseblossome?

7 1850 
7 1851    Clow. Scratch my head, Pease-blossome. Wher's Mounsieuer
7 1852 Cobweb
7 1853 
7 1854    Cob. Ready
7 1855 
7 1856    Clowne. Mounsieur Cobweb, good Mounsier get your
7 1857 weapons in your hand, & kill me a red hipt humble-Bee,
7 1858 on the top of a thistle; and good Mounsieur bring mee
7 1859 the hony bag. Doe not fret your selfe too much in the
7 1860 action, Mounsieur; and good mounsieur haue a care the
7 1861 hony bag breake not, I would be loth to haue you ouerflowne
7 1862 with a hony-bag signiour. Where's Mounsieur

7 1867 Pray you leaue your courtesie good Mounsieur
7 1868 
7 1869    Mus. What's your will?
7 1870   Clo. Nothing good Mounsieur, but to help Caualery
7 1871 Cobweb to scratch. I must to the Barbers Mounsieur, for
7 1872 me-thinkes I am maruellous hairy about the face. And I
7 1873 am such a tender asse, if my haire do but tickle me, I must
7 1874 scratch
7 1875 
7 1876    Tita. What, wilt thou heare some musicke, my sweet
7 1877 loue
7 1878 
7 1879    Clow. I haue a reasonable good eare in musicke. Let
7 1880 vs haue the tongs and the bones.
7 1881 
7 1882 Musicke Tongs, Rurall Musicke.
7 1883 
7 1884   Tita. Or say sweete Loue, what thou desirest to eat
7 1885 
7 1886    Clowne. Truly a pecke of Prouender; I could munch
7 1887 your good dry Oates. Me-thinkes I haue a great desire
7 1888 to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweete hay hath no fellow
7 1889 
7 1890    Tita. I haue a venturous Fairy,
7 1891 That shall seeke the Squirrels hoard,
7 1892 And fetch thee new Nuts
7 1893 
7 1894    Clown. I had rather haue a handfull or two of dried
7 1895 pease. But I pray you let none of your people stirre me, I
7 1896 haue an exposition of sleepe come vpon me
7 1897 
7 1898    Tyta. Sleepe thou, and I will winde thee in my arms,
7 1899 Fairies be gone, and be alwaies away.
7 1900 So doth the woodbine, the sweet Honisuckle,
7 1901 Gently entwist; the female Iuy so
7 1902 Enrings the barky fingers of the Elme.
7 1903 O how I loue thee! how I dote on thee!
7 1904 Enter Robin goodfellow and Oberon.
7 1905 
7 1906   Ob. Welcome good Robin:
7 1907 Seest thou this sweet sight?
7 1908 Her dotage now I doe begin to pitty.
7 1909 For meeting her of late behinde the wood,
7 1910 Seeking sweet sauours for this hatefull foole,
7 1911 I did vpbraid her, and fall out with her.
7 1912 For she his hairy temples then had rounded,
7 1913 With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers.
7 1914 And that same dew which somtime on the buds,
7 1915 Was wont to swell like round and orient pearles;
7 1916 Stood now within the pretty flouriets eyes,
7 1917 Like teares that did their owne disgrace bewaile.
7 1918 When I had at my pleasure taunted her,
7 1919 And she in milde termes beg'd my patience,
7 1920 I then did aske of her, her changeling childe,
7 1921 Which straight she gaue me, and her fairy sent
7 1922 To beare him to my Bower in Fairy Land.
7 1923 And now I haue the Boy, I will vndoe
7 1924 This hatefull imperfection of her eyes.
7 1925 And gentle Pucke, take this transformed scalpe,
7 1926 From off the head of this Athenian swaine;
7 1927 That he awaking when the other doe,
7 1928 May all to Athens backe againe repaire,
7 1929 And thinke no more of this nights accidents,
7 1930 But as the fierce vexation of dreame.
7 1931 But first I will release the Fairy Queene.
7 1932 Be thou as thou wast wont to be;
7 1933 See as thou wast wont to see.
7 1934 Dians bud, or Cupids flower,
7 1935 Hath such force and blessed power.
7 1936 Now my Titania wake you my sweet Queene
7 1937 
7 1938    Tita. My Oberon, what visions haue I seene!
7 1939 Me-thought I was enamoured of an asse
7 1940 
7 1941    Ob. There lies your loue
7 1942 
7 1943    Tita. How came these things to passe?
7 1944 Oh, how mine eyes doth loath this visage now!
7 1945   Ob. Silence a while. Robin take off his head:
7 1946 Titania, musick call, and strike more dead
7 1947 Then common sleepe; of all these, fine the sense
7 1948 
7 1949    Tita. Musicke, ho musicke, such as charmeth sleepe.
7 1950 
7 1951 Musick still.
7 1952 
7 1953   Rob. When thou wak'st, with thine owne fooles eies
7 1954 peepe
7 1955 
7 1956    Ob. Sound musick; come my Queen, take hands with me
7 1957 And rocke the ground whereon these sleepers be.
7 1958 Now thou and I new in amity,
7 1959 And will to morrow midnight, solemnly
7 1960 Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly,
7 1961 And blesse it to all faire posterity.
7 1962 There shall the paires of faithfull Louers be
7 1963 Wedded, with Theseus, all in iollity
7 1964 
7 1965    Rob. Faire King attend, and marke,
7 1966 I doe heare the morning Larke,
7 1967   Ob. Then my Queene in silence sad,
7 1968 Trip we after the nights shade;
7 1969 We the Globe can compasse soone,
7 1970 Swifter then the wandering Moone
7 1971 
7 1972    Tita. Come my Lord, and in our flight,
7 1973 Tell me how it came this night,
7 1974 That I sleeping heere was found,
7 1975 
7 1976 Sleepers Lye still.
7 1977 
7 1978 With these mortals on the ground.
7 1979 
7 1980 Exeunt.
7 1981 
7 1982 Winde Hornes.
7 1983 
7 1984 Enter Theseus, Egeus, Hippolita and all his traine.
7 1985 
7 1986   Thes. Goe one of you, finde out the Forrester,
7 1987 For now our obseruation is perform'd;
7 1988 And since we haue the vaward of the day,
7 1989 My Loue shall heare the musicke of my hounds.
7 1990 Vncouple in the Westerne valley, let them goe;
7 1991 Dispatch I say, and finde the Forrester.
7 1992 We will faire Queene, vp to the Mountains top,
7 1993 And marke the musicall confusion
7 1994 Of hounds and eccho in coniunction
7 1995 
7 1996    Hip. I was with Hercules and Cadmus once.
7 1997 When in a wood of Creete they bayed the Beare
7 1998 With hounds of Sparta; neuer did I heare
7 1999 Such gallant chiding. For besides the groues,
7 2000 The skies, the fountaines, euery region neere,
7 2001 Seeme all one mutuall cry. I neuer heard
7 2002 So musicall a discord, such sweet thunder
7 2003 
7 2004    Thes. My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kinde,
7 2005 So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
7 2006 With eares that sweepe away the morning dew,
7 2007 Crooke kneed, and dew-lapt, like Thessalian Buls,
7 2008 Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bels,
7 2009 Each vnder each. A cry more tuneable
7 2010 Was neuer hallowed to, nor cheer'd with horne,
7 2011 In Creete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly;
7 2012 Iudge when you heare. But soft, what nimphs are these?
7 2013   Egeus. My Lord, this is my daughter heere asleepe,
7 2014 And this Lysander, this Demetrius is,
7 2015 This Helena, olde Nedars Helena,
7 2016 I wonder of this being heere together
7 2017 
7 2018    The. No doubt they rose vp early, to obserue
7 2019 The right of May; and hearing our intent,
7 2020 Came heere in grace of our solemnity.
7 2021 But speake Egeus, is not this the day
7 2022 That Hermia should giue answer of her choice?
7 2023   Egeus. It is, my Lord
7 2024 
7 2025    Thes. Goe bid the hunts-men wake them with their
7 2026 hornes.
7 2027 
7 2028 Hornes and they wake.
7 2029 
7 2030 Shout within, they all start vp.
7 2031 
7 2032   Thes. Good morrow friends: Saint Valentine is past,
7 2033 Begin these wood birds but to couple now?
7 2034   Lys. Pardon my Lord
7 2035 
7 2036    Thes. I pray you all stand vp.
7 2037 I know you two are Riuall enemies.
7 2038 How comes this gentle concord in the world,
7 2039 That hatred is so farre from iealousie,
7 2040 To sleepe by hate, and feare no enmity
7 2041 
7 2042    Lys. My Lord, I shall reply amazedly,
7 2043 Halfe sleepe, halfe waking. but as yet, I sweare,
7 2044 I cannot truly say how I came heere.
7 2045 But as I thinke (for truly would I speake)
7 2046 And now I doe bethinke me, so it is;
7 2047 I came with Hermia hither. Our intent
7 2048 Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be
7 2049 Without the perill of the Athenian Law
7 2050 
7 2051    Ege. Enough, enough, my Lord: you haue enough;
7 2052 I beg the Law, the Law, vpon his head:
7 2053 They would have stolne away, they would Demetrius,
7 2054 Thereby to haue defeated you and me:
7 2055 You of your wife, and me of my consent;
7 2056 Of my consent, that she should be your wife
7 2057 
7 2058    Dem. My Lord, faire Helen told me of their stealth,
7 2059 Of this their purpose hither, to this wood,
7 2060 And I in furie hither followed them;
7 2061 Faire Helena, in fancy followed me.
7 2062 But my good Lord, I wot not by what not by what power,
7 2063 (But by some power it is) my loue
7 2064 To Hermia (melted as the snow)
7 2065 Seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude,
7 2066 Which in my childehood I did doat vpon:
7 2067 And all the faith, the vertue of my heart,
7 2068 The obiect and the pleasure of mine eye,
7 2069 Is onely Helena. To her, my Lord,
7 2070 Was I betroth'd, ere I see Hermia,
7 2071 But like a sickenesse did I loath this food,
7 2072 But as in health, come to my naturall taste,
7 2073 Now doe I wish it, loue it, long for it,
7 2074 And will for euermore be true to it
7 2075 
7 2076    Thes. Faire Louers, you are fortunately met;
7 2077 Of this discourse we shall heare more anon.
7 2078 Egeus, I will ouer-beare your will;
7 2079 For in the Temple, by and by with vs,
7 2080 These couples shall eternally be knit.
7 2081 And for the morning now is something worne,
7 2082 Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.
7 2083 Away, with vs to Athens; three and three,
7 2084 Wee'll hold a feast in great solemnitie.
7 2085 Come Hippolita.
7 2086 
7 2087 Exit Duke and Lords.
7 2088 
7 2089   Dem. These things seeme small & vndistinguishable,
7 2090 Like farre off mountaines turned into Clouds
7 2091 
7 2092    Her. Me-thinks I see these things with parted eye,
7 2093 When euery thing seemes double
7 2094 
7 2095    Hel. So me-thinkes:
7 2096 And I haue found Demetrius, like a iewell,
7 2097 Mine owne, and not mine owne
7 2098 
7 2099    Dem. It seemes to mee,
7 2100 That yet we sleepe, we dreame. Do not you thinke,
7 2101 The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him?
7 2102   Her. Yea, and my Father
7 2103 
7 2104    Hel. And Hippolita
7 2105 
7 2106    Lys. And he bid vs follow to the Temple
7 2107 
7 2108    Dem. Why then we are awake; lets follow him, and
7 2109 by the way let vs recount our dreames.
7 2110 
7 2111 Bottome wakes.
7 2112 
7 2113 Exit Louers.
7 2114 
7 2115   Clo. When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer.
7 2116 My next is, most faire Piramus. Hey ho. Peter Quince?
7 2117 Flute the bellowes-mender? Snout the tinker? Starueling?
7 2118 Gods my life! Stolne hence, and left me asleepe: I
7 2119 haue had a most rare vision. I had a dreame, past the wit
7 2120 of man, to say, what dreame it was. Man is but an Asse,
7 2121 if he goe about to expound this dreame. Me-thought I
7 2122 was, there is no man can tell what. Me-thought I was,
7 2123 and me-thought I had. But man is but a patch'd foole,
7 2124 if he will offer to say, what me-thought I had. The eye of
7 2125 man hath not heard, the eare of man hath not seen, mans
7 2126 hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceiue, nor his
7 2127 heart to report, what my dreame was. I will get Peter
7 2128 Quince to write a ballet of this dreame, it shall be called
7 2129 Bottomes Dreame, because it hath no bottome; and I will
7 2130 sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peraduenture,
7 2131 to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it
7 2132 at her death.
7 2133 Enter.
7 2134 
7 2135 Enter Quince, Flute, Thisbie, Snout, and Starueling.
7 2136 
7 2137   Quin. Haue you sent to Bottomes house? Is he come
7 2138 home yet?
7 2139   Staru. He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt hee is
7 2140 transported
7 2141 
7 2142    This. If he come not, then the play is mar'd. It goes
7 2143 not forward, doth it?
7 2144   Quin. It is not possible: you haue not a man in all
7 2145 Athens, able to discharge Piramus but he
7 2146 
7 2147    This. No, hee hath simply the best wit of any handycraft
7 2148 man in Athens
7 2149 
7 2150    Quin. Yea, and the best person too, and hee is a very
7 2151 Paramour, for a sweet voyce
7 2152 
7 2153    This. You must say, Paragon. A Paramour is (God
7 2154 blesse vs) a thing of nought.
7 2155 Enter Snug the Ioyner.
7 2156 
7 2157   Snug. Masters, the Duke is comming from the Temple,
7 2158 and there is two or three Lords & Ladies more married.
7 2159 If our sport had gone forward, we had all bin made
7 2160 men
7 2161 
7 2162    This. O sweet bully Bottome: thus hath he lost sixepence
7 2163 a day, during his life; he could not haue scaped sixpence
7 2164 a day. And the Duke had not giuen him sixpence
7 2165 a day for playing Piramus, Ile be hang'd. He would haue
7 2166 deserued it. Sixpence a day in Piramus, or nothing.
7 2167 Enter Bottome.
7 2168 
7 2169   Bot. Where are these Lads? Where are these hearts?
7 2170   Quin. Bottome, o most couragious day! O most happie
7 2171 houre!
7 2172   Bot. Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me
7 2173 not what. For if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
7 2174 will tell you euery thing as it fell out
7 2175 
7 2176    Qu. Let vs heare, sweet Bottome
7 2177 
7 2178    Bot. Not a word of me: all that I will tell you, is, that
7 2179 the Duke hath dined. Get your apparell together, good
7 2180 strings to your beards, new ribbands to your pumps,
7 2181 meete presently at the Palace, euery man looke ore his
7 2182 part: for the short and the long is, our play is preferred:
7 2183 In any case let Thisby haue cleane linnen: and let not him
7 2184 that playes the Lion, paire his nailes, for they shall hang
7 2185 out for the Lions clawes. And most deare Actors, eate
7 2186 no Onions, nor Garlicke; for wee are to vtter sweete
7 2187 breath, and I doe not doubt but to heare them say, it is a
7 2188 sweet Comedy. No more words: away, go away.
7 2189 
7 2190 Exeunt.
7 2191 
7 2192 
7 2193 Actus Quintus.
7 2194 
7 2195 Enter Theseus, Hippolita, Egeus and his Lords.
7 2196 
7 2197   Hip. 'Tis strange my Theseus, y these louers speake of
7 2198 
7 2199    The. More strange then true. I neuer may beleeue
7 2200 These anticke fables, nor these Fairy toyes,
7 2201 Louers and mad men haue such seething braines,
7 2202 Such shaping phantasies, that apprehend more
7 2203 Then coole reason euer comprehends.
7 2204 The Lunaticke, the Louer, and the Poet,
7 2205 Are of imagination all compact.
7 2206 One sees more diuels then vaste hell can hold;
7 2207 That is the mad man. The Louer, all as franticke,
7 2208 Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egipt.
7 2209 The Poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling, doth glance
7 2210 From heauen to earth, from earth to heauen.
7 2211 And as imagination bodies forth the forms of things
7 2212 Vnknowne; the Poets pen turnes them to shapes,
7 2213 And giues to aire nothing, a locall habitation,
7 2214 And a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination,
7 2215 That if it would but apprehend some ioy,
7 2216 It comprehends some bringer of that ioy.
7 2217 Or in the night, imagining some feare,
7 2218 Howe easie is a bush suppos'd a Beare?
7 2219   Hip. But all the storie of the night told ouer,
7 2220 And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
7 2221 More witnesseth than fancies images,
7 2222 And growes to something of great constancie;
7 2223 But howsoeuer, strange, and admirable.
7 2224 Enter louers, Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.
7 2225 
7 2226   The. Heere come the louers, full of ioy and mirth:
7 2227 Ioy, gentle friends, ioy and fresh dayes
7 2228 Of loue accompany your hearts
7 2229 
7 2230    Lys. More then to vs, waite in your royall walkes,
7 2231 your boord, your bed
7 2232 
7 2233    The. Come now, what maskes, what dances shall
7 2234 we haue,
7 2235 To weare away this long age of three houres,
7 2236 Between our after supper, and bed-time?
7 2237 Where is our vsuall manager of mirth?
7 2238 What Reuels are in hand? Is there no play,
7 2239 To ease the anguish of a torturing houre?
7 2240 Call Egeus
7 2241 
7 2242    Ege. Heere mighty Theseus
7 2243 
7 2244    The. Say, what abridgement haue you for this euening?
7 2245 What maske? What musicke? How shall we beguile
7 2246 The lazie time, if not with some delight?
7 2247   Ege. There is a breefe how many sports are rife:
7 2248 Make choise of which your Highnesse will see first
7 2249 
7 2250    Lis. The battell with the Centaurs to be sung
7 2251 By an Athenian Eunuch, to the Harpe
7 2252 
7 2253    The. Wee'l none of that. That haue I told my Loue
7 2254 In glory of my kinsman Hercules
7 2255 
7 2256    Lis. The riot of the tipsie Bachanals,
7 2257 Tearing the Thracian singer, in their rage?
7 2258   The. That is an old deuice, and it was plaid
7 2259 When I from Thebes came last a Conqueror
7 2260 
7 2261    Lis. The thrice three Muses, mourning for the death
7 2262 of learning, late deceast in beggerie
7 2263 
7 2264    The. That is some Satire keene and criticall,
7 2265 Not sorting with a nuptiall ceremonie
7 2266 
7 2267    Lis. A tedious breefe Scene of yong Piramus,
7 2268 And his loue Thisby; very tragicall mirth
7 2269 
7 2270    The. Merry and tragicall? Tedious, and briefe? That
7 2271 is, hot ice, and wondrous strange snow. How shall wee
7 2272 finde the concord of this discord?
7 2273   Ege. A play there is, my Lord, some ten words long,
7 2274 Which is as breefe, as I haue knowne a play;
7 2275 But by ten words, my Lord, it is too long;
7 2276 Which makes it tedious. For in all the play,
7 2277 There is not one word apt, one Player fitted.
7 2278 And tragicall my noble Lord it is: for Piramus
7 2279 Therein doth kill himselfe. Which when I saw
7 2280 Rehearst, I must confesse, made mine eyes water:
7 2281 But more merrie teares, the passion of loud laughter
7 2282 Neuer shed
7 2283 
7 2284    Thes. What are they that do play it?
7 2285   Ege. Hard handed men, that worke in Athens heere,
7 2286 Which neuer labour'd in their mindes till now;
7 2287 And now haue toyled their vnbreathed memories
7 2288 With this same play, against your nuptiall
7 2289 
7 2290    The. And we will heare it
7 2291 
7 2292    Hip. No my noble Lord, it is not for you. I haue heard
7 2293 It ouer, and it is nothing, nothing in the world;
7 2294 Vnless you can finde sport in their intents,
7 2295 Extreamely stretched, and cond with cruell paine,
7 2296 To doe you seruice
7 2297 
7 2298    Thes. I will heare that play. For neuer any thing
7 2299 Can be amisse, when simplenesse and duty tender it.
7 2300 Goe bring them in, and take your places, Ladies
7 2301 
7 2302    Hip. I loue not to see wretchednesse orecharged;
7 2303 And duty in his seruice perishing
7 2304 
7 2305    Thes. Why gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing
7 2306 
7 2307    Hip. He saies, they can doe nothing in this kinde
7 2308 
7 2309    Thes. The kinder we, to giue them thanks for nothing
7 2310 Our sport shall be, to take what they mistake;
7 2311 And what poore duty cannot doe, noble respect
7 2312 Takes it in might, not merit.
7 2313 Where I haue come, great Clearkes haue purposed
7 2314 To greete me with premeditated welcomes;
7 2315 Where I haue seene them shiuer and looke pale,
7 2316 Make periods in the midst of sentences,
7 2317 Throttle their practiz'd accent in their feares,
7 2318 And in conclusion, dumbly haue broke off,
7 2319 Not paying me a welcome. Trust me sweete,
7 2320 Out of this silence yet, I pickt a welcome:
7 2321 And in the modesty of fearefull duty,
7 2322 I read as much, as from the ratling tongue
7 2323 Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
7 2324 Loue therefore, and tongue-tide simplicity,
7 2325 In least, speake most, to my capacity
7 2326 
7 2327    Egeus. So please your Grace, the Prologue is addrest
7 2328 
7 2329    Duke. Let him approach.
7 2330 
7 2331 Flor. Trum.
7 2332 
7 2333 Enter the Prologue. Quince.
7 2334 
7 2335   Pro. If we offend, it is with our good will.
7 2336 That you should thinke, we come not to offend,
7 2337 But with good will. To shew our simple skill,
7 2338 That is the true beginning of our end.
7 2339 Consider then, we come but in despight.
7 2340 We do not come, as minding to content you,
7 2341 Our true intent is. All for your delight,
7 2342 We are not heere. That you should here repent you,
7 2343 The Actors are at hand; and by their show,
7 2344 You shall know all, that you are like to know
7 2345 
7 2346    Thes. This fellow doth not stand vpon points
7 2347 
7 2348    Lys. He hath rid his Prologue, like a rough Colt: he
7 2349 knowes not the stop. A good morall my lord. it is not
7 2350 enough to speake, but to speake true
7 2351 
7 2352    Hip. Indeed hee hath plaid on his Prologue, like a
7 2353 childe on a Recorder, a sound, but not in gouernment
7 2354 
7 2355    Thes. His speech was like a tangled chaine: nothing
7 2356 impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
7 2357 
7 2358 Tawyer with a Trumpet before them.
7 2359 
7 2360 Enter Pyramus and Thisby, Wall, Moone-shine, and Lyon.
7 2361 
7 2362   Prol. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show,
7 2363 But wonder on, till truth make all things plaine.
7 2364 This man is Piramus, if you would know;
7 2365 This beauteous Lady, Thisby is certaine.
7 2366 This man, with lyme and rough-cast, doth present
7 2367 Wall, that vile wall, which did these louers sunder:
7 2368 And through walls chink (poor soules) they are content
7 2369 To whisper. At the which, let no man wonder.
7 2370 This man, with Lanthorne, dog, and bush of thorne,
7 2371 Presenteth moone-shine. For if you will know,
7 2372 By moone-shine did these Louers thinke no scorne
7 2373 To meet at Ninus toombe, there, there to wooe:
7 2374 This grizly beast (which Lyon hight by name)
7 2375 The trusty Thisby, comming first by night,
7 2376 Did scarre away, or rather did affright:
7 2377 And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
7 2378 Which Lyon vile with bloody mouth did staine.
7 2379 Anon comes Piramus, sweet youth and tall,
7 2380 And findes his Thisbies Mantle slaine;
7 2381 Whereat, with blade, with bloody blamefull blade,
7 2382 He brauely broacht his boiling bloudy breast,
7 2383 And Thisby, tarrying in Mulberry shade,
7 2384 His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
7 2385 Let Lyon, Moone-shine, Wall, and Louers twaine,
7 2386 At large discourse, while here they doe remaine.
7 2387 
7 2388 Exit all but Wall.
7 2389 
7 2390   Thes. I wonder if the Lion be to speake
7 2391 
7 2392    Deme. No wonder, my Lord: one Lion may, when
7 2393 many Asses doe.
7 2394 
7 2395 Exit Lyon, Thisbie, and Mooneshine.
7 2396 
7 2397   Wall. In this same Interlude, it doth befall,
7 2398 That I, one Snowt (by name) present a wall:
7 2399 And such a wall, as I would haue you thinke,
7 2400 That had in it a crannied hole or chinke:
7 2401 Through which the Louers, Piramus and Thisbie
7 2402 Did whisper often, very secretly.
7 2403 This loame, this rough-cast, and this stone doth shew,
7 2404 That I am that same Wall; the truth is so.
7 2405 And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
7 2406 Through which the fearfull Louers are to whisper
7 2407 
7 2408    Thes. Would you desire Lime and Haire to speake
7 2409 better?
7 2410   Deme. It is the wittiest partition, that euer I heard
7 2411 discourse, my Lord
7 2412 
7 2413    Thes. Pyramus drawes neere the Wall, silence.
7 2414 Enter Pyramus.
7 2415 
7 2416   Pir. O grim lookt night, o night with hue so blacke,
7 2417 O night, which euer art, when day is not:
7 2418 O night, o night, alacke, alacke, alacke,
7 2419 I feare my Thisbies promise is forgot.
7 2420 And thou o wall, thou sweet and louely wall,
7 2421 That stands between her fathers ground and mine,
7 2422 Thou wall, o Wall, o sweet and louely wall,
7 2423 Shew me thy chinke, to blinke through with mine eine.
7 2424 Thankes courteous wall. Ioue shield thee well for this.
7 2425 But what see I? No Thisbie doe I see.
7 2426 O wicked wall, through whom I see no blisse,
7 2427 Curst be thy stones for thus deceiuing mee
7 2428 
7 2429    Thes. The wall me-thinkes being sensible, should
7 2430 curse againe
7 2431 
7 2432    Pir. No in truth sir, he should not. Deceiuing me,
7 2433 Is Thisbies cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy
7 2434 Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall.
7 2435 Enter Thisbie.
7 2436 
7 2437 Pat as I told you; yonder she comes
7 2438 
7 2439    This. O wall, full often hast thou heard my mones,
7 2440 For parting my faire Piramus, and me
7 2441 My cherry lips haue often kist thy stones;
7 2442 Thy stones with Lime and Haire knit vp in thee
7 2443 
7 2444    Pyra. I see a voyce; now will I to the chinke,
7 2445 To spy and I can heare my Thisbies face. Thisbie?
7 2446   This. My Loue thou art, my Loue I thinke
7 2447 
7 2448    Pir. Thinke what thou wilt, I am thy Louers grace,
7 2449 And like Limander am I trusty still
7 2450 
7 2451    This. And like Helen till the Fates me kill
7 2452 
7 2453    Pir. Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true
7 2454 
7 2455    This. As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you
7 2456 
7 2457    Pir. O kisse me through the hole of this vile wall
7 2458 
7 2459    This. I kisse the wals hole, not your lips at all
7 2460 
7 2461    Pir. Wilt thou at Ninnies tombe meete me straight
7 2462 way?
7 2463   This. Tide life, tide death, I come without delay
7 2464 
7 2465    Wall. Thus haue I Wall, my part discharged so;
7 2466 And being done, thus Wall away doth go.
7 2467 
7 2468 Exit Clow.
7 2469 
7 2470   Du. Now is the morall downe between the two
7 2471 Neighbours
7 2472 
7 2473    Dem. No remedie my Lord, when Wals are so wilfull,
7 2474 to heare without warning
7 2475 
7 2476    Dut. This is the silliest stuffe that ere I heard
7 2477 
7 2478    Du. The best in this kind are but shadowes, and the
7 2479 worst are no worse, if imagination amend them
7 2480 
7 2481    Dut. It must be your imagination then, & not theirs
7 2482 
7 2483    Duk. If wee imagine no worse of them then they of
7 2484 themselues, they may passe for excellent men. Here com
7 2485 two noble beasts, in a man and a Lion.
7 2486 Enter Lyon and Moone-shine
7 2487 
7 2488    Lyon. You Ladies, you (whose gentle harts do feare
7 2489 The smallest monstrous mouse that creepes on floore)
7 2490 May now perchance, both quake and tremble heere,
7 2491 When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roare.
7 2492 Then know that I, one Snug the Ioyner am
7 2493 A Lion fell, nor else no Lions dam:
7 2494 For if I should as Lion come in strife
7 2495 Into this place, 'twere pittie of my life
7 2496 
7 2497    Du. A verie gentle beast, and of good conscience
7 2498 
7 2499    Dem. The verie best at a beast, my Lord, y ere I saw
7 2500 
7 2501    Lis. This Lion is a verie Fox for his valor
7 2502 
7 2503    Du. True, and a Goose for his discretion
7 2504 
7 2505    Dem. Not so my Lord: for his valor cannot carrie
7 2506 his discretion, and the fox carries the Goose
7 2507 
7 2508    Du. His discretion I am sure cannot carrie his valor:
7 2509 for the Goose carries not the Fox. It is well; leaue it to
7 2510 his discretion, and let vs hearken to the Moone
7 2511 
7 2512    Moone. This Lanthorne doth the horned Moone present
7 2513 
7 2514    De. He should haue worne the hornes on his head
7 2515 
7 2516    Du. Hee is no crescent, and his hornes are inuisible,
7 2517 within the circumference
7 2518 
7 2519    Moon. This lanthorne doth the horned Moone present:
7 2520 My selfe, the man i'th Moone doth seeme to be
7 2521 
7 2522    Du. This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man
7 2523 Should be put into the Lanthorne. How is it els the man
7 2524 i'th Moone?
7 2525   Dem. He dares not come there for the candle.
7 2526 For you see, it is already in snuffe
7 2527 
7 2528    Dut. I am wearie of this Moone; would he would
7 2529 change
7 2530 
7 2531    Du. It appeares by his smal light of discretion, that
7 2532 he is in the wane: but yet in courtesie, in all reason, we
7 2533 must stay the time
7 2534 
7 2535    Lys. Proceed Moone
7 2536 
7 2537    Moon. All that I haue to say, is to tell you, that the
7 2538 Lanthorne is the Moone; I, the man in the Moone; this
7 2539 thorne bush; my thorne bush; and this dog, my dog
7 2540 
7 2541    Dem. Why all these should be in the Lanthorne: for
7 2542 they are in the Moone. But silence, heere comes Thisby.
7 2543 Enter Thisby.
7 2544 
7 2545   This. This is old Ninnies tombe: where is my loue?
7 2546   Lyon. Oh.
7 2547 
7 2548 The Lion roares, Thisby runs off.
7 2549 
7 2550   Dem. Well roar'd Lion
7 2551 
7 2552    Du. Well run Thisby
7 2553 
7 2554    Dut. Well shone Moone.
7 2555 Truly the Moone shines with a good grace
7 2556 
7 2557    Du. Wel mouz'd Lion
7 2558 
7 2559    Dem. And then came Piramus
7 2560 
7 2561    Lys. And so the Lion vanisht.
7 2562 Enter Piramus.
7 2563 
7 2564   Pyr. Sweet Moone, I thank thee for thy sunny beames,
7 2565 I thanke thee Moone, for shining now so bright:
7 2566 For by thy gracious, golden, glittering beames,
7 2567 I trust to taste of truest Thisbies sight.
7 2568 But stay: O spight! but marke, poore Knight,
7 2569 What dreadful dole is heere?
7 2570 Eyes do you see! How can it be!
7 2571 O dainty Ducke: O Deere!
7 2572 Thy mantle good; what staind with blood!
7 2573 Approch you furies fell:
7 2574 O Fates! come, come: Cut thred and thrum,
7 2575 Quaile, crush, conclude, and quell
7 2576 
7 2577    Du. This passion, and the death of a deare friend,
7 2578 Would go neere to make a man looke sad
7 2579 
7 2580    Dut. Beshrew my heart, but I pittie the man
7 2581 
7 2582    Pir. O wherefore Nature, did'st thou Lions frame?
7 2583 Since lion vilde hath heere deflour'd my deere:
7 2584 Which is: no, no, which was the fairest Dame
7 2585 That liu'd, that lou'd, that like'd, that look'd with cheere.
7 2586 Come teares, confound: Out sword, and wound
7 2587 The pap of Piramus:
7 2588 I, that left pap, where heart doth hop;
7 2589 Thus dye I, thus, thus, thus.
7 2590 Now am I dead, now am I fled, my soule is in the sky,
7 2591 Tongue lose thy light, Moone take thy flight,
7 2592 Now dye, dye, dye, dye, dye
7 2593 
7 2594    Dem. No Die, but an ace for him; for he is but one
7 2595 
7 2596    Lis. Lesse then an ace man. For he is dead, he is nothing
7 2597 
7 2598    Du. With the helpe of a Surgeon, he might yet recouer,
7 2599 and proue an Asse
7 2600 
7 2601    Dut. How chance Moone-shine is gone before?
7 2602 Thisby comes backe, and findes her Louer.
7 2603 Enter Thisby.
7 2604 
7 2605   Duke. She wil finde him by starre-light.
7 2606 Heere she comes, and her passion ends the play
7 2607 
7 2608    Dut. Me thinkes shee should not vse a long one for
7 2609 such a Piramus: I hope she will be breefe
7 2610 
7 2611    Dem. A Moth wil turne the ballance, which Piramus
7 2612 which Thisby is the better
7 2613 
7 2614    Lys. She hath spyed him already, with those sweete eyes
7 2615 
7 2616    Dem. And thus she meanes, videlicit
7 2617 
7 2618    This. Asleepe my Loue? What, dead my Doue?
7 2619 O Piramus arise:
7 2620 Speake, speake. Quite dumbe? Dead, dead? A tombe
7 2621 Must couer thy sweet eyes.
7 2622 These Lilly Lips, this cherry nose,
7 2623 These yellow Cowslip cheekes
7 2624 Are gone, are gone: Louers make mone:
7 2625 His eyes were greene as Leekes.
7 2626 O Sisters three, come, come to mee,
7 2627 With hands as pale as Milke,
7 2628 Lay them in gore, since you haue shore
7 2629 with sheeres, his thred of silke.
7 2630 Tongue not a word: Come trusty sword:
7 2631 Come blade, my brest imbrue:
7 2632 And farwell friends, thus Thisbie ends;
7 2633 Adieu, adieu, adieu
7 2634 
7 2635    Duk. Moone-shine & Lion are left to burie the dead
7 2636 
7 2637    Deme. I, and Wall too

7 2639    Bot. No, I assure you, the wall is downe, that parted
7 2640 their Fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or
7 2641 to heare a Bergomask dance, betweene two of our company?
7 2642   Duk. No Epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs
7 2643 no excuse. Neuer excuse; for when the plaiers are all
7 2644 dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if hee that
7 2645 writ it had plaid Piramus, and hung himselfe in Thisbies
7 2646 garter, it would haue beene a fine Tragedy: and so it is
7 2647 truely, and very notably discharg'd. but come, your
7 2648 Burgomaske; let your Epilogue alone.
7 2649 The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelue.
7 2650 Louers to bed, 'tis almost Fairy time.
7 2651 I feare we shall out-sleepe the comming morne,
7 2652 As much as we this night haue ouer-watcht.
7 2653 This palpable grosse play hath well beguil'd
7 2654 The heauy gate of night. Sweet friends to bed.
7 2655 A fortnight hold we this solemnity.
7 2656 In nightly Reuels; and new iollitie.
7 2657 
7 2658 Exeunt.
7 2659 
7 2660 Enter Pucke.
7 2661 
7 2662   Puck. Now the hungry Lyons rores,
7 2663 And the Wolfe beholds the Moone:
7 2664 Whilest the heauy ploughman snores,
7 2665 All with weary taske fore-done.
7 2666 Now the wasted brands doe glow,
7 2667 Whil'st the scritch-owle, scritching loud,
7 2668 Puts the wretch that lies in woe,
7 2669 In remembrance of a shrowd.
7 2670 Now it is the time of night,
7 2671 That the graues, all gaping wide,
7 2672 Euery one lets forth his spright,
7 2673 In the Church-way paths to glide,
7 2674 And we Fairies, that do runne,
7 2675 By the triple Hecates teame,
7 2676 From the presence of the Sunne,
7 2677 Following darkenesse like a dreame,
7 2678 Now are frollicke; not a Mouse
7 2679 Shall disturbe this hallowed house.
7 2680 I am sent with broome before,
7 2681 To sweep the dust behinde the doore.
7 2682 Enter King and Queene of Fairies, with their traine.
7 2683 
7 2684   Ob. Through the house giue glimmering light,
7 2685 By the dead and drowsie fier,
7 2686 Euerie Elfe and Fairie spright,
7 2687 Hop as light as bird from brier,
7 2688 And this Ditty after me, sing and dance it trippinglie,
7 2689   Tita. First rehearse this song by roate,
7 2690 To each word a warbling note.
7 2691 Hand in hand, with Fairie grace,
7 2692 Will we sing and blesse this place.
7 2693 
7 2694 The Song.
7 2695 
7 2696 Now vntill the breake of day,
7 2697 Through this house each Fairy stray.
7 2698 To the best Bride-bed will we,
7 2699 Which by vs shall blessed be:
7 2700 And the issue there create,
7 2701 Euer shall be fortunate:
7 2702 So shall all the couples three,
7 2703 Euer true in louing be:
7 2704 And the blots of Natures hand,
7 2705 Shall not in their issue stand.
7 2706 Neuer mole, harelip, nor scarre,
7 2707 nor mark prodigious, such as are
7 2708 Despised in Natiuitie,
7 2709 Shall vpon their children be.
7 2710 With this field dew consecrate,
7 2711 Euery Fairy take his gate,
7 2712 And each seuerall chamber blesse,
7 2713 Through this Pallace with sweet peace,
7 2714 Euer shall in safety rest.
7 2715 And the owner of it blest.
7 2716 Trip away, make no stay;
7 2717 Meet me all by breake of day
7 2718 
7 2719    Robin. If we shadowes haue offended,
7 2720 Thinke but this (and all is mended)
7 2721 That you haue but slumbred heere,
7 2722 While these Visions did appeare.
7 2723 And this weake and idle theame,
7 2724 No more yeelding but a dreame,
7 2725 Gentles, doe not reprehend.
7 2726 If you pardon, we will mend.
7 2727 And as I am an honest Pucke,
7 2728 If we haue vnearned lucke,
7 2729 Now to scape the Serpents tongue,
7 2730 We will make amends ere long:
7 2731 Else the Pucke a lyar call.
7 2732 So good night vnto you all.
7 2733 Giue me your hands, if we be friends,
7 2734 And Robin shall restore amends.
7 2735 
7 2736 FINIS. A MIDSOMMER Nights Dreame.
